SUBJ/FY-15 FULL TIME SUPPORT AVIATION COMMAND RETENTION BONUS// 

MSGID/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/N1/NOV//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the restoration of the Full Time Support 
(FTS) Aviation Command Retention Bonus (ACRB).  The ACRB is designed to 
retain, for continued naval service, those aviation officers with the talent 
and command experience in our primary warfighting missions that are critical 
for the future of our institution.  These O-5 commanding officers (CO) lead 
our naval aviation force today, and their skill set and leadership experience 
are essential to our Navy*s success in the future.

2.  All officers sitting in command of eligible units beginning
7 November 2014 are eligible to apply.  Prospective COs become eligible to 
apply for the FTS ACRB on the day they take command; eligibility to apply 
ends on the officer*s last day in command of the eligible unit.  All eligible 
officers will be offered $36,000, paid in two installments of $18,000, in 
return for a commitment to remain on active duty as a Naval Aviator or Naval 
Flight Officer through the end of their 22nd year of commissioned service, or 
for two years from the date of contract approval, whichever is later.
