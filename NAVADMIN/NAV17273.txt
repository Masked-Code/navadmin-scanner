NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 133/16, IMPLEMENTATION OF RETIREMENTS AND SEPARATIONS 
FUNCTIONALITY WITHIN NAVY STANDARD INTEGRATED PERSONNEL SYSTEM OVERVIEW.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces a self-service function for Retirements and 
Separations (RnS) within Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).  
This functionality allows members to initiate requests electronically via 
NSIPS self-service, route them through their chain of command for review and 
recommendation, and then electronically route the request to Navy Personnel 
Command for a decision.  This improvement provides transparency for our 
service members on the status of their requests, an integrated waiver process 
when needed, and electronic notification of the final disposition of requests 
for both the member and the command.  This new capability is another interim 
enhancement to our legacy systems, while the new systems and processes of 
Sailor 2025 are finalized.

2.  Commands with access to NSIPS Web are directed to set up their command 
hierarchy in preparation of full Fleet utilization by 1 January 2018.  The 
NSIPS Web-Afloat implementation timeline is dependent on the ship 
modernization process and will be completed in approximately 24 months.

3.  Directions for setting up the command hierarchy, which is necessary to 
for routing requests and other useful information to Navy Personnel Command, 
is posted on the NSIPS main page, beneath the Training section titled User 
Productivity Kit (UPK).  In the UPK section, select RnS Training then Command 
Setup Training.

4.  All officers submitting their voluntary resignation or retirement and 
enlisted personnel submitting their transfer request to the Fleet Reserve are 
must utilize NSIPS for requests initiated on or after 1 January 2018.  Since 
functionality is already available, members and commands may start to use 
NSIPS (RnS) immediately.  Members who are deployed without NSIPS Web access 
shall submit their request through their shore-based chain of command, who 
will then submit their request via NSIPS.  A sample demonstration of how to 
fill out a request is located in the RnS Training section of the UPKs.  
Statutory retirement notifications are now being generated through NSIPS to 
eliminate printing and distributing business letters via the postal service.  
The benefits of electronic delivery include a time/date stamp and a 
read/unread status, and the copy of the letter remains in the record of the 
member for future reference.  Service members must ensure their email 
addresses in NSIPS are correct to ensure timely delivery.
