NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 178/21, NAVY PERSONNEL AND PAY (NP2) SYSTEM DELIVERY 
PLAN PHASE 1 (DESIGNATION OF FUNCTIONAL ACCOUNT MANAGER (FAM).//

RMKS/1.  The initial operational capability date for Navy personnel and pay 
(NP2) has been delayed to mitigate risk to delivering Active and Reserve 
Component integration, treasury direct disbursing and to improve audit 
capability.  In line with reference (a), commands are required to designate 
their functional account manager (FAM) and request initial account creation.  
This NAVADMIN extends the deadline to submit FAM role requests in paragraph 1 
of reference (a) to 1 December 2021.

2.  It is crucial FAMs continue to submit and complete requests by 1 December 
2021 to ensure command FAMs are onboard, trained and ready to approve user 
roles.  The request for FAM access requires the member to upload the approved 
system authorization access request Navy (SAAR-N) PDF form with proof of 
completion of the current cyber awareness challenge training and the members 
command designation letter into the NP2 SAAR-N request at 
https://np2.navy.mil.  Due to the enduring nature of the FAM requirement, 
commands are to ensure the FAM role is never vacant as they are the final 
approval authority for their commands roles.  Timeline for additional user 
role submission will be promulgated in a subsequent NAVADMIN.

3.  To assist commands, the following documentation is located on
NP2 resources page of MyNavy Portal at https://my.navy.mil/np2.html.
    a.  NP2 SAAR-N routing process with step-by-step guidance.
    b.  SAAR-N PDF form template.
    c.  Sample FAM designation letter.

4.  Additional assistance, if required, can be requested through the MyNavy 
Career Center (MNCC) at (833) 330-MNCC or via e-mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil.
