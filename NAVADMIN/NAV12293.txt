RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE FY-12 FLIGHT HOUR VERIFICATION PROCESS 
FOR CONDITIONAL AVIATION CAREER INCENTIVE PAY (ACIP) AND HAZARDOUS DUTY 
INCENTIVE PAY (HDIP) FOR FLYING PROGRAMS.  PER REF A, THIS PROCESS ENABLES THE 
NAVY TO ACCURATELY COMPENSATE OFFICERS FOR FREQUENT AND REGULAR PERFORMANCE OF 
OPERATIONAL FLYING DUTY.  PER REF B, COMMANDING OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO TRACK 
AND REPORT FLIGHT HOURS FOR CONDITIONAL ACIP AND HDIP FOR FLYING RECIPIENTS.  
THIS VERIFICATION CERTIFIES THAT THE FY-12 MINIMUM FLIGHT HOUR REQUIREMENT WAS 
MET BY ALL FLYING RECIPIENTS ELIGIBLE FOR CONDITIONAL ACIP AND HDIP.

2.  CONDITIONAL ACIP MAY BE PAID TO THOSE AERONAUTICALLY DESIGNATED OFFICERS 
IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES:
    A.  AEROMEDICAL OFFICERS.
    B.  AVIATION OFFICERS NOT MEETING THE REQUIRED MONTHS OF FLYING (MOF) AT 
THE 12-YEAR OR 18-YEAR GATE AND NOT HAVING A SECNAV-APPROVED WAIVER.
    C.  AVIATION OFFICERS O6 AND BELOW WITH MORE THAN 25 YEARS OF AVIATION 
SERVICE.

3.  IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CONDITIONAL ACIP, AN OFFICER SHALL BE UNDER 
ORDERS TO DUTY IN A FLYING STATUS INVOLVING OPERATIONAL OR TRAINING FLIGHTS 
(DIFOPS), REPORTED INTO A BILLET DESIGNATED XXX1 OR
XXX2 (A DIFOPS BILLET), AND FLYING THE MINIMUM HOURS PRESCRIBED IN REF A.

4.  HDIP FOR FLYING MAY BE PAID TO NON-AERONAUTICALLY DESIGNATED OFFICERS AND 
AERONAUTICALLY DESIGNATED FLAG OFFICERS (WITH MORE THAN 25 YEARS OF AVIATION 
SERVICE) REQUIRED BY COMPETENT ORDERS TO PARTICIPATE IN REGULAR AND FREQUENT 
AERIAL FLIGHTS AS CREW OR NON-CREW MEMBERS.  HDIP FOR FLYING ELIGIBILITY 
REQUIRES A NON-AERONAUTICALLY DESIGNATED OFFICER TO BE UNDER ORDERS TO DUTY IN 
A FLYING STATUS AS A TECHNICAL OBSERVER (DIFTECH).  AN AERONAUTICALLY 
DESIGNATED FLAG OFFICER MUST BE UNDER ORDERS TO DIFOPS TO MAINTAIN HDIP FOR 
FLYING ELIGIBILITY.  ALL MUST FLY THE MINIMUM HOURS PRESCRIBED IN REF A.  
OFFICERS ENTITLED TO ACIP ARE NOT ENTITLED TO HDIP FOR FLYING.

5.  UPON THE END OF FY-12, ALL CONDITIONAL ACIP AND HDIP FOR FLYING RECIPIENTS 
WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FLIGHT HOURS FROM MAY 2011 TO SEPTEMBER 2012
