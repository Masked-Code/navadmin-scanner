SUBJ/ALASKA SEA SERVICES SCHOLARSHIP FOR ACADEMIC YEAR 2018-2019//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the requirements and solicits applications 
for the Alaska Sea Services Scholarship Program.  The Alaska Sea Services 
Scholarship awards up to four 1,000 dollar scholarships annually for 
undergraduate education to dependent children and spouses of Navy, Marine 
Corps, and Coast Guard personnel who legally claim Alaska as their state of 
residence. Applications are being accepted through 1 March 2018 for the FY-18 
selection board which convenes in April 2018.

2.  Background.  Citizens of Alaska raised funds for a 10,000 dollar war bond 
as a gift to the USS JUNEAU (CL 52) during World War II. After the sinking of 
the USS JUNEAU (CL 52), this gift was to have been presented to the USS 
ALASKA (CB 1), but the USS ALASKA (CB 1) was decommissioned before the 
presentation.  Consequently, the governor of the territory of Alaska and the 
Secretary of the Navy agreed that the bond would be left on deposit in the 
First National Bank of Juneau until the USS ALASKA (CB 1) was recommissioned 
or another appropriate application could be found.  In 1986, the Navy 
established the Alaska Sea Services fund.

3.  Requirements.  To be considered for the Alaska Sea Services Scholarship, 
an applicant must be the dependent (child or spouse) of a legal resident of 
the state of Alaska who is, or was at the time of death/designation as 
missing-in-action, a Regular or Reserve U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast 
Guard member on active-duty, inactive duty, or retired with or without pay.  
Selected candidates will be those who rate highest in five key areas below:
    a.  Academic proficiency,
    b.  Character,
    c.  Leadership ability,
    d.  Community involvement and
    e.  Financial need.

4.  Selection.  A selection panel appointed by the Navy League Foundation 
will screen all applications.  Their recommendations will then be submitted 
to Naval Education and Training Command (NETC) who will select the winner(s), 
after which selectees will be notified and scholarship funds will be 
disbursed to the appropriate academic institution.

5.  Applicant procedures.  Up to four 1,000 dollar scholarships are awarded 
to applicants who meet the specified criteria.  Applicants must also show 
acceptance at an accredited college or university for full-time undergraduate 
study for a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree.  No more than two 
scholarship awards may be given to any individual during pursuit of the four-
year degree.  Applications are now being accepted and will close on 1 March 
2018.  To apply on-line, visit the Navy League web site at
http://navyleague.org/scholarship.
