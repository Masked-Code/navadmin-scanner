RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces suspension of Active Component 
Cryptologic Warfare (CW) Limited Duty Officer (LDO) designator 681X 
accessions due to the overlap in CW LDO and Chief Warrant Officer 
(CWO) (781X) skill sets.  Formal disestablishment of the 681X 
designator will take place after natural attrition of current 
inventory. 
 
2.  The Navy suspended CW LDO 681X accessions beginning with the 
Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 In-Service Procurement Board, announced in 
reference (a).  The FY-22 (cycle year 2021) In-Service Procurement 
Board was the last board that selected CW LDO 681X officers.  Active 
component CW LDOs 681X are highly encouraged to complete CW officer 
(1810) requirements and submit redesignation without board action 
requests to 1810, consistent with references (b) and (c).  All 681X 
billets will be converted to either 781X or 181X in coordination 
with billet stakeholders.
