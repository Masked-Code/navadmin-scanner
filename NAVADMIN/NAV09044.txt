SUBJ/MANDATORY USE OF TRANSACTION ON-LINE PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR NON-
AFLOAT COMMANDS//
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE MANDATORY USE OF TRANSACTION 
ON-LINE PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR NON-AFLOAT COMMANDS.  THE PERSONNEL 
ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT SYSTEM (PASS) PROGRAM HAS DEVELOPED AN 
INTERNET-BASED SYSTEM, AVAILABLE 24/7, TO SECURELY TRANSMIT 
SENSITIVE, PERSONAL-PRIVATE INFORMATION FROM COMMANDS TO PERSONNEL 
SUPPORT DETACHMENTS (PSD).  TRANSACTION ON-LINE PROCESSING SYSTEM 
(TOPS) IS AN ON-LINE DATABASE WHICH ENABLES REMOTE TRANSACTION 
SUBMISSIONS AND DESKTOP DELIVERY, PLUS COMPLETE TRACKING 
CAPABILITIES FOR ALL PAY AND PERSONNEL RELATED TRANSACTIONS.  TOPS 
ALLOWS COMMAND PASS COORDINATORS (CPC'S) TO SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY 
COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR DESIGNATED HOMEPORT-SERVICING PSD VIA THE 
INTERNET.  THIS STREAMLINED APPROACH IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE 
NAVY DISTANCE SUPPORT PROGRAM AND SUPPORTS OPERATIONAL READINESS 
BY ALLOWING PASS CUSTOMERS TO CONTINUE WORKING AT THEIR PARENT COMMAND
REGARDLESS OF LOCATION OR DEPLOYMENT SCHEDULE. 
2.  ALL NON-AFLOAT COMMANDS SERVICED BY A PSD SHALL HAVE THEIR 
RESPECTIVE CPC ESTABLISH A TOPS ACCOUNT NOT LATER THAN 1 MARCH 2009.
EFFECTIVE 1 MARCH 2009, ALL PAY AND PERSONNEL RELATED TRANSACTIONS FOR
NON-AFLOAT COMMANDS SERVICED BY A PSD SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA TOPS.  FOR
ACCOUNT REQUESTS, CPC'S SHOULD CONTACT THEIR COMMAND'S SUPPORTING PSD.
3.  TOPS WORKS IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO A COMMERCIAL E-MAIL ACCOUNT 
AND REQUIRES AN INTERNET CONNECTION WITH COMMON ACCESS CARD (CAC) 
CAPABILITY AND A LOGIN ACCOUNT.  ONCE AN ACCOUNT IS OBTAINED VIA THE 
PARENT
COMMAND'S SERVICING PSD, USERS ARE GRANTED ACCESS TO THE 
SECURE PORTAL USING COMMON ACCESS CARD AUTHORIZATION.  INDIVIDUAL 
TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS HAZARDOUS DUTY PAY, PAY CORRECTIONS, SGLI 
ACCURACY, TRAVEL CLAIM LIQUIDATIONS, ALLOTMENTS, ETC., WILL TAKE 
LESS TIME TO PROCESS AND CAN BE COMPLETED WITHOUT THE SAILOR OR CPC 
LEAVING THE PARENT COMMAND, WHETHER DEPLOYED OR IN HOMEPORT.  IN 
NOVEMBER, APPROXIMATELY 47,000 TRANSACTIONS WERE COMPLETED VIA TOPS 
WITH AN AVERAGE TURNAROUND TIME BY PSD OF 3.7 DAYS.  MORE 
INFORMATION ABOUT TOPS CAN BE OBTAINED BY CONTACTING THE TOPS 
TECHNOLOGY TEAM HELP DESK AT (619) 532-2428/DSN 522 OR EMAIL AT MPS-
TOPS(AT)NAVY.MIL.  THE TOPS WEBSITE IS LOCATED AT 
HTTP://WWW.NPPSC.NAVY.MIL/TOPSWELCOME1.ASP.  
4.  TOPS IS BEING IMPLEMENTED ON THE NAVY INFORMATION/APPLICATIONS 
PRODUCT SUITE (NIAPS) AND AN AT-SEA TESTING PERIOD IS BEING 
CONDUCTED TO SUBSTANTIATE CAPABILITY PRIOR TO MANDATORY USE BY 
AFLOAT UNITS.  AFLOAT COMMANDS CURRENTLY USING TOPS ARE ENCOURAGED 
TO CONTINUE USING THE SYSTEM.  AFLOAT COMMANDS WHICH DESIRE TO USE 
TOPS PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION ON NIAPS SHOULD COORDINATE WITH THEIR 
SERVICING PSD.
5.  POINT OF CONTACT IS MR. JOHN GRIGSBY, NPPSC N145, AT (619) 532-
2270/DSN 522 OR EMAIL AT JOHN.L.GRIGSBY(AT)NAVY.MIL.
