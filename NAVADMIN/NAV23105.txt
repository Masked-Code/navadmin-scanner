RMKS/1.  Per reference (a), issuance of Department of Defense (DoD) Civilian 
Retiree Identification (ID) Cards has been terminated.  Previously issued DoD 
Civilian Retiree ID Cards will be effective through 31 August 2023.  This 
NAVADMIN provides amplifying guidance to ensure appropriate communication and 
access control measures are in place. 
 
2.  Background and Purpose.  Reference (b) established the use of trusted 
credentials for civilian retirees at the discretion of the installation 
commanders.  DoD ID's enabled Commanding Officers to authorize limited use of 
morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) activities on the installation of the 
DoD civilian retirees.  This was allowed as the authorized purpose for 
access.  Per reference (a), this credential will no longer be issued, 
effective immediately.  Previously issued DoD Civilian Retiree ID cards will 
remain valid through 31 August 2023, at which point they will no longer be 
accepted as a valid form of ID.  Personnel shall coordinate with the 
respective Visitor Control Center (VCC) where they will be processed in 
accordance with local policy.  Defense Biometric Identifications Systems 
(DBIDS) credentials will be issued to eligible personnel upon positive 
identification of the individual, visual inspection of an SF-50 indicating 
retirement from civilian government service, and vetting for 
fitness.  Visit https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/forms/i-
9.pdf for more information on acceptable forms of identification.  DBIDS 
credentials issued to eligible personnel will include "MWR Facility 
Privileges" on the back in the "Remarks" box, and be assigned to the 
"Facility Use" (Yellow) category during enrollment as delignated in reference 
(c). 
 
3.  The limited use of MWR activities by DoD civilian retirees will remain at 
the discretion of the installation Commanding Officer. 
 
4.  Commander, Navy Installations Command will ensure that installation VCC 
processes will continue to follow the procedures outlined in reference (d), 
and will advertise the use of the DBIDS pre-registration portal 
(https://dbids-global-enroll.dmdc.mil/preenrollui/#!/) to alleviate customer 
wait times.  The DBIDS pre-registration portal now meets DoD requirements and 
can be used in place of the SECNAV Form 5512/1.  Installations will update 
local access control policies, training, and public guidance (websites, 
Public Affairs Officer messaging, etc.) to ensure visitors are aware of the 
process and option to register prior to arrival. 
 
5.  Installation Access Control personnel will refer to reference (d) and the 
DBIDS Wiki (https://paws.dmdc.osd.mil/wiki/) for further information and 
training modules in support of executing the access control program.
