RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces convening of the November 2016 Active Duty 
Officer Lateral Transfer/Redesignation Board.  The lateral transfer and 
redesignation process is a key tool by which Navy manages the talents of its 
officers.  It provides flexibility in officer community manning and improves 
the Navys return on investment in officer training and education by 
optimizing the specialized skillsets of officers throughout their careers.  
As part of the process, applications from qualified unrestricted line, 
restricted line, staff corps, and limited duty officers (LDO) are now being 
accepted for an Active Duty Officer Lateral Transfer /Redesignation Board 
which convenes 07 November 2016.  Full-Time Support (FTS) and Selected 
Reserve (SELRES) officers are not eligible to apply for this board.

2.  In addition to the year group (YG) limitations imposed in paragraph 6, 
applicants must also meet eligibility requirements detailed in references (a) 
through (c) and are required to review and comply with any additional 
community requirements found in the November 2016 Letter of Instruction 
located at: http:/ /www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/boards/administrative
/TransferRedesignation/Pages/Status.aspx.
    a.  Members who do not meet eligibility requirements per references (a) 
through (c) such as time-in-grade, years-of -commissioned service (YCS), or 
time-in-service must submit a waiver request in addition to their lateral 
transfer/redesignation application.
    b.  Waiver request must include member's waiver request and commanding 
officer's endorsement.  This endorsement is separate from any endorsements 
contained in the member's lateral transfer /redesignation application and 
must specifically address the eligibility requirement for a waiver.

3.  Submit applications and waiver request, using the format in reference 
(b), to the address below:

7.  Notes:
    a. Must have Surface Warfare Officers (SWO) qualification completed to 
apply for transfer. Officers under SWO Continuation Pay (SWOCP), Revised 
Junior Critical Skills Retention Bonus (RJCSRB), or Department Head Retention 
Bonus (DHRB) contract are not eligible for transfer until completion of bonus 
obligation. SWOs serving under an agreement for any of the SWO bonuses are 
eligible to apply to the board if the board convening date is within one year 
of satisfaction of the full bonus obligation. Quotas out may be limited due 
to manning levels for any given Year Group, the community's billet 
requirements, the status of DH contract goals for Year Groups with less than 
six years of commissioned service, and the individual officer's assignment 
status. Specifically, officers within their detailing window must communicate 
with their detailer prior to submitting a lateral transfer application. 
Executing orders or slating to a billet will disqualify an officer for 
consideration and release from the community until arrival to the next duty 
station.
    b.  Waivers to the requirements of paragraph 4h of reference (b) for 
nuclear-trained surface and submarine warfare officers may be considered on a 
case-by-case basis.
    c.  Board applicants commissioned under a still-valid SWO-option 
agreement (Engineering Duty, Intel, IP, CW, OCEANO) must contact their 
respective restricted line option community manager regarding desire to be 
released from the SWO-option agreement and seek lateral transfer to a 
different community.
    d.  Nuclear-trained Surface Warfare Officers YG-11 and senior are 
available for lateral transfer consideration.
    e.  Officers screened "not cleared" for their next career milestone are 
eligible.
    f.  The YG range provided displays possible opportunities.  Contact your 
specific community placement officer  with questions regarding quota 
availability for each Type /Model/Series/Year Group.  General aviation 
officers (1300) are eligible to apply for lateral transfer regardless of 
Active Duty Service Obligation (ADSO) from winging.  Aviation officers (131X 
and
132X) are eligible to apply for lateral transfer if the officer has fulfilled 
ADSO, or will be within 12 months of completing ADSO at the time the board 
convenes.  Aviation officers with obligated service as a result of Aviation 
Career Continuation Pay (ACCP) are eligible to apply if the officer will be 
within 12 months of completing ACCP obligation at the time the Board 
convenes.  Additionally, aviation officers with obligated service as a result 
of ACCP are eligible to apply if the officer will be within
12 months of department head tour projected rotation date (PRD) at the time 
the board convenes, regardless of contrary ACCP contract language. 
Redesignation immediately following department head tour may result in 
cancelation of ACCP, which will be adjudicated by PERS -43.  Aviation 
lieutenants in a Failure of Selection (FOS) status to LCDR are eligible to 
apply regardless of ADSO or ACCP obligation.  Graduates from U.S Naval Test 
Pilot School class 147 and 148 may apply for AEDO only, regardless of ADSO 
(contact AEDO
Officer Community Manager (OCM) for details).   If selected,
aviation officers shall not be permitted to redesignate until completion of 
ADSO, fulfillment/expiration/cancellation of ACCP contract, or PRD, as 
determined by Aviation OCM (BUPERS -313).  Aviation officers in operational 
flying billets (billet designator XXX1 or XXX2) will not be permitted to 
redesignate until vacating the billet, typically at PRD.  BUPERS-313 
authorizes redesignation timing.  By accepting a lateral transfer out of 
Aviation (13XX) an officer consents to voluntary termination of flight status 
(except for AEDO selects) effective the date of redesignation with the 
Lateral Transfer Application and CO's endorsement fulfilling the requirements 
set forth in reference (h).
    g.  Engineering Duty Community
        (1) Applicants desiring out quota from Engineering Duty:
            (a) ED out-quotas are extremely limited.  Redesignation requests 
shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis with careful consideration given to 
impact on overall community health.
            (b) Applicants must have fulfilled at least 24 months of their 
postgraduate education payback tour in order to apply.
        (2) Applicants desiring redesignation to Engineering Duty:
            (a) Officers without a warfare qualification are expected to 
submit an application for the ED dolphin program per reference(i).
            (b) YGs 12, 11, 06, 04 have highest anticipated inventory 
requirement.  Inventory requirements for YGs 10-07 and 05 are met; however, 
well qualified officers, especially those already possessing qualifying 
subspecialty codes or currently engaged in technical masters program leading 
to qualifying subspecialty codes, may be considered in limited instances.
    h. Civil Engineer Corps (CEC) officers under CEC CSRB contract are 
eligible to apply to the board if the board application due date is within 
one year of satisfaction of the full bonus obligation.  Officers with more 
than one year of obligation remaining on their CEC CSRB contract may submit a 
waiver to be released prior to fulfillment of their bonus obligation.  
Waivers shall be submitted to the CEC OCM for review on a case by case basis 
and can be submitted with the application.  If approved, the notice of 
approval for early release from the CSRB contract shall be included with the 
lateral transfer application.  Release from the CSRB contract will be 
considered a voluntary release subject to repayment of any unearned amount.
    i.  LDO redesignation requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, 
considering impact to overall community health.  Nuclear LDO submissions will 
not be considered.  All other designators must have completed four years 
commissioned service and accepted permanent LDO appointment to LT prior to 
lateral transfer/redesignation.  LDO out quotas are extremely limited, 
special consideration will be given to officers projected to be statutorily 
separated for years of service prior to attaining the rank of Commander.  
Information Warfare Community applicants in YG's 11 and senior will receive 
favorable consideration.

    m.  Officers in all eligible YGs with Operations Analysis (OA) 
subspecialty (321X) and/or those with an APC of 325 or better are encouraged 
and eligible to apply to Human Resources (325 APC equates to 2.2 or better
