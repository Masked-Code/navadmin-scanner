RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides amplifying guidance to reference (a), which 
was released to address changes to security clearance background 
investigation procedures and implement the deferment process for Tier 3 
(Secret)/Tier 5 (Top Secret//Sensitive Compartmented Information) 
Reinvestigations (T3R/T5R) identified in references (b) and (c) as a means of 
reducing the background investigation backlog.  There are no changes in the 
process of initiating initial Tier 3 and Tier 5 Investigations (T3/T5).  The 
deferment process provides a decision matrix to determine whether a T3R/T5R 
should be submitted as a reinvestigation in Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigation Processing (e-QIP) or can be submitted to Defense Manpower Data 
Center (DMDC) for entry into the Continuous Evaluation (CE) program.

2.  Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) is the current security system 
of record.  Defense Information System for Security (DISS) is the means to 
perform some functions to include verifying the CE enrollment date based on 
reinvestigation deferment.

3.  The deferment process for T3R/T5R requires the Command Special Security 
Officers (SSO) or Command Security Managers (CSM) to validate the requirement 
for a reinvestigation as previously conducted.  The SSO/CSM confirms a 
members eligibility is still required based on the individuals position 
sensitivity; and there are no other ongoing investigations which meet the 
vetting requirements of the position, prior to initiating the Standard
Form-86 (SF-86) for reinvestigation in e-QIP.

4.  Once the SF-86 is submitted to the security office for review, the 
SSO/CSM is required to review the SF-86 using the Department of Defense (DoD) 
SF-86 Screening Matrix.  The Screening Matrix provides a list of potential 
flags on the SF-86, and what action is to be taken for each flag.  Based on 
the SSO/CSM review, the SF-86 is
either:
    a.  With flags, released in e-Qip and sent to National Background 
Investigation Bureau (NBIB) as traditionally done for reinvestigation.
    b.  With no flags, downloaded from e-Qip and sent to the Echelon I or II 
SSO/CSM for enrollment in the CE program.
    c.  With no flags and CE enrollment confirmed in DISS, no further action 
is needed.

5.  Commands submitting case files for CE enrollment are required to:
    a.  Review the SF-86 to ensure all information is replicated in  JPAS in 
order for the deferment to be accepted.  In the event of a matching error, 
contact the DMDC call center at (800) 467-5526 for resolution and ensure the 
Human Resources/Personnel system of record is accurate.
    b.  Extract the SF-86 file from e-Qip and forward the file to the Echelon 
I or II Security Officer.  The process for exporting SF-86 as an .xml file 
is:
        (1) In e-Qip, select investigation to be extracted
        (2) Select ATTACHMENT tab
        (3) Select the PRINTABLES radio button
        (4) Select EXPORT SUBMISSION DATAT (XML) hyperlink
        (5) Right click on data and SELECT ALL
        (6) Right click and select SAVE TARGET AS .xml format
        (7) Save subject files as:
            LastName_FirstName_LastFourSSN.xml
            i.e., (Smith_John_1234.xml)
            The .xml extension should be saved as lower case.
    c.  Submit xml file to the echelon I or II Security Office for submission 
to DMDC for CE enrollment.

6.  Echelon I and II commands must register no more than three 
representatives who will be authorized to submit case files to DMDC for CE 
enrollment.  Echelon I and II SSO/CSM should contact Deputy Under Security of 
the Navy (DUSN), Security Directorate at:
donsecurity_pers.fct(at)navy.mil to register.  Files submitted by 
unauthorized personnel will be rejected and not enrolled into CE.

7.  To submit CE enrollment files to DMDC, echelon I and II commands are 
required to:
    a.  Group all .xml files into a single zip file, for one weekly 
submission.  Do not send subject files individually if there are multiples to 
submit.
    b.  Include the word Navy in the subject line of the email.
    c.  Submit the .xml zip file by email each Tuesday by 1100 PST.
    d.  Email addresses to send the encrypted zipped xml files will be 
provided by DUSN Security Directorate when registering authorized Echelon I 
and II users.

8.  DoD personnel enrolled in CE will retain their existing eligibility.  
Under the rules of reciprocity as mandated by the applicable policy, existing 
eligibility remains valid until the
individual:
    a.  Is removed from CE
    b.  No longer has any DOD affiliation
    c.  Eligibility is revoked or suspended
    d.  CE enrollment dates prior to August 2018 are not valid as they were 
part of the CE test program.  For members with prior CE dates, submit 
reinvestigations as per references (b) and (c).

9.  SSO/CSM are advised to communicate CE enrollment to the employee; and to 
advise the employee to maintain a copy of the SF-86.

10.  Based on frequently asked questions, the following information is 
provided.
    a.  ALNAV 059/18 deferment policy and guidance only applies to T3R/T5Rs.
    b. The CE enrollment date will be used as the investigation date once 
enrolled into CE deferment.
    c.  Employees will remain in CE deferment until one of the conditions in 
paragraph 8 above is met.
    d.  Currently the CE enrollment date is only available in DISS.
    e.  Personnel enrolled in CE do not receive a new eligibility date; they 
retain their existing eligibility.
    f.  There is no separate guidance regarding established control programs.  
All reinvestigations should be processed as per ALNAV 059/18, and existing 
eligibility remains as stated above.
    g.  Until otherwise directed, submit any required reinvestigations for 
members enrolled in CE as warranted by the level of clearance eligibility 
required.  Use the last closed investigation date or CE enrollment date, 
whichever is later, to determine reinvestigation periodicity requirements.

11.  References and applicable documents identified in the NAVADMIN may be 
downloaded from the DUSN Security portal at:

12.  Direct any questions to the point of contact, Ms. Jennifer Floyd, (703) 
604-5564 or jennifer.floyd3(at)navy.mil.
