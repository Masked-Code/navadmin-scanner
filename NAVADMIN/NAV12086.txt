RMKS/1. AS PART OF REF A REENGINEERING EFFORT, N8F/N9I WILL CONVENE A  WORKING 
GROUP ON 28 MAR 2012 AT 1300 IN THE PENTAGON (RM 4D440) TO  PROVIDE 
STAKEHOLDERS IN THE EQUIPMENT REMOVAL/INVENTORY MANAGEMENT  PROCESS (TO 
INCLUDE REPRESENATIVES FROM PEO'S, DASN(SHIPS/WEAPONS),  SYSCOMS, NAVY IPO, 
OPNAV RESOURCE SPONSORS, FLEET REPS, PROGRAM  OFFICES, ITEM MANAGERS AND 
ISEA'S) AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS  REQUIREMENTS FOR THE REMOVAL OF EQUIPMENT 
FROM INACTIVATING SHIPS  DESIGNATED TO BE RETAINED FOR FUTURE MOBILIZATION 
PURPOSES  (OCIR/OSIR), AS CANDIDATES FOR POTENTIAL (HOT/COLD) FMS TRANSFER AND  
SHIPS TRANISTIONING FROM A RETENTION OR FMS HOLD STATUS TO A  DISPOSAL STATUS.

2.  THE WORKING GROUP WILL REVIEW REF A POLICY UNDER WHICH IDENTIFIES  THE 
TYPES OF MATERIAL TO BE REMOVED OR RETAINED ON INACTIVATING  SHIPS IAW THEIR 
EXPECTED DISPOSITION.  REF B POLICY PERTAINS TO  GENERAL CATEGORIES OF SYSTEMS 
THAT ARE TO BE RETAINED OR REMOVED  PRIOR TO EACH SHIPS TRANSFER UNDER FMS.

3.  WITH THE IMPENDING INACTIVATION OF 22 FFG 7 CLASS FRIGATES IN POM  13, ONE 
OF THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THE WORKING GROUP WILL BE TO DEVELOP  EQUIPMENT 
REMOVAL POLICY THAT BALANCES THE LOGISTICAL NEEDS OF THE  U.S. NAVY AND THE 
CAPABILITY NEEDS OF OUR MARITIME PARTNERS WHEN  AUTHORIZING REMOVALS. 
EXCESSIVE STRIPPING OF POTENTIAL FMS  DESIGNATED SHIPS PROVIDES A LESS 
OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY TO OUR  MARITIME PARTNERS AND CORRODES USN EFFORTS TO 
BUILD MARITIME PARTNER  CAPACITY.

EXPRESSED INTEREST IN ALL ASPECTS OF EQUIPMENT REMOVALS AND WILL  ALSO BE THE
