REF/A/DOC/SECNAV/6FEB18//

AMPN/REF A IS SECNAVINST 7220.88, AVIATION INCENTIVE PAYS AND BONUS 
PROGRAM.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Full-Time Support 
(FTS) Aviation Department Head Retention Bonus (ADHRB) Program.  A vital part 
of developing a total force strategy and maintaining combat readiness is to 
provide appropriate incentives to retain skilled personnel for critical naval 
aviation enterprise billets.  The FTS ADHRB Program provides selected bonuses 
as an incentive to eligible pilots and naval flight officers (NFO) serving in 
department head (DH) billets during FY-20 and to retain those officers 
through a post-DH aviation staff tour.

2.  The FY-20 FTS ADHRB Program continues the bonus system of previous years 
that is tied directly to force structure and targets aviators as they first 
become eligible.  Annual DH rates of up to
$35,000 are listed below and vary by community.  DH retention bonuses will be 
paid in three or five equal annual installments.  If a signed contract is 
received before completing 12 months of their initial DH tour, the Service 
Member is eligible for the five-year contract beginning on his or her one-
year anniversary as a DH in the squadron.  Service Members may sign up for 
the 3 year contract at any time during their initial DH tour, but will not be 
approved until after his or her 1 year anniversary as a DH in the squadron.
The following are the rates for squadron DH contracts:
HM  Pilot          		$25,000/YR
HSC  Pilot         		$25,000/YR
HSM  Pilot         		$15,000/YR
HT  Pilot          		$15,000/YR
VAQ - Pilot/NFO     		$35,000/YR
VFA/C - Pilot/NFO	   	$35,000/YR
VP/VUP - Pilot/NFO       	$25,000/YR
VR  Pilot           		$35,000/YR
VT(JET) - Pilot/NFO  		$35,000/YR
VT(PROP) - Pilot/NFO 		$25,000/YR

3.  All signed contracts must be received by FTS Distribution and 
Augmentation Branch (PERS-46) by 31 August 2020.  For specific details,
