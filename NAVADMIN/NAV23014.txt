RETENTION.

RMKS/1.  The purpose of this Navy Administrative (NAVADMIN) message is to 
communicate required contents and routing procedures for Medical Retention 
Reviews (MRR) for Navy selected Reserve members, as required by references 
(a) and (b).  This communication is in advance of an update to the 
NAVMED P-117, Chapter 15, Article 23. 
 
2.  Echelon 5 medical departments will initiate an MRR if they determine 
that a Navy Reserve member has a service-limiting condition, which was not 
incurred on Active orders, does not improve within the period of Temporarily 
Not Physically Qualified (TNPQ), and the condition meets at least one of 
the following: 
    a.  Does not meet published retention standards in reference (b) and any 
future published Navy and Marine Corps-specific retention standards. 
    b.Makes Reserve member incapable of serving on a large deck surface 
ship with the medical support of a senior medical officer; 
    c.Requires a waiver to deploy per reference (c); or 
    d.Makes Reserve member incapable of working in an operational setting 
for at least six months without access to specialty medical care. 
    e.If it is unclear whether a Navy MRR submission is necessary and 
consistent with applicable guidance, the echelon 5 medical representative 
must discuss with the next higher echelon.  MRR submissions are often 
unnecessary for conditions that meet published medical retention standards 
and do not interfere with drilling or mobilization.  Medical representatives 
will consider both medical standards and the members ability to 
satisfactorily perform appropriate military duties commensurate with the 
members office, grade, rank, or rate.  A condition that does not necessitate 
an MRR, or which has been determined physically qualified (PQ) during an MRR, 
might still require an area of responsibility waiver if the Reserve member is 
mobilizing to a more restrictive theater. 
 
3.  The Navy MRR package will be sent, via appropriate chain of command, to 
the echelon 4 Medical Director for submission. 
 
4.  The echelon 4 Medical Director will review Navy MRR packages and provide 
one of the following recommendations regarding qualification for retention: 
    a.Physically qualified:  For Navy Selected Reserve deemed PQ for 
retention, echelon 4 will provide documentation of PQ status and a Page 13 
for entry into the members medical record. 
    b.Physically qualified for retention but with potential Mobilization 
limitations:  For Navy Selected Reserve deemed PQ but with potential 
Mobilization limitations, echelon 4 will submit determination to 
NAVPERSCOM (PERS-95) for message release. 
    c.Not physically qualified (NPQ):  All NPQ determinations by the echelon 
4 Medical Director will be routed to BUMED-N34 to determine whether NPQ 
retention is recommended, or NPQ retention is not recommended, prior to 
sending to PERS. 
For NPQ determinations, when a recommendation can be made regarding retention 
in the Reserve Component, BUMED will send the recommendation to NAVPERSCOM 
(PERS-95) for adjudication and final action. 
    d.If a recommendation cannot be made regarding retention (e.g., 
incomplete information, not enough time after treatment initiated to 
demonstrate stability or instability), the echelon 4 Medical Director or 
BUMED-N34 will request further information from the cognizant echelon 5 
medical representative and the member via the members administrative chain of 
command. 
 
5.  Receipt of Veterans Affairs disability compensation for one or more 
service-connected conditions does not, in and of itself, render a Service 
member unfit for retention.  Before initiating a Navy MRR, it is the 
responsibility of the echelon 4 and echelon 5 medical personnel to assess 
whether a Veteran Affair compensable condition will likely affect performance 
of duty, retention, or prevent the member from safely or effectively 
fulfilling duties during a mobilization or deployment commensurate with the 
members office, grade, rank, or rate. 
 
6.  Echelon 3 may develop standard operating procedures to assist echelon 5 
medical representatives on identifying conditions that require a Navy MRR. 
 
7.  Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery points of contact for procedural 
questions regarding this policy can be reached at 
usn.ncr.bumedfchva.list.m34@health.mil.  This mailbox is not configured to 
receive email containing protected health information or personally 
identifiable information. 
 
8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
