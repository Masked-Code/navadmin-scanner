SUBJ/2012 NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES 21 SEPTEMBER AS THE 2012 NATIONAL PRISONER OF 
WAR/MISSING IN ACTION (POW/MIA) RECOGNITION DAY.
NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY IS A NATIONAL DAY OF OBSERVANCE FOR AMERICANS 
TO OFFER REMEMBRANCE, HONOR, AND RESPECT TO THOSE WARRIORS WHO WERE PRISONERS 
OF WAR AND THOSE WHO REMAIN MISSING AS A RESULT OF OUR NATION'S CONFLICTS.  IT 
IS ALSO A DAY TO REMEMBER THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE SACRIFICED AND ENDURED ON 
BEHALF OF THEIR LOVED ONES.

2.  TO COMMEMORATE THIS EVENT, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS EXPECTED 
TO ISSUE A PRESIDENTIAL PROCLAMATION DESIGNATING 21 SEPTEMBER 2012 AS NATIONAL 
POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY.

3.  THE NAVY HAS OVER 33,000 UNACCOUNTED-FOR SAILORS FROM WORLD WAR II THRU 
THE PERSIAN GULF WAR.  EACH YEAR, NAVY'S POW/MIA SECTION ASSISTS WITH 
REPATRIATING SAILORS AND RETURNING THEM TO THEIR LOVED ONES FOR BURIAL IN OUR 
HOMELAND.

4.  "UNTIL THEY ARE HOME" IS THE THEME ESTABLISHED BY DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
FOR THIS YEAR'S POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY.  FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE THEME 
EMPHASIZES THE PATIENT SUFFERING OF THE FAMILIES OF OUR MISSING.  NAVY 
COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO HOST OR SUPPORT LOCAL NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION 
DAY ACTIVITIES.  ACTIVITIES FROM PREVIOUS YEARS INCLUDE DISPLAYING THE MISSING 
MAN TABLE IN A UNIT WORK SPACE, AND FORMAL CEREMONIES IN WHICH A FORMER POW OR 
FAMILY MEMBER OF A CURRENT MIA SAILOR IS A GUEST SPEAKER.

5.  THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PRISONER OF WAR/MISSING PERSONNEL OFFICE (DPMO) 
IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT LEADS OUR EFFORT TO ACCOUNT FOR MISSING
