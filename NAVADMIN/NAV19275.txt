RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces changes to the enlisted Professional 
Apprenticeship Career Track (PACT) program and expands upon the comprehensive 
PACT program policy and process changes announced in reference (a).  As 
outlined in references (b) and (c), command leadership engagement is critical 
to both the success of PACT program implementation and to ensure viable 
career paths for PACT Sailors.  Our PACT Sailors are entirely dependent on 
strong leadership and purposeful coaching to guarantee they have every 
opportunity to reach their maximum potential to best meet the needs of the 
Navy.

2.  Policy changes.  Effective immediately, PACT Sailors will be approved for 
designation based on the requisition for which they are selected in MyNavy 
Assignment (MNA).  Reference (d) is being updated to incorporate changes 
announced herein and in reference (a).
    a.  Designation process changes.  PACT Sailors are directed to apply for 
requisitions within ratings for which they are qualified as determined by 
Career Waypoints (C-WAY).  PACT Sailors will be precluded from applying for 
requisitions for which they are not qualified.  Prior to PACT Sailors 
entering their order negotiation window, commands are directed to perform 
Career Development Boards and report career and PACT intentions in C-WAY.
    b.  PACT Sailors will begin their rating designation process 12 months 
prior to their Projected Rotation Date (PRD) and remain eligible until 
selected for a rated requisition or until their soft end of active obligated 
service (SEAOS).
    c.  PACT Sailors are encouraged to submit up to seven applications each 
MNA cycle.  PACT transition detailers will consider the individual 
applications in MNA based on that PACT Sailors PRD, training availability to 
meet the requisition requirements and needs of the Navy when making job 
selections.  PACT Sailors will obtain their rating when orders are executed 
or, for those rates with lengthy A Schools, upon successful completion of the 
curriculum.

3.  Upon selection for orders, Sailors must obligate service (OBLISERV) to 
meet the prescribed sea tour for the rating selected; in some cases, OBLISERV 
may be deferred to achieve Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) eligibility.  
As outlined in reference (a), PACT Sailors who meet OBLISERV requirements for 
the new rating, or a minimum 24 months of additional sea time, whichever is 
greater, may be authorized advancement to E-4 with commanding officer 
approval.

4.  SRB policy reminder.  Once designated, eligible PACT Sailors may be 
eligible for SRB.  Check the latest SRB NAVADMIN for eligibility 
determination.

5.  PACT Sailors will receive sea duty credit for time served at sea.
PACT Sailors who decline to apply for designation will have their PRD 
adjusted to match their SEAOS.  Sailors who fail to apply to be designated or 
do not desire to be rated will remain a PACT for the duration of their 
enlistment and will not be eligible for reenlistment.

6.  Point of Contact.  MyNavy Career Center, (833) 830-MNCC/(833) 830-6622, 
via e- mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil or MyNavy Portal at https://my.navy.mil.

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.

8.  Released by Vice Admiral John B. Nowell, Jr, N1.//
