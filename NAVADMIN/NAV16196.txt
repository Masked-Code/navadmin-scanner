RMKS/1.  The Submarine Force and the Navy are pleased to announce the third 
cycle of female Sailor selections for conversion to Submarine Force ratings.  
This cycle of conversions will be for the initial enlisted integration of the 
USS OHIO (SSGN 726) submarine crews in Bangor, WA in 2018.

2.  The Submarine Force is seeking high caliber female applicants from all 
ratings.  Sailors from all communities are eligible to apply for submarine 
service as part of this initiative.  Per this NAVADMIN, the Submarine 
Enlisted Community Manager (ECM) is accepting conversion applications for 
ranks E-1 through E-8.
Additional information regarding the selection process and application 
requirements can be found at:
http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/ewis/Pages/default.aspx or 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/enlisted/community/submarine/
pages/EnlistedWomeninSubmarines.aspx.
    a.  Applications for E-7/8 will be accepted in the following
ratings:  Information Systems Technician (ITS) (see note 1 below), Logistics 
Specialist (LS), Culinary Specialist (CS), Yeoman (YN) (see note 2 below), 
and Independent Duty Corpsman (IDC).  Selected chief petty officers (CPO) are 
expected to report aboard and lead a division with minimal additional 
technical and leadership training.
Note 1:  CPO IT conversions must have one or more of the following Navy 
enlisted classifications:  2780, 2781, or 2791.
Note 2:  CPO Personnel Specialists are encouraged to apply.  Each application 
will be assessed to ensure the CPO has the experience and expertise to manage 
and oversee all administrative and personnel actions to support the crew in 
the role of leading YN onboard a submarine.
    b.  For E-6 and below Sailors, the following submarine ratings are open 
for conversion:  Sonar Technician, Fire Control Technician, Machinists Mate-
Weapons, Machinists Mate-Auxiliary, Missile Technician, ITS, Electronics 
Technician-Navigation (ETV), Electronics Technician-Communications, LS, CS, 
and YN.
    c.  The application process for E-6 and below nuclear-trained personnel 
will be announced by Chief of Naval Operations, Nuclear Propulsion Programs 
(OPNAV (N133)) and coordinated by the individual Sailor's command career 
counselor at the Nuclear Power Training Units (NPTU).  OPNAV (N133) will work 
with the NPTUs to establish application deadlines that maximize opportunity 
for selection.
Female junior staff instructors or Sailors in initial training at NPTU 
interested in volunteering for submarine duty should inform their chain of 
command as soon as possible in order to adequately manage their career 
timing.  Selections for nuclear-trained enlisted women will occur in the 
summer of 2018.

3.  Eligibility for Selection.  All Sailors, regardless of rating or rank, 
must meet the following minimum criteria to be eligible for
conversion:
    a.  Be a U.S. citizen already in possession of, or capable of receiving, 
a secret security clearance.
    b.  Meet Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) requirements 
for the desired rating(s) as outlined in reference (a).
    c.  Have no non-judicial punishments or convictions in civilian or 
military courts within the past 24 months.
    d.  Be medically screened and suitable for duty aboard a submarine per 
reference (b), chapter 15.  Further information regarding this requirement is 
provided in Note 2 of paragraph 4d below.

4.  Applications
    a.  All Sailors listed in paragraph 5 of reference (c) will automatically 
be considered for the next cycle of selections unless their original 
application was for cycle 1 as delineated in paragraph 5 of reference (d).  
Sailors who originally submitted a package for consideration in cycle 1 must 
resubmit if they desire consideration in cycle 3.  Interested Sailors are 
encouraged to contact the Submarine ECM (see paragraph 12 for contact 
information) to discuss ways to improve chances of selection and update their 
application.
    b.  Active-duty and Full Time Support (FTS) reserve duty Sailors must 
submit conversion packages directly to Military Community Management, 
Enlisted (BUPERS-32) for processing per paragraph 6 below.
    c.  The following is required for initial application  due by
1 April 2017:
        (1) Up to three submarine rating choices in order of preference;
        (2) Last three performance evaluations.  Sailors with minimal service 
and less than three evaluations are still eligible and should submit all 
evaluations on record;
        (3) Physical readiness information maintenance system data covering 
the last four years of physical fitness assessment information, as available;
        (4) ASVAB scores (E-6 and below only);
        (5) Official statement volunteering for submarine service as outlined 
in reference (e); and
        (6) CPO applicants are highly encouraged to submit a personal 
statement addressing their motivation for assignment to the Submarine Force 
and to clarify any potential issues with their official record.
    d.  Upon receiving the initial application, the submarine ECM will 
coordinate with the Sailor and her command to complete the below remaining 
items.  These items must be completed for selection eligibility not later 
than 1 May 2017 (see Note 1 below):
        (1) Enlisted Personnel Action Request (NAVPERS 1306/7) signed by the 
Sailor and the Sailors commanding officer (CO) that clearly states the 
recommended earliest and latest release dates from the current command and 
the Sailors top three submarine rating preferences.
        (2) CO recommendation letter (optional).
        (3) Completed submarine duty physical.  Interested candidates are 
encouraged to start this process as soon as possible following their decision 
to apply (see Note 2 below).
Note 1:  Sailors are encouraged to submit items listed in paragraph 4d above 
that are available at the time of initial submission and as soon as possible 
thereafter.
Note 2:  Due to the nature of submarine service, medical fitness for duty 
standards are stringent.  Candidates must have a current submarine duty 
physical approved by an undersea medical officer
(UMO) within 30 days of complete application submission not later than 1 May 
2017.  The Medical History Form (DD Form 2807-1) and Physical Examination 
Form (DD Form 2808) may be completed by any Department of Defense privileged 
provider.  However, a UMO is required to approve the overall submarine duty 
physical on DD Form 2808.  UMOs are located at all submarine homeport medical 
departments.  Contact numbers and locations of submarine homeport medical 
departments and UMOs:

    e.  Non-FTS reserve component Sailors will submit packages per reference 
(f).

6.  Applications must be scanned and delivered to the submarine non- nuclear 
ECM.  E-mail applications to aaron.norton(at)navy.mil; 
gregory.w.mosley(at)navy.mil; and jeremy.a.miller1(at)navy.mil.
     a.  An example package is available on the Naval Personnel Command 
website at:
http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/ewis/Pages/default.aspx or 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/enlisted/community/submarine/
pages/EnlistedWomeninSubmarines.aspx.
     b.  Applications are due by 1 April 2017 and the selection process will 
begin in May 2017.

7.  Following approval, primary and secondary selectees will be notified via 
naval message.  The target date for notifications of selectees is July 2017.  
Secondary selectees will be utilized in the event a primary selectee is 
unable to complete the submarine conversion.

8.  Prior to detailing selectees, Enlisted Submarine & Nuclear Assignments 
(PERS 403) will work with commands to minimize impact on the commands mission 
as the Sailor transitions to submarine service.

9.  Previous selection cycles valued Sailors with:
    a.  CO endorsement describing sustained superior performance;
    b.  Sea service experience;
    c.  Warfare qualification; and
    d.  Job experience (i.e. assignments that can be related to success in 
future submarine service).
Note:  Professional Apprentice Career Track Sailors and junior rated Sailors 
are encouraged to apply, even with limited time in service, no warfare 
qualification, or at-sea experience, since there is a requirement for female 
submarine Sailors at all pay grades.

10.  This round of selections only applies to the women scheduled to 
integrate the next submarine crews in 2018.  Subsequent NAVADMINs announcing 
follow-on submarine integrations will be released to commence future 
application cycles.  Opportunities for selection of enlisted women for 
assignment in submarines will be available approximately annually.

11.  In addition to this NAVADMIN, COMSUBLANT and COMSUBPAC will be 
conducting site visits to fleet concentration areas around the world to 
inform interested Sailors about career opportunities in the submarine force 
and to address any questions or concerns regarding the application or 
selection process.  The schedule for these engagements will be transmitted 
via separate correspondence and advertised on the Enlisted Women in 
Submarines website referenced in paragraph 2.

12.  For questions about the application process or about submarine service, 
contact the submarine non-nuclear ECM office:  LCDR Jeremy Miller, (901) 874-
2082/DSN 882; LT Gregory Mosley, (901) 874- 2081/DSN 882; YNC(SS) Aaron 
Norton, (901) 874-2819/DSN 882.
Nuclear-trained Sailors may contact the nuclear ECM office:  LCDR Christopher 
Carter, (703) 604-5493/DSN 664; ETNCM(SW) Jeremiah Ledda, (703) 604-5492/DSN 
664.

13.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
