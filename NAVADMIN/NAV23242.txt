completion of the obligated service from the first LCDR bonus and no 
later than 6 months after that date. 
    c.  References (b) and (c) limit career retention bonus payments 
to $300,000 for AC officers. 
 
4.  Program Eligibility 
    a.  LT EOD ORB: 
        (1) Unrestricted line (URL) officers (Designator 1140) who qualified 
EOD warfare officer by the completion of 6 YCS and EOD department head by 
eight YCS, awarded the additional qualification designators (AQD) of KG5 and 
KG0. 
        (2) Completed 6 years of commissioned service for the 4-year or 
initial 2-year bonus. 
(3) Completed 8 years of commissioned service for the second 2-year bonus. 
        (4) Completed any service commitment incurred in line with 
reference (e). 
        (5) Medically and physically qualified for assignment to sea duty. 
    b.  LCDR EOD ORB: 
        (1) URL officers (Designator 1140) that qualified EOD warfare officer 
and EOD department head, awarded the AQDs of KG5 and KG0. 
        (2) Completed 10 years of commissioned service or completion of the 
period of obligated service from any previous retention bonus. 
        (3) Medically and physically qualified for assignment to sea duty. 
    c.  Career Intermission Program (CIP).  An officer participating in CIP 
will be ineligible to receive ORB payments during the intermission 
period.  Payments will resume upon return to service and in line with the 
payment structure of the ORB agreement. 
 
5.  Program Execution 
    a.  The EOD Warfare OCM (BUPERS-311E) is assigned as the program manager 
and is delegated the authority to administer the EOD ORB program in line with 
applicable laws, Department of Defense directives and instructions, and this 
NAVADMIN. 
    b.  BUPERS-311E will receive applications submitted in the format 
referenced in paragraph 7 and is delegated the authority to: 
        (1) Evaluate the eligibility of EOD officers applying for the EOD 
ORB. 
        (2) Accept agreements to remain on Active Duty for the stated period 
in exchange for an EOD ORB. 
        (3) Administer ORB payments. 
    c.  All applications require written endorsement from the commanding 
officer of the applicant. 
    d.  Service Members will receive their initial bonus amount upon 
agreement acceptance and then in annual anniversary payments through the term 
of the agreement. 
    e.  Upon acceptance of an agreement by the program manager, the amount of 
the bonus becomes fixed and the officer will incur a firm service obligation. 
    f.  ORB requests for personnel who are being processed for officer 
designation removal or restoration will be held in abeyance, pending final 
resolution of the action in question. 
    g.  Annual LT ORB contract quotas will be based on LCDR requirements for 
the EOD officer community and special and incentive pay funding controls.   
Annual LCDR ORB contract quotas will be based on CDR requirements for the EOD 
officer community, as well as special and incentive pay funding controls.  If 
more officers apply than available funded contracts, the program manager and 
EOD community leadership will determine the approval criteria. 
    h.  All commanding officers (CO) shall encourage qualified officers to 
submit applications for EOD ORB and must endorse all requests in writing.   
Commands must ensure applications are accurate and verify applicants meet the 
eligibility requirements, including no pending actions which may render an 
applicant ineligible for the EOD ORB.  Application delays increase the 
likelihood that the community quotas will be met before an application is 
received. 
    i.  Officers under an ORB agreement are not eligible to apply for the 
Permanent Military Instructor (PMI) Program, or any redesignation program 
that results in a designator change to any designator other than 1140.  An 
officer under an ORB agreement may submit an application for PMI or any 
redesignation programs once the date of application is within 12 months of 
the final day of bonus obligation.

for this incentive or fail to complete the full period of additional

willful neglect, or not incurred during a period of unauthorized absence. 
        (2)  Separation from the naval service by operation of laws or 
regulations independent of misconduct. 
        (3)  Death (See subparagraph c below). 
        (4)  Where the Secretary of the Navy determines repayment would be 
against equity and good conscience or would be contrary to the best interests 
of the United States. 
    c.  For officers who die while serving under an EOD ORB service 
agreement, the remaining EOD ORB balance will be paid as a lump sum as part 
of the settlement of the final military pay account for the officer.  If 
death is determined to be the result of misconduct by the member, termination 
of future payments and recoupment of unearned portions of the bonus, as 
applicable, will be made in line with procedures established for Service 
Members whose inability to complete a contracted period of service is 
voluntary or the result of misconduct. 
 
9.  Additional guidance, information and updates regarding the EOD ORB are 
available at the MyNavy HR website.
