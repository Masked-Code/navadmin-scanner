selection ALNAV message to determine if they were selected for retention and

selection board via the letter to the board (LTB) rocess.  Reference (b) 
announced the introduction of a new application known as electronic 
submission of selection board documents (ESSBD), accessible through 
MNP.  ESSBD improves the speed, transparency and confidence of receipt over 
other LTB submission methods, such as hard copy and e-mail submitted letters 
and related attachments. 
    a.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to electronically 
submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without attachments and 
will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) exactly what will 
be delivered and presented to the board. 
    b.  To utilize ESSBD, candidates must access document services through 
MNP at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record.  On-screen instructions will 
direct the submitter thereafter. 
    c.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted.  If required, a full visual user 
guide is available at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-
promotion. 
    d.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command not later than 2359 
(central time zone) 10 days prior to the convening date of the respective 
board, as noted below.  Submitters are cautioned not to wait until the 
deadline date to submit LTBs via ESSBD or other available avenues.
