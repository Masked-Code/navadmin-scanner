RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces: 
    a.  PRIMS-2 will be available for the Calendar Year 2022 (CY2022) 
Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA). 
    b.  Revised forearm plank standards. 
    c.  Provides additional guidance for the CY2022 PFA. 
 
2.  PFA Cycle 2022.  The cycle will be conducted from 1 April to 30 September 
2022 in line with references (a) and (b).  All medically cleared Sailors will 
participate in all three fitness modalities (push-ups, forearm plank, cardio 
or alternate cardio) to determine their CY2022 PFA cycle overall score. 
Forearm planks will count for PFA score.  Physical Readiness Guides to 
include references (c) through (e) are located at: 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/21st-Century-Sailor/Physical-
Readiness/Guides/. 
    a.  The Physical Readiness Office will open the PFA Cycle 2022 in 
February 2022.  This PFA Cycle will be labeled PFA Cycle 1 2022 in PRIMS-2. 
    b.  Sailors will have access to physical readiness information through 
MyNavy Portal My Records and will electronically submit their Physical 
Activity Risk Factor Questionnaire (PARFQ) via MyNavy Portal upon their 
respective commands 10-week notification.  This is a change from the previous 
version of PRIMS. 
    c.  Revised Forearm Plank Standards. 
        (1) We learned from an analysis of 26,000 forearm plank records from 
the CY2021 PFA that Sailors performed well overall, there is a minor gender 
performance differential. 
        (2) As a result, we revised the forearm plank standards to be gender 
specific (i.e., separate male and female scoring tables) with a gradual age 
group stratification.  The Updated male and female forearm plank standards 
can be found in reference (d).  PFA calculators in both MyNavy Portal and the 
official PFA App are scheduled to be updated prior to 1 April 2022. 
    d.  Command Fitness Leaders (CFLs) and Assistant CFLs (ACFLs) guidance: 
        (1) CFL/ACFLs will enter PFA data into PRIMS-2 for the PFA Cycle 
2022. 
        (2) Prior to 1 April 2022, CFLs will be able to verify command 
rosters, assign members to departments and divisions, see commands reports 
and release/gain Sailors. 
        (3) On 1 April, CFL/ACFLs may enter scores into PRIMS-2.  CFL/ACFLs 
are prevented from entering scores until the PFA cycle commences. 
        (4) The number of ACFLs having access to PRIMS-2 for data entry will 
be limited based on command size (1 per 100 members due to licensing costs) 
and is different than the required number of ACFLs per command to effectively 
administer the PFA (1 per 25 members). 
        (5) CFLs should refer to reference (e) for detailed guidance. 
    e.  PRIMS-2 Training.  PRIMS-2 training will be offered bi-monthly for 
CFLs and ACFLs via Microsoft Teams.  Requests for training should be 
submitted to PRIMS(at)navy.mil.  Familiarization training materials are 
posted on the Physical Readiness program (PRP) website at: 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/21st-Century-Sailor/Physical-
Readiness/ and also available to back-end users (CFL, ACFL, and Special User) 
via PRIMS-2. 
    f.  Validation.  Sailors who meet the criteria for *validation* in PFA 
Cycle 1 2022 will be eligible for exemption from participation in the PRT 
portion of PFA Cycle 1 2023 provided Sailors meet Age Adjusted Standards for 
the Body Composition Assessment (BCA) (i.e. everyone needs to take the BCA). 
This validation is contingent upon the Navy conducting two PFA cycles in 
2023. 
    g.  COVID-19 Environment.  The PFA Cycle 1 2022 will be conducted using 
procedures outlined in reference (c) and based on local health protection 
conditions (HPCON).  CFLs will adhere to all local HPCON safety measures 
prior to execution of the PFA.
