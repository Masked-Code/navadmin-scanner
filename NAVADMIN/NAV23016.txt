Training and Administration of the Reserves (TAR) Officer Lieutenant 
Commander (LCDR) Retention and Continuation Selection Boards.  The TAR LCDR 
Retention and Continuation Selection Boards will convene, when required, 
immediately following the corresponding FY-24 Navy Reserve TAR Commander 
(CDR) Promotion Selection Boards. Eligible TAR LCDRs on the Reserve Active 
Status List (RASL) who are fully qualified to remain on active duty and meet 
the requirements in paragraph 3 will be considered for retention on active 
duty, and if required, continuation on the RASL. 
 
2.  Effect of Failure of Selection for Promotion.  A Navy TAR LCDR who twice 
failed of selection (2XFOS) for promotion to CDR and whose name is not on a

the limits of paragraph 3.e.  Officers released from active duty with less 
than 20 years of commissioned service (YCS) may request affiliation as a 
drilling reservist in the Selected Reserve (SELRES).  To affiliate as a

    b.  2XFOS LCDRs with 14-18 YOAS on the date of mandatory release from

from active duty with less than 20 YCS may request affiliation as a drilling

    c.  2XFOS LCDRs with 18-20 YOAS on the date of mandatory release from 
active duty under paragraph 2.  Retention Selection board action is not

the RASL beyond the last day of the month in which the officer completes 24 
YCS under section 14701 of title 10, U.S. Code or the last day of the month 
in which the officer becomes 62 years of age, whichever is earlier. 
 
4.  Reserve TAR Officers on the RASL who meet any of the criteria in 
paragraph 3 may check BUPERS Online, via MyNavy Portal at 
https://my.navy.mil/quick-links.html, after release of the respective 
selection ALNAV message, to determine if they were selected for retention and 
continuation.  Once logged into BUPERS Online, click on 
Advancements/Selection Boards and then on the appropriate officer 
(Promotion/Continuation) board to determine the results. 
 
5.  Promotion selection board convening dates are as follows: 
    a. Reserve TAR O-5 Line Promotion Selection Board convenes 7 March 2023. 
    b. Reserve TAR O-5 Staff Corps Promotion Selection Board convenes 28 
February 2023. 
 
6.  Correspondence addressed to the promotion selection board will not be 
forwarded to a subsequent retention and continuation board for 
consideration.  Officers must communicate with each board separately. 
 
7.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a retention and continuation 
selection board via the letter to the board (LTB) process.  NAVADMIN 220/19 
announced the introduction of a new application known as Electronic 
Submission of Selection Board Documents (ESSBD), accessible through 
BOL.  Electronic Submission of Selection Board Documents (ESSBD) improves the 
speed, transparency and confidence of receipt over other LTB submission 
methods, such as hard copy and e-mail submitted letters and related 
attachments. 
    a.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to 
electronically submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or 
without attachments, and will allow the candidate to see (for 
content and clarity) exactly what will be delivered and presented to 
the board. 
    b.  To utilize ESSBD, candidates must access document services 
through BOL at https://www.bol.navy.mil.  On-screen instructions will direct 
the submitter thereafter. 
    c.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted. 
    d.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command not later than 2359 
(central time zone) 10 days prior to the convening date of the respective 
board, as noted below.  Submitters are cautioned not to wait until the 
deadline date to submit LTBs via ESSBD or other available avenues. 
 
Selection Board             Convening Date        Due Date / Time

FTS Staff Ret/Cont Board      28 FEB 23         18 FEB 23 / 2359 CST 
 
    e.  If sending a board package from a non-NMCI network 
(bumed.mil, eu.navy.mil, etc.), please review procedures listed in 
NAVADMIN 220/19. 
    f.  The written communication may call attention to the board, any matter 
concerning the record of the officer the officer considers 
important.  Written communication may include, as enclosures, correspondence 
from any individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not 
originated by the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of 
the eligible officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must 
contain a written acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she 
desires such correspondence be presented to the board. 
Correspondence without such an acknowledgement is considered third party 
correspondence and will be returned without being presented to the 
board.  Classified correspondence will not be accepted. 
 
8.  Questions regarding LTB submission should be directed to MyNavy Career 
Center by calling 1-833-330-MNCC (1-833-330-6622/DSN: 882-6622). 
 
9. Questions regarding retention and continuation should be directed to Navy 
Personnel Command PERS-801 at (901) 874-4533/DSN 882.
