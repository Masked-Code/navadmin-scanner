RMKS/1.  2018 marks the start of a mid-term election year with numerous 
federal, state and local elections throughout the year.  Your right to vote 
is a freedom we defend and everyone is encouraged to exercise that right to 
ensure that their voice is heard.

2.  Policy.  In accordance with references (a) through (d), the Navy Voting 
Assistance Program will ensure that eligible voters receive information about 
registration and voting procedures and materials pertaining to scheduled 
elections, including dates, offices, constitutional amendments, and other 
ballot proposals.  The following guidance pertains to the Navy Voting 
Assistance Program:
    a.  To provide Sailors with a standardized point of contact for voting 
assistance, the Administrative Officer, whether military or Department of the 
Defense civilian employee (civil service or nonappropriated fund) will be 
designated in writing as the Voting Assistance Officer (VAO) at every command 
where a VAO is required.  Pursuant to reference (b), every Echelon 2 command, 
region, installation, commander, commanding officer, and officer-in charge of 
a command with more than 25 permanently assigned personnel must appoint a VAO 
who is responsible for maintaining a voting assistance program.
    b.  The Administrative Officer may delegate VAO duties, but remains 
responsible for command voting assistance program oversight.
    c.  VAOs must comply with the duties and responsibilities outlined in 
references (a) and (b).

3.  Commander, Navy Installations Command has updated every Region and 
Installation webpage and smartphone application under "Support Services" to 
add VAO location information as well as general links to key elements of the 
Federal Voting Assistance Program webpage www.fvap.gov.

4.  Updates to policies and instructions will be forthcoming. Contact the 
Navy Voting Action Officers, LT Kristin Hope and LT Coulter Heavenrich, with 
questions at vote(at)navy.mil or (202)433-4000.  Your leadership and 
engagement is critical to ensure our Sailors, civilians and their families 
have the opportunity to vote, regardless of their location or deployment 
status.
