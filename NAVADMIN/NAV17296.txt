3.  For promotion to the grade of lieutenant, an All-Fully-Qualified-Officers 
List (AFQOL) consisting of those officers recommended for promotion on their 
most recent fitness reports will be sent to the Secretary of the Navy, who 
will certify the AFQOL and forward the list to the Secretary of Defense.  
Those officers determined not fully qualified for promotion will be omitted 
from the AFQOL, constituting a Failure of Selection (FOS).  The All-Fully-
Qualified (AFQ) standard applies to all designators.  The AFQ standard will 
also be utilized for any officers administratively missed when the original 
lists were compiled.

4.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a promotion selection board.  
Correspondence must arrive not later than 10 calendar days before the 
convening date of the board and shall be addressed to:

    Navy Personnel Command (NPC) Customer Service Center
    President FY19 Navy Reserve, (Grade), (Line or Staff Corps, as
    applicable)
    Promotion Selection Board, Board #XXX, (Board number is a required field 
and may be found on the FY19 selection board schedule located at 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/selectionboardsupport/Pages/FY19-Board-Schedule.aspx
    5720 Integrity Drive, Millington, TN 38055-6300.

To check on receipt of your package, go to
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/reserveofficer/Pages/default.aspx and enter the customer service 
center link (check on your letter to the board) or contact the customer 
service center at (866)827-5672.  Written communication may invite to the 
attention of the board any matter concerning himself/herself that the officer 
considers important.  The written communication must be in accordance with 
MILPERSMAN 1420-010 and may include, as enclosures, correspondence from any 
individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not originated by 
the eligible officer, including endorsements to the officers letter, and 
letters written on behalf of that officer, must contain a written 
acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she desires that such 
correspondence be presented to the board. Correspondence without such 
acknowledgment is considered third party correspondence and will not be 
accepted.

5.  Officers in the grades of lieutenant (junior grade), lieutenant, 
lieutenant commander, and commander are eligible for consideration for 
promotion only if they have served continuously on either the
RASL or Active Duty List (ADL) (or a combination of both lists) during the 
one-year period ending on the date of the convening of the promotion board 
or, in the case of lieutenants (junior grade), the commencement of the AFQOL 
process.  Accordingly, officers returning to an active status from a period 
of inactive or broken service (USNR-S2, discharge) are eligible for 
consideration for promotion only after continuously serving in an active 
status for one full year.  Membership in the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) 
does not qualify for deferment of eligibility for consideration.

6.  All officers are reminded it is their responsibility to ensure their 
personnel records are substantially accurate and complete.
