RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides changes, effective immediately, to 
the reporting occasions of Command Master Chiefs (CMDCM) and Command 
Senior Chiefs (CMDCS) serving in the Active and Reserve Component. 
    a.  The Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (MCPON), Fleet 
Master Chiefs (FLTCM), Force Master Chiefs (FORCM), and CMDCMs who 
carry the 8CMC Navy enlisted classification code (NEC) and directly 
report to a flag or general officer will no longer receive periodic 
and detachment of individual reports. 
    b.  CMDCMs who carry the 8CMC NEC and do not directly report to 
a flag or general officer are only required to receive detachment of 
individual reports in line with reference (a). 
    c.  CMDCSs will now receive periodic reports ending on 15 
November and will continue to receive reports as required by 
reference (a). 
    d.  Chiefs of the Boat (COB) in the pay grade of E8 or E9 will 
continue to receive periodic reports ending on 15 September or 15 
April, respectively.  In occasions when a COB would be in the same 
summary group as other senior chiefs or master chiefs (for COBs that 
are an E9), the reporting senior may elect to adjust the COB's 
billet subcategory to SPECIAL01 in the billet subcategory block 
(Block 21) of the evaluation, separating them from the regular 
summary group. 
    e.  Source-rated master chiefs or senior chiefs who serve in 
senior enlisted leader roles (e.g., collateral duty positions) will 
continue to receive reports in line with reference (a). 
 
2.  Reporting seniors are encouraged to document deficiencies in 
performance or behavior in a special report. 
 
3.  Performance evaluation training materials, including the eNavFit 
user guide, video tutorials, best practices, and frequently asked 
questions are available on the NPC website at 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Performance-
Evaluation/eNAVFIT/.  The Performance Evaluation Transformation and 
eNavFit team will continue providing live training sessions via 
Microsoft Teams on a bi-monthly basis through Fiscal Year 2023. 
 
4.  For questions and concerns regarding these policy changes, 
contact FORCM Christian Detje at (901) 874-3030 or via e-mail at
