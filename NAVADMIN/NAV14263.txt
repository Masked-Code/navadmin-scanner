Rmks/1.  Suicide prevention is an all hands effort all the time.
Every life lost to suicide is one too many.  More than 50 percent of active-
duty Navy suicides are carried out with privately-owned firearms.  Research 
clearly indicates that reducing access to lethal means saves lives.  
Voluntary measures to reduce access to privately-owned firearms for any 
Sailor reasonably believed to be at risk for suicide or causing harm to 
others may prevent suicide or other unnecessary deaths in the Navy.

2.  As a general rule, the Department of Defense (DoD) does not prohibit the 
lawful acquisition, possession, ownership, carrying or other use of 
privately-owned firearms, ammunition, or other weapons on property other than 
that owned or operated by the DoD.  However, as the above law was modified, 
commanding officers and health professionals may inquire about, collect and 
record information about a service member*s privately-owned firearms, 
ammunition or other weapons if the commanding officer or health professional 
has reasonable grounds to believe the service member is at risk for suicide 
or causing harm to others.

3.  In implementing procedures in reference (a), the responsibilities of 
commanding officers to assess service member mental health issues and the 
responsibilities of health professionals to execute command notification 
requirements remain in effect as outlined in references (b) and (c).

4.  This policy governs voluntary storage and shall not be executed through 
coercion nor the use of incentives/disincentives.  Once a Sailor agrees to 
voluntarily relinquish a privately-owned firearm, the command shall follow 
the procedures outlined in reference (d) for proper safe storage of 
privately-owned firearms on an installation.  If a command is not located on 
an installation, the command should coordinate with local police, sheriff, 
National Guard or a Navy Operational Support Command for safekeeping; or the 
command shall store the firearm in an approved manner per reference (d).  If 
a predetermined storage period is not set between the commanding officer and 
the Sailor, the firearms shall be returned upon request.  The command must 
ensure that protected healthcare and personally identifiable information 
contained in any documentation is safeguarded per references (e) and (f).  
Commanding officers should consult the staff judge advocate or Navy Legal 
Service Office for legal advice.

5.  In all situations when there is an immediate risk to life, Navy personnel 
will take rapid action to ensure a Sailor receives necessary care and 
counseling to mitigate the risk of danger to the Sailor or others.

6.  Losing one Sailor to suicide is one Sailor too many.  This voluntary 
measure of reducing lethal means can save a Sailor from an irreversible 
decision and thus reduce suicide in our Navy.
Commanding officers and health professionals must be at the forefront of 
identifying those Sailors at risk and providing all available assistance.

7.  Point of contact for suicide prevention programs is CAPT Mike D.
Smith, OPNAV N171, at (901) 874-6635 or via e-mail at 
mike.d.smith1(at)navy.mil.  Point of contact for firearm storage is CDR 
Andrea Schreiber, OPNAV N4, at (703) 695-5526 or via e-mail at 
andrea.schreiber(at)navy.mil.

8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
