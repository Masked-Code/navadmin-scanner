SUBJ/ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AERIAL VEHICLE OPERATOR (AVO) WARRANT OFFICER (WO) 
COMMUNITY//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the establishment of the Aerial Vehicle 
Operator Warrant Officer (737X) community.

2.  In order to operate the MQ-25 Stingray, the first carrier-based, Unmanned 
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in the Navy, the Secretary of the Navy has approved the 
establishment of the AVO WO designator.  Unlike traditional Navy Chief 
Warrant Officers, 737X WO-1 will be accessed through Navy recruiting.  737X 
Warrant Officers will be trained as technical specialists in the operation of 
the MQ-25 platform.  In the future, 737X warrant officers may also be 
qualified to operate additional UAVs to support Navy requirements.

3.  Navy Recruiting Command will begin accepting applications for initial 
737X accessions beginning in FY22 in accordance with Program Authorization 
106A.  Selected candidates will attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in 
Newport, Rhode Island.  Upon completion of OCS, candidates will complete 
initial flight training with follow-on specialized training on the MQ-25 
platform.  Interested fleet applicants should contact their career counselors 
for additional information regarding the OCS application process.

4.  The procurement of the MQ-25 Stingray and the creation of the 737X AVO WO 
designator represent an exciting new chapter in the storied history of naval 
aviation.

5.  Points of contact are CAPT Christopher Wood, Aviation Officer Community 
Manager, (901) 874-3353/DSN 882 or email christopher.j.wood1(at)navy.mil and 
CWO5 Hector Sandoval, LDO/CWO Community Manager, (901) 874-2464/DSN 882 or 
email hector.sandoval(at)navy.mil.

6.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
