RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the solicitation of applications from highly 
qualified and motivated E-6 through E-9 personnel for the FY-18 Limited Duty 
Officer (LDO) and Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) Program.  LDOs and CWOs bring a 
variety of experience and unique perspectives into the wardroom from their 
enlisted service.  The LDO/CWO career paths provide additional leadership 
opportunities and enhance a Sailor's ability to contribute to the Navy.  
These programs deliver to the officer corps seasoned professionals with 
proven leadership abilities at an economical cost.  LDOs provide broad 
technical management and leadership skills, and CWOs provide specific 
technical expertise and leadership skills in support of the unrestricted 
line, restricted line, and staff corps communities. LDOs and CWOs serve in a 
variety of leadership billets within their technical fields, ranging from 
division officer to commanding officer (CO) ashore.

2.  Updated policy guidance to reference (a).
    a.  Non-nuclear applicants:  Time in service (TIS) eligibility 
requirements for FY-18 and beyond are 8-14 years of service for LDO and 14-20 
years of service for CWO.  TIS waivers of less than 8 years and greater than 
14 years will not be considered for LDO.  CWO waivers up to 22 years of 
service will be considered for master chief petty officers only.
    b.  Nuclear applicants:  Refer to paragraph 11 of this message for 
eligibility requirements.

3.  The FY-18 Active-Duty LDO/CWO In-Service Procurement Board will convene 
at a date to be determined in January 2017.  For the most current board 
dates, visit the Navy Personnel Command (NPC) board webpage at 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/selectionboardsupport/pages/default2.aspx and select "FY-18 board

October 2016.  Routine addendums to applications, excluding evaluations and 
awards, must be received no later than 1 December 2016.  Evaluations and

received that is not under the applicant's cover letter (e.g., third party 
correspondence) and endorsed by the command, or not postmarked or received at 
NPCs Customer Service Center (CSC) by the established deadline(s) will not be 
presented to the board.  The time and date (central standard time) received 
in the NPC CSC inbox is the time and date used for deadline verification.  
Although a late submission may be accepted by the NPC CSC, it will not be 
presented to the board.  All applications/addendums must have the service 
member's full social security number on each page.  The preferred method of

7.  Applicants must ensure copies of their most recent periodic evaluations

9.  Non-nuclear CWO applicants for LDO must have at least 2 years TIG and be 
between 14 and 16 years total active service as of 1 October 2017.  This

will terminate their CWO status and become a permanent LDO upon appointment.

10.  As a result of the LDO/CWO sustainability initiative, applications will 
not be accepted for the following non-nuclear active-duty designators:  615X, 
621X, 647X, 655X, 680X, 7211, 7231, 7281, 7481, 749X, 7511, and 7531.

11.  The following guidance applies to nuclear-trained personnel:

Nuclear-trained LDO applicants with TIS greater than 14 years, but less than 
16 years may submit a waiver using Enlisted Personnel Action Request (NAVPERS 
1306/7 Rev 01-03) to the Nuclear Propulsion Program Manager (OPNAV (N133)) 
via Enlisted Nuclear/Submarine Assignment (PERS-403).  Waivers for TIS 
greater than 16 years will not be considered.
    b.  Nuclear-trained personnel are reminded of the requirement to obtain a 
conditional release from nuclear field duty per reference
(b), prior to submitting an application for any officer commissioning 
program.
    c.  Applications will not be accepted for nuclear CWO designators (740X).
    d.  Nuclear designated LDO selectees who do not successfully complete a 
final technical interview will maintain their enlisted status and not be 
commissioned as Limited Duty Officers.  Technical interviews will be 
scheduled by Nuclear Placement and Assignments PERS-422 and selectees will be 
notified via separate correspondence.

12.  The FY-18 board will consider applicants for cyber chief warrant 
officers (784X).  Personnel applying for this designator must meet

documented technical and leadership experience in their enlisted service 
records, regardless of current rating.  However, special attention should be 
given to the guidance in paragraph 9c of reference (a).

16.  Applicants must maintain eligibility throughout the selection and 
promotion process.  Applicants who are deemed ineligible after the submission 
of applications must be declared ineligible by their current COs/OICs.  A 
sample format is located at http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/administrative/ldo_cwo/Pages/default.aspx.

17.  Each applicant and command must ensure applications are complete and 
accurate.  Incomplete applications could result in non-selection.  Refer to 
reference (a), (chapters 2, 7 and appendix f) for program overview, 
eligibility criteria, and application format.

18.  CO/OIC endorsement, located on page 10 of OPNAV 1420/1 (Rev 01-08), must 
contain the following statement:  "Applicant meets all requirements outlined 
in OPNAVINST 1420.1B, NAVADMIN XXX/16 (use the NAVADMIN # for this message),
