PROCESS.  REF B IS NAVADMIN 297/09, POST DEPLOYMENT HEALTH RE-
ASSESSMENT UPDATE.  REF C IS BUMED INSTRUCTION 6110.14, DOCUMENTING AND 
REPORTING INDIVIDUAL MEDICAL READINESS DATA.//

RMKS/1.  POST-DEPLOYMENT HEALTH RE-ASSESSMENTS (PDHRA) ARE CRITICAL TO 
THE WELL BEING OF OUR FORCE, AND WE CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR PROCESSES TO 
ENSURE PDHRA COMPLETION.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES A SOFTWARE UPDATE TO 
THE MEDICAL READINESS REPORTING SYSTEM (MRRS) THAT DOES NOT ALLOW A 
PERIODIC HEALTH ASSESSMENT (PHA) TO BE MARKED COMPLETE IN THE EVENT THE 
MEMBER HAS AN OVERDUE POST DEPLOYMENT HEALTH RE-ASSESSMENT (PDHRA) 
REQUIREMENT.

2.  THE PDHRA WAS CREATED TO IDENTIFY DEPLOYMENT-RELATED PHYSICAL AND 
PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY APPEAR AFTER 
RETURNING FROM A RIGOROUS DEPLOYMENT.  THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE ALL OF 
OUR SHIPMATES RECEIVE THESE ASSESSMENTS AND THE SUPPORT THEY DESERVE IS 
FOR OUR NAVY TO REACH OUR GOAL OF 100 PERCENT PDHRA COMPLIANCE.  
COMMAND AND UNIT LEADERSHIP ATTENTION TO THIS VITAL ISSUE IS BOTH 
NECESSARY AND APPRECIATED.  WE HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES TO INCREASE 
PDHRA COMPLIANCE RATES FROM 80 PERCENT IN OCTOBER 2009 TO MORE THAN 90 
PERCENT IN MAY 2010.  CONTINUED COMMAND LEADERSHIP INVOLVEMENT IS 
ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE PDHRAS ARE EXPEDITIOUSLY COMPLETED AND TO ENCOURAGE 
OPENNESS AND HONESTY WITHOUT FEAR OF CAREER OR SOCIAL REPERCUSSIONS.
