SUBJ/UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS BIRTHDAY 2011//

RMKS/1.   ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY, HAPPY 236TH BIRTHDAY
TO THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS!

2.  ON THE 10TH OF NOVEMBER, WE CAN REFLECT WITH PRIDE ON MORE THAN TWO 
CENTURIES OF WARFIGHTING EXCELLENCE ALONGSIDE OUR PRIMARY JOINT PARTNER.  
THOUGH MUCH IN THE WORLD HAS CHANGED SINCE 1775, THE TRULY IMPORTANT THINGS 
STAND FAST, SUCH AS NAVY-MARINE CORPS PARTNERSHIP.
AS IT DID IN 1775, OUR PARTNERSHIP TODAY FOCUSES ON WARFIGHTING FIRST AND 
OPERATING FORWARD TOGETHER, ENSURING THE SECURITY AND STABILITY OF MARITIME 
CROSSROADS AROUND THE WORLD.  AS NAVY COMMITS TO ALWAYS "BE READY," WE KNOW 
THE FIGHTING SPIRIT AND PROFESSIONALISM OF THE MARINE CORPS WILL FOREVER BE 
WITH US, TO GUARANTEE VICTORY, AND TO CONFRONT THE THREATS AND CHALLENGES OF 
AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE.

3.  AS WE MARK THIS JOYOUS OCCASION, LET US REMEMBER THOSE MARINES WHO HAVE 
GIVEN THE LAST, FULL MEASURE OF DEVOTION.  BY MAKING THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE, 
THEY FORGED THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE NAVY-MARINE CORPS TEAM AND MADE POSSIBLE 
OUR SERVICE TODAY.

4.  THE MARINE CORPS CARRIES A PROUD LEGACY WHEREVER YOU GO.  THE NAVY IS 
HONORED AND PRIVILEGED TO SERVE BESIDE YOU.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU, AND TO 
YOUR FAMILIES.

5.  ADMIRAL GREENERT, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
