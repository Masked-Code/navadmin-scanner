RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ESTABLISHES A FORMAL POLICY FOR THE DISPOSITION OF 
REJECTED PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS.  EACH YEAR, COMMANDS SUBMIT APPROXIMATLEY 
70K INVALID PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS WHICH MUST BE RETURNED AND CORRECTED.  
WHEN REPORTS ARE RETURNED BY NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (NAVPERSCOM) FOR 
CORRECTION NEARLY 20 PERCENT ARE NOT RESUBMITTED OR RESUBMITTED AFTER 
SIGNIFICANT DELAY BY COMMANDS.  CONSEQUENTLY, SAILORS/OFFICERS HAVE LITTLE 
RECOURSE TO UPDATE AND MAINTAIN ACCURATE OFFICIAL MILITARY PERSONNEL FILES 
(OMPF).  AS A RESULT, AFFECTED PERSONNEL ARE LEFT WITH AN INCOMPLETE 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION HISTORY THAT MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THEIR CAREERS.

2.  EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, NAVPERSCOM WILL USE THE FOLLOWING DISPOSITION 
GUIDELINES TO PROCESS INVALID PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS:
    A.  ACCEPT A REJECTED PERFORMANCE EVALUATION TO THE OMPF ?AS IS? WHEN A 
COMMAND FAILS TO RESPOND TO REJECT NOTIFICATION AFTER 180 DAYS.  (EXCEPTION:  
UNSIGNED ADVERSE REPORTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED).
    B.  WHEN AN ENS OR LTJG (NON-LDO) RECEIVES A MUST OR EARLY PROMOTE 
RECOMMENDATION, NAVPERSCOM WILL CHANGE THE RECOMMENDATION TO PROMOTABLE PER 
REF A GUIDELINES.
    C.  DOCUMENT THE REJECT REASON AND THE NON-RESPONSE FROM THE COMMAND BY 
PLACING A MEMORANDUM ALONGSIDE THE EVALUATION IN THE OMPF.
    D.  UPDATE THE MAINFRAME TO REFLECT THE MEMORANDUM ACTION AS SUPPLEMENTAL 
DATA.
    E.  STAMP CORRECTED EVALUATIONS RECEIVED AFTER DISPOSITION (SUBMITTED 
AFTER 180 DAYS) ?CORRECTED REPORT RECEIVED DDMMYYY? AND PLACE IN THE OMPF 
ALONGSIDE ANY PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED DOCUMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REJECTED 
EVALUATION.

3.  WHILE ULTIMATE RECORD ACCURACY RESTS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL, THE CHAIN OF 
COMMAND ALSO SHARES RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE TIMELY AND ACCURATE PERFORMANCE 
EVALUATIONS ARE SUBMITTED.  REPORTING SENIORS AND INDIVIDUALS CAN TRACK THE 
STATUS OF SUBMITTED PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS USING BUPERS ON LINE (BOL) AT 
HTTPS://WWW.BOL.NAVY.MIL.  IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUALS MAY VIEW THEIR COMPLETE 
RECORDS BY EITHER USING WEB ENABLED RECORD REVIEW (WERR) OR BY ORDERING A CD.
