SUBJ/2013 NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY// 

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces 20 September 2013 as the National Prisoner 
of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) Recognition Day.  
National POW/MIA Recognition Day is a national day of observance for 
Americans to offer remembrance, honor, and reverence to those who were a POW 
and to those who remain MIA from our nation's wars.  It is also a day to 
remember the POW/MIA families and the sacrifices they have endured.

2.  To commemorate this event, the President of the United States is expected 
to issue a presidential proclamation designating 20 September 2013 as 
National POW/MIA Recognition Day.  

3.  There are more than 83,000 American service members missing from WWII 
through the Persian Gulf War.  Of these service members, Navy has over 33,000 
unaccounted for Sailors.  These MIA loss incidents include WWII, USS 
Oklahoma, and Pearl Harbor which resulted in Sailors buried as unknowns in 
the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, and two naval aviators still 
unaccounted-for from the Persian Gulf War.  

4.  "Keeping the promise" is the theme established by the Department of 
Defense for this year's POW/MIA Recognition Day.  This theme emphasizes the 
promise of our nation to continue to search for our heroes who are still 
missing from past conflicts.  Recently, the remains of two Vietnam War MIA 
Sailors were identified and their remains were returned to loved ones for 
burial in our homeland. 

5.  Navy commands are encouraged to host or support local National POW/MIA 
Recognition Day activities.  Activities can range from displaying the missing 
man table in work spaces to more formal ceremonies where a former POW or a 
family member of a current MIA Sailor could be a guest speaker. 

6.  The Department of Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) is the U.S. 
government agency that leads the effort to account for missing service 
members.  For more information on this effort and National POW/MIA 
Recognition Day please visit DPMO web site at http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/.  
Also visit the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command website for information on 
recovery and identification 
efforts of missing service members at http://www.jpac.pacom.mil/.     

7.  Additionally, pursuant to section 902 of Title 36, U.S. Code, National 
POW/MIA Recognition Day is one of six official days the POW/MIA flag is 
required to be publically displayed with the United States flag at federal 
facilities.

8.  For information on specific Navy MIA loss incidents to highlight at 
command activities or other POW/MIA information to aid in hosting such 
activities, please contact the Navy POW/MIA branch via e-mail at 
mill_navypow-mia(at)navy.mil or 1-800-443-9298.
