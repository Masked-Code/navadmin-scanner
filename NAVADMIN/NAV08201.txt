OF DEFENSE DIRECTIVE-TYPE MEMORANDUM - DOD SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER 
REDUCTION PLAN.// RMKS/1.  THE SYSTEM USED TO STORE AND MANAGE OFFICIAL 
MILITARY PERSONNEL FILES AND SUPPORT SELECTION BOARDS USES THE MEMBER'S 
FULL SSN AS THE MILITARY PERSONNEL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (PER REFS A 
AND B).  THE FULL SSN IS JUSTIFIED AS AN OPERATIONAL NECESSITY TO 
REDUCE THE UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF RISK OF IMPROPERLY IDENTIFYING THE 
INCORRECT OMPF IN EMPRS AND MEETS THE WAIVER REQUIREMENTS OF REF C.
NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND ELECTRONICALLY REDACTS THE REPORTING SENIOR SSN 
IN FITNESS REPORTS AND EVALUATIONS PRIOR TO PLACING THE REPORT IN THE 
OMPF.  
2.  NAVY IS WORKING TO ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT FOR SSN SUBMITTAL 
UNDER THE DEFENSE INTEGRATED MILITARY HUMAN RESOURCE SYSTEM (DIHMHRS) 
PROGRAM.  UNTIL THAT SYSTEM IS INTRODUCED, AND TO ENSURE THE CORRECT 
FILING OF REPORTS, OMPF DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED WITHOUT THE FULL SSN ARE 
RETURNED TO THE ORIGINATING COMMAND FOR RESUBMISSION WITH THE FULL SSN.  
3.  POINTS OF CONTACT: 
- FOR OMPF DOCUMENTS IS MR. JAMES LAUDERMILK, PERS-312E, AT (901) 874-
