FEDERAL AND STATE TAX RETURNS.
A. VOLUNTEERS ASSIST SAILORS AND DEPENDENTS AT NO COST.

OCONUS TAX CENTERS.

6. TAX ASSISTANCE CENTERS DEPEND ON LOCAL COMMANDS FOR PERSONNEL, EQUIPMENT, 
AND FACILITIES. THIS PROGRAM MERITS SERIOUS CONSIDERATION IN EVERY COMMAND'S 
ALLOCATION OF MANPOWER AND RESOURCES AND IS A PARTICULARLY GOOD USE OF 
TALENTED LIMITED DUTY SAILORS.

FULL OR PART-TIME AT TAX CENTERS.
