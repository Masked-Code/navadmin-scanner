RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and provides additional guidance 
regarding the type of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) authorized in 
FLANK SPEED Microsoft Office 365 (M365).  Users must be vigilant as CUI is 
not allowed on non-government devices (i.e. personal desktop and laptop 
computers, tablets, and mobile phones).
2.  Key definitions (from references (b) and (c)):
    a.  CUI.  UNCLASSIFIED information the Government creates or possesses, 
or that an entity creates or possesses for or on behalf of the Government, 
that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires or permits an 
agency to handle using safeguarding or dissemination controls, but does not 
meet the requirements for classification per Executive Order 13526 or the 
Atomic Energy Act.
    b.  Legacy for Official Use Only (FOUO).  Prior to the CUI program, this 
was a dissemination control marking applied to unclassified information that 
disclosure to the public of that particular Record, or portion thereof, would 
reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected 
by one or more Exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  FOUO 
information does not automatically become CUI and is not interchangeable with 
CUI.
        (1) Legacy FOUO material is not required to be re-marked or redacted 
while it remains under Department of Defense (DoD) control or is accessed 
online and downloaded for use within the DoD.
        (2) Legacy FOUO material or new derivative documents must be marked 
as CUI if the information qualifies as CUI, particularly if it is being 
shared with other government departments.
    c.  DoD CUI Registry.  Provides an official list of Categories used to 
identify the various types of CUI.  Individuals must use the DoD CUI registry 
to ensure proper identification of all CUI material.  The registry is located
at: https://www.dodcui.mil/Home/DoD-CUI-Registry.
    d.  Authorized Holders.  Individuals that designate or handle CUI and are 
responsible for determining, at the time of creation, whether information in 
a document falls into a CUI category.  If so, the authorized holder is 
responsible for applying CUI markings and dissemination instructions 
accordingly, in accordance with reference (b) and (c).
    e.  Lawful Government Purpose.  Any activity, mission, function, 
operation, or endeavor that the U.S. Government authorizes or recognizes as 
within the scope of its legal authorities or the legal authorities of non-
executive branch entities (such as state and local law enforcement).
    f.  Limited Dissemination Controls (LDC).  Any control used to limit or 
specify CUI dissemination.
        (1) Only Authorized Holders can apply this additional marking and 
will only be used to promote a Lawful Government Purpose.
        (2) All LDCs must be approved by the CUI Executive Agent (EA) listed 
in the CUI Registry (for example, CUI marked FED ONLY further restricts 
sharing to Federal Employees; CUI marked NOCON prohibits sharing with 
Contractors).  Lawful Government Purpose requires that Authorized Holders of 
CUI must not share CUI where sharing is prohibited, restricted, or further 
subject to LDCs.
3.  General CUI Guidelines.
    a.  The FLANK SPEED Authority to Operate permits processing and storage 
of CUI data types, as listed in reference (b), up to moderate impact 
Personally Identifiable Information (PII).  All policies for handling 
permitted CUI data types still apply.
        (1) The following data types are not yet authorized on FLANK SPEED:
            (a) Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
information, to include Protected Health Information
            (b) Navy Nuclear Propulsion Information (NNPI)
            (c) Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data
        (2) Authorization for above listed data types is planned as part of 
future capability releases.  Users will be notified when these data types are 
authorized.
        (3) Users are responsible for verifying with their Information System 
Security Manager (ISSM) and Command Security Manager (CSM) the permitted CUI 
data types authorized on the network(s) they are using.
    b.  Organizations and all Navy military, civilian, and contractor 
personnel are responsible for following the guidelines outlined in references 
(b) and (c) for handling and protecting CUI.
    c.  Per references (b) and (c), personnel will not use unofficial or 
personal (e.g., .net, .com, etc.) e-mail accounts, messaging systems, or 
other non-DoD information systems to conduct official business involving CUI.
    d.  Approved/authorized government contractor systems are permitted to 
handle CUI.
    e.  Access to CUI is based on whether the individual has a Lawful 
Government Purpose.  While similar to Need to Know for classified 
information, Lawful Government Purpose has a different litmus test.  See 
reference (b) for guidance on Lawful Government Purpose.
4.  Training.  All personnel (military, civilian, and contractor) who are 
authorized access to classified information systems must receive initial and 
annual refresher CUI education and training.  The Center for Development of 
Security Excellence (CDSE), an element of the Defense Counterintelligence and 
Security Agency (DCSA), has developed and released the only authorized and 
approved DoD CUI training module.  The training module is accessed at 
https://www.dodcui.mil/Home/Training/.  When accessing the website, click on 
the CDSE Current CUI link to access the training and resource materials.
