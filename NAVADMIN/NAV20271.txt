cscselboard(at)navy.mil.  This is still a valid e-mail address for MyNavy 
Career Center (MNCC).  E-mailed LTBs must be encrypted to protect personally 
identifiable information.

communication errors that prevent the MNCC from reading a submission do not 
justify a late LTB.  To verify receipt of a LTB, go to

Although late or unsigned LTBs may be accepted by the MNCC, they will not be
