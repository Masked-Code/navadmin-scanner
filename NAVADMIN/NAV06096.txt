GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THE NAVY'S EXPANDING ROLE IN GWOT PLACES AN
INCREASINGLY HIGH DEMAND FOR MASTER-AT-ARMS (MA) PERSONNEL
WORLDWIDE.  IN RECENT MONTHS A DISTURBING TREND OF INCREASING
OVERSEAS SCREENING FAILURES HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN THIS RATING.  SINCE
JUN 05, 152 HAVE FAILED FOR VARIOUS REASONS:  49 HAD MEDICAL/DENTAL
ISSUES, 29 HAD PFA FAILURES, 27 FAILED TO OBLISERVE, 25 HAD SECURITY
CLEARANCE ISSUES, AND 22 HAD LEGAL/FINANCIAL ISSUES.  I NEED YOUR
HELP TO BRING THIS RATING BACK TO THE LEVEL OF READINESS NEEDED TO
MEET OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
2.  ACCORDINGLY, ALL COMMANDS ARE TO CARRY OUT THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS
BY 30 MAY 06:
    A.  PHYSICAL READINESS:  USING THE RESULTS OF THE LAST
SEMI-ANNUAL PFA ADMINISTERED, ENSURE ALL MA PERSONNEL ARE WITHIN
PHYSICAL READINESS STANDARDS PER OPNAVINST 6110.1H.  REPORT ALL WHO
ARE NOT WITHIN PHYSICAL READINESS STANDARDS USING THE PROCEDURE IN
PARAGRAPH 3 BELOW AND DESCRIBE MEASURES BEING TAKEN TO CORRECT THE
DEFICIENCY.
    B.  SECURITY CLEARANCE:  ENSURE THAT ALL MA PERSONNEL POSSESS A
DONCAF ADJUDICATED SECRET CLEARANCE ELIGIBILITY PER SECNAVINST
5510.30.  IF MEMBER POSSESSES CURRENT ELIGIBILITY, COMMAND SECURITY
MANAGERS ARE REQUIRED TO ANNOTATE ACCESS IN THE JOINT PERSONNEL
ADJUDICATION SYSTEM.  PARAGRAPH 3 BELOW IDENTIFIES REPORTING
REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE MEMBERS WHO HAVE HAD CLEARANCE ELIGIBILITY
DENIED OR REVOKED.  PARAGRAPH 4 BELOW PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION
NECESSARY WHEN CLEARANCE ELIGIBILITY HAS BEEN DENIED OR REVOKED.
    C.  MEDICAL/DENTAL:  ENSURE ALL MA PERSONNEL HAVE A CURRENT
PERIODIC HEALTH ASSESSMENT (PHA) PER OPNAVINST 6120.3.  ENSURE
MEDICAL AND DENTAL READINESS ISSUES ARE PROPERLY DOCUMENTED.  IF
LONG-STANDING, UNRESOLVABLE ISSUES EXIST THAT WOULD PREVENT MEMBER
FROM SCREENING FOR REMOTE/UNACCOMPANIED/OVERSEAS ASSIGNMENT, REPORT
USING THE PROCEDURES IN PARAGRAPH 3 BELOW.
    D.  OTHER:  USING MILPERSMAN 1300-304 AS A GUIDE, REVIEW WITH
ALL MA'S THE REQUIREMENTS FOR REMOTE/UNACCOMPANIED/OVERSEAS
ASSIGNMENT (REVIEWING ITEMS APPLICABLE TO MEMBER ONLY, NOT FAMILY).
IF LONG-STANDING, UNRESOLVABLE ISSUES EXIST THAT WOULD PREVENT
MEMBER FROM SCREENING FOR REMOTE/UNACCOMPANIED/OVERSEAS ASSIGNMENT,
REPORT THE SPECIFIC ISSUES AND DEFICIENCIES USING THE PROCEDURES IN
PARAGRAPH 3 BELOW.
3.  COMMANDS MUST SCREEN ALL MA PERSONNEL AND REPORT COMPLETION OF
SCREENING AND IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES VIA NAVAL MESSAGE BY 30 MAY 06
