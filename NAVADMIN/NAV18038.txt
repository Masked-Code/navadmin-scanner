RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN is the first in a series of messages aimed at 
communicating to commands, Navy and Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) 
stakeholders, and NMCI end-users Department of the Navy plans for enterprise 
migration to Windows 10 (WIN10) Secure Host Baseline (SHB).  This migration 
represents significant change to information systems that support day to day 
operations across the Navy, and will require the direct engagement and 
support of leadership at every echelon to be successful.  Leaders are 
expected to ensure that all personnel understand and execute their individual 
responsibilities, and raise any issues to the appropriate implementation team 
early to ensure minimal impact to operations.

2.  Per references (a) and (b), the Navy has started the deployment of the 
WIN10 SHB operating system with a target completion date of June 2018 to the 
NMCI Enterprise.  For OCONUS Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-Net) users, WIN10 
SHB migrations are underway.  OCONUS enterprise deployment is being 
coordinated through respective Theater Network Operations and Security 
Centers (TNOSCs) for each region.  The deployment of the WIN10 Operating 
System is necessary comply with DoD mandates, improve cyber security, and 
promote standardization across the Naval Enterprise Network (NEN).

3.  The Navy is deploying WIN10 to NMCI through three different methods to 
meet the June 2018 target completion date.
    a.	Seat Technical Refresh:  New machines with WIN10 pre-loaded will 
be delivered as part of tech refresh.  The NMCI Contract Technical 
Representative (CTR) coordinates the replacement of machines directly with 
the user.  User data is automatically transferred as part of the technical 
refresh process.
    b.	In-Place Upgrade (IPU):  This is an automated push of the WIN10 
SHB software package to each user seat.  NMCI CTRs will ensure each user is 
notified of their install date, and automated notifications will also be 
presented on each workstation beginning seven (7) days prior to the install 
date.
        (1) Though not required, it is recommended every user backup their 
files on the C: drive and desktop by moving the files to the user profile 
drive (H: drive) or other appropriate back up location no later than two days 
before the installation is scheduled to start.
        (2) The files on the computer will start decrypting two (2) days 
before the WIN10 install is scheduled to begin.  Users will see a pop-up 
message stating that decryption has started.  Decryption runs in the 
background and you can continue working. IMPORTANT:  Do not power down or 
remove the computer from the network once this process has started until the 
entire WIN10 installation has been completed.
        (3) Users should not cancel or stop the WIN10 upgrade process, as 
this may severely impact computer performance and result in data loss.
        (4) More detailed instructions will be provided of what users can 
expect to see through the migration process through user communiques.
    c.	Manual Re-Image process:  This is a Full Hard Drive Wipe and 
Reload with WIN10 SHB by the DXC Field Services team and/or PMW-205s Re-Image 
Augmentation team using DVDs.  This process may take from 24 to 36 hours to 
complete.  Users will be notified if this process applies to their computer, 
and will be provided instructions regarding the actions required to prepare 
for the upgrade.  It is the responsibility of every user to ensure any files 
saved on the local C: drive or the desktop are moved to the user profile 
drive (H: drive) a few days before the installation is scheduled.  If the 
files size exceeds available H: drive space, users should contact their local 
Information Systems Technician support for individual guidance.

4.  Users must be vigilant of user bulletins as the deployment schedule can 
change.  Close coordination with the CTR and properly backing up data on a 
regular basis is important as the WIN10 deployment starts.  Users should 
report issues following deployment directly to the NMCI Help Desk at 1-866-
THE-NMCI.

5.  WIN10 brings a new look and feel to the user interface with many 
enhancements and greater collaboration capabilities.  Specifically, WIN10 SHB 
will enhance the user interface and set the stage for future unified 
communications capabilities such as chat, desktop conferencing, collaboration 
tools, and voice over internet protocol (VOIP).  The WIN10 SHB deployment 
also includes an upgrade to Microsoft Office 2016 and the installation of a 
fourth web browser, Microsoft Edge, to improve user experience by 
implementing similar capabilities found on personally-owned devices.  As this 
is a significant departure from the current Windows 7 environment, users are 
highly encouraged to take the below courses in preparation for migration.

        (2) Microsoft Office 2016 to learn more about the Microsoft (MS)
Word, MS PowerPoint, MS Excel:

    b.	Skillport is an NMCI E-Learning system designed to increase user 
comfort and proficiency with NMCI tools and capabilities. Specific 
recommended courses to support WIN10 migration include:
        (1) Computing skills for WIN10
        (2) Email (MS Outlook) Outlook 2016
        (3) Office 2016 applications (MS Word, Excel, Access, and PowerPoint)

6.  Any operational concerns with the aforementioned process (applications 
not compatible with WIN10) an implementation should be communicated to your 
echelon II CIO/N6.  Echelon II CIO/N6 requesting to delay a WIN10 update must 
provide U.S. Fleet Cyber Command Battle Watch Center operational impact and 
justification.

Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
