SUBJ/NAVY UNIFORM UPDATE - SERVICE DRESS KHAKI// 
REF/A/DOC/NAVPERS 15665I/01JAN2003/ 
NARR/REF A IS U.S. NAVY UNIFORM REGULATIONS.// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE APPROVAL FOR FINAL DEVELOPMENT OF 
SERVICE DRESS KHAKI (SDK) AS AN OPTIONAL UNIFORM, AND PROVIDES INITIAL 
DETAILS OF OCCASION FOR WEAR POLICY.
2.  SDK WEAR TEST BEGAN IN APRIL 2008 AND COMPLETED IN OCTOBER 2009.  
125 SAILORS PARTICIPATED IN THE WEAR TEST IN SIX GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS.  
TWO WEAR TEST DESIGNS WERE EVALUATED.  THE FIRST, A TRADITIONAL DESIGN, 
WAS BASED ON THE ORIGINAL SDK UNIFORM DISESTABLISHED IN 1975.  THE 
SECOND, A CONTEMPORARY DESIGN, INCORPORATED MORE UPDATED DESIGN 
FEATURES SUCH AS AN UNBELTED WAIST AND PEAKED LAPELS.  BASED ON 
FEEDBACK PROVIDED IN WRITTEN SURVEYS AND FOCUS GROUPS, THE CLEAR 
PREFERENCE OF WEAR TEST PARTICIPANTS WAS THE CONTEMPORARY DESIGN 
UNIFORM.  THE PARTICIPANTS PROVIDED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER SDK 
UNIFORM COMPONENT MODIFICATIONS.  NEXCOM WILL PURSUE A
75/25 POLY/WOOL FABRIC BLEND JACKET, SUCH THAT IT MAY BE WORN WITH THE 
EXISTING SERVICE KHAKI PANTS OR SKIRT.  
3.  WE ANTICIPATE THE UNIFORM WILL BE AVAILABLE BY FY 2012.  SDK WILL 
BE FOR OPTIONAL WEAR BY E7 THROUGH O10 IN LIEU OF SUMMER WHITE AND 
SERVICE KHAKI DURING PERIODS WHEN SUMMER UNIFORMS ARE PRESCRIBED, AND 
DURING SITUATIONS WHERE WEARING A TIE IS APPROPRIATE, SUCH AS AN OFFICE 
ENVIRONMENT.  AS SUCH, IT WILL SERVE AS AN OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION OF 
SERVICE KHAKI (LONG SLEEVE SHIRT AND TIE, WITH OR WITHOUT JACKET).  
DETAILED REGULATIONS FOR WEAR WILL BE PROMULGATED AT A LATER DATE, 
CONSISTENT WITH ART 1201 OF REF A.
4.  NEXCOM ANTICIPATES A PERIOD OF 18 MONTHS TO COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT OF 
SDK AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE.  
ONCE AVAILABLE, SDK WILL BE SOLD VIA SPECIAL ORDER FROM NAVY EXCHANGE 
SERVICE COMMAND (NEXCOM) UNIFORM CENTERS.  
BECAUSE IT WILL BE AN OPTIONAL UNIFORM, THE COST TO OWN WILL BE THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND NO UNIFORM ALLOWANCE WILL BE 
PROVIDED.
5.  DURING FINAL DEVELOPMENT, A SMALL SDK WEAR TEST WILL BE ESTABLISHED 
TO HELP EVALUATE THE FINAL UNIFORM COMPONENTS.  FINAL COST INFORMATION 
WILL BE AVAILABLE FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THIS TEST.
6.  FILE THIS NAVADMIN UNTIL CHANGES ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE 
QUARTERLY BUPERS DIRECTIVE CD-ROM CHANGE CONTAINING REF A.  IN THE
