RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the FY-17 flight hour verification process 
for conditional Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP) and Hazardous Duty 
Incentive Pay for Flying (HDIP-F).  In line with reference (a), all 
recipients of conditional ACIP or HDIP-F are required to track flight hours 
per month, and report them to Navy Personnel Command (NPC) ACIP Program 
Manager (PERS-435).  Commanding officers and other reporting seniors are 
responsible for verifying the accuracy and completeness of flight hour 
verification letters for officers under their charge, and reporting such by 
endorsing verification letters on command letterhead.  Templates for the 
reporting senior endorsement, as well as an example of the verification 
letter, can be found on the NPC website at http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/Detailing/aviation/OCM/Pages/default.aspx

2.  Conditional ACIP may be paid to those aeronautically designated officers 
in the following categories:
    a.  Aeromedical officers.
    b.  Aviation officers who would otherwise be eligible for continuous ACIP 
but have not met the months of operational flying requirements at the 12-year 
or 18-year gate.
    c.  Aviation officers, O-6 and below, who have completed the continuous 
ACIP program after 22 years (after passing the 18-year low gate) or 25 years 
(after passing the 18-year high gate).

3.  In order to be eligible for conditional ACIP, an officer must be under 
orders to Duty in a Flying Status Involving Operational or Training Flights 
(DIFOPS), must occupy a billet designated XXX1 or XXX2 (a DIFOPS billet), and 
must fly the minimum hours prescribed in reference (b).

4.  HDIP-F may be paid to non-aeronautically designated officers and 
aeronautically designated flag officers required by competent orders to 
participate in regular and frequent aerial flights as crew or non-
crewmembers.  HDIP-F eligibility requires a non-aeronautically designated 
officer to be under orders to duty involving flying as a technical observer.  
An aeronautically designated Flag officer must be under DIFOPS orders to 
maintain HDIP-F eligibility.  All must fly the minimum hours prescribed in 
reference (b).  Officers entitled to ACIP are not entitled to HDIP-F.

5.  Any officer who received any conditional ACIP or HDIP-F payment during 
FY-17 is required to provide total flight hours, by month, from 1 October 
2016 through 30 September 2017 to PERS-435 no later than 31 December 2017.  
If a member did not complete the minimum flight hour requirements as 
established in reference (b), unearned ACIP/HDIP-F will be recouped.  
Underpayments will also be corrected. If no flight hours are submitted by 31 
December 2017, the entitlement of the officer to ACIP or HDIP-F will stop and 
he or she will forfeit the entire FY-17 entitlement to conditional ACIP or 
HDIP-F.  The repayment process of the ACIP received will be initiated as 
applicable.  It is the responsibility of each individual recipient of 
conditional ACIP/HDIP-F to ensure that the flight hour verification letter 
and endorsement are completed in accordance with reference (a), to deliver 
them on time by mail/e-mail/fax to PERS-435, and to verify that they have 
been received by PERS-435 (see e-mail contacts below).

6.  Members shall send original flight hour submissions and command 
endorsements by mail to:
    Commander, Navy Personnel Command
    PERS-435
    5720 Integrity Drive
    Millington, TN 38055-4300

Submission of backup copies by e-mail is strongly encouraged to ensure 
receipt by PERS-435, but hardcopy of the original documents must be submitted 
to the address above.  E-mail submissions should be made to Mr. Paul Boundy 
at paul.boundy@navy.mil.  If e-mail is not possible, please fax submissions 
to (901) 874-2721/2756, attention PERS-435.

7.  Once flight hours are received, verification of hours flown and monthly 
entitlement(s) earned will be calculated by PERS-435. Overpayment and 
underpayment cases will be forwarded to Defense Financing and Accounting 
Service for appropriate corrective action. Negotiation of repayment plans for 
recoupment may be discussed directly with the servicing personnel support 
detachment of the member.

8.  Point of contact for ACIP and HDIP-F policy is LCDR Trevor Hermann, PERS-
435, at (901) 874-3484/DSN 882, or via e-mail at trevor.hermann(at)navy.mil.

9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled.
