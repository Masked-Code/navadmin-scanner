SUBJ/PASSING OF ADMIRAL KINNAIRD R. MCKEE, USN (RET), 2ND DIRECTOR OF THE 
NAVAL NUCLEAR PROPULSION PROGRAM////

RMKS/1. IT IS WITH DEEP SADNESS THAT I REPORT THE PASSING OF ADMIRAL KINNAIRD 
R. MCKEE, USN (RET) ON 30 DECEMBER 2013.
ADMIRAL MCKEE SERVED THE NATION, LEADING SAILORS DURING SOME OF OUR NATION'S 
MOST TRYING AND CHALLENGING TIMES. A GRADUATE OF THE NAVAL ACADEMY, HE WAS AN 
ACCOMPLISHED NAVAL OFFICER, SERVING ABOARD A DESTROYER AS WELL AS DIESEL AND 
NUCLEAR-POWERED SUBMARINES.
ADMIRAL MCKEE SERVED AS EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE FIRST NUCLEAR-POWERED 
SUBMARINE USS NAUTILUS (SSN 571) AND COMMANDING OFFICER OF USS DACE (SSN 
607). AS A FLAG OFFICER, ADMIRAL MCKEE SERVED AS COMMANDER, SUBMARINE GROUP 
EIGHT; NATO AND U.S. ALLIED COMMANDER IN THE MEDITERRANEAN; SUPERINTENDENT, 
U.S. NAVAL ACADEMY; COMMANDER, THIRD FLEET; DIRECTOR, NAVAL WARFARE, IN THE 
OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS; AND CONCLUDED HIS 41 YEARS IN 
UNIFORM AS THE NATION'S DIRECTOR, NAVAL NUCLEAR PROPULSION, THE 2ND OF ONLY 6 
PEOPLE TO HOLD THAT POSITION IN OVER 50 YEARS.

2. ADMIRAL MCKEE WAS AN INVENTIVE THINKER WHO PUSHED OUR NAVY  FORWARD.
DURING A CRITICAL TIME IN THE COLD WAR, ADMIRAL MCKEE WAS  INSTRUMENTAL IN 
DEVELOPING A VISION FOR THE NEWLY FORMED OFFICE OF NAVAL WARFARE.
AS SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NAVAL ACADEMY, ADMIRAL MCKEE BEGAN THE SUCCESSFUL 
INTEGRATION OF FEMALE MIDSHIPMEN AND MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO THE 
CURRICULUM.

3. SUCCEEDING ADMIRAL HYMAN RICKOVER AS DIRECTOR OF NAVAL REACTORS AFTER 
DECADES OF LEADING THE PROGRAM WAS A DAUNTING TASK WHICH ADMIRAL MCKEE 
HEARTILY EMBRACED AND FLOURISHED AT. WHILE DIRECTOR OF NAVAL REACTORS, 
ADMIRAL MCKEE SPEARHEADED THE USS SEAWOLF (SSN 21) PROPULSION PLANT DESIGN 
RESULTING IN IMPROVED STEALTH TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE STILL INSTRUMENTAL IN 
MAINTAINING THE STRATEGIC EDGE FOR THE U.S. SUBMARINE FORCE.

4. ADMIRAL MCKEE IS SURVIVED BY HIS BELOVED WIFE PATTI BAILEY MCKEE AND A 
NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. HE WAS A DEDICATED  HUSBAND AND FATHER, 
SUPERB FRIEND, AND A SIGNIFICANT SHIPMATE WHOSE LIFE LEFT AN INDELIBLE MARK 
ON ALL HE TOUCHED. HIS PASSING IS A TREMENDOUS LOSS TO OUR NAVY FAMILY. WE 
WILL NEVER FORGET THE LIFE AND HONORABLE SERVICE OF THIS GREAT LEADER.

5. RELEASED BY VICE ADMIRAL S. H. SWIFT, DIRECTOR, NAVY STAFF.//
