RMKS/1. In accordance with references A, B and C, all Navy Cybersecurity 
Workforce (CSWF) personnel (active duty, reserve, civilian, and contractor) 
are required to hold valid cybersecurity baseline credentials and complete 40 
hours of continuing education units (CEUs) each calendar year. Failure to 
complete this annual requirement and maintain the appropriate credential for 
a cybersecurity position places the employee at risk for removal from the 
CSWF position requiring credentials. Expired commercial certifications are a 
demonstration of non-compliance with prescribed DoD and SECNAV policies in 
references A through F.

2. Scope and Applicability. This NAVADMIN applies to all designated Navy CSWF 
personnel assigned to CSWF positions for six months or more. In accordance 
with references C and D, personnel may complete a combination of position 
relevant training, education, experiential learning, and commercial 
certification activities to fulfill the 40 -hour annual CEU requirement. 
Department of the Navy Chief Information Officer (DON CIO) conferences, and 
courses via Federal Virtual Training Environment (FedVTE), Skillport, and 
Navy Knowledge Online (NKO) are examples of activities that may qualify for 
continuing education units. To assist personnel with maintaining valid 
commercial certifications, CSWF personnel may continue to request vouchers 
from Navy Credentialing Opportunites On-line (COOL) to fund the annual 
continuing education and/or maintenance fees.
Navy COOL will not pay for any recertifying activities for an expired 
certification. Further information is available at the Navy COOL website 
https://www.cool.navy.mil//

3. CSWF personnel who fail to complete the aforementioned requirements are 
not qualified to serve in CSWF positions, negatively impact Command 
readiness, and weaken the Navy*s overall security posture.

4.  Commanders and Command Information Officers are directed to comply with 
references C and D for remediation of the stated workforce deficiencies no 
later than 31 March 2015.

5. All official requests for a one-time waiver from the above credential 
requirements must be addressed to the Department of the Navy Deputy Chief 
Information Officer (Navy) (DDCIO(N))and endorsed by a Flag Officer or SES at 
the Echelon II level. Waiver request templates can be found at: 
https://usff.portal.navy.mil/sites/cyberfor/cswf/default.aspx. Each employee 
waiver request must include an Individual Development Plan with significant 
milestones that specify the respective training, education, and certification 
activities to be completed under the direction of a qualified CSWF 
supervisor. All waiver requests are to be submitted no later than 31 December 
2014, and shall not extend beyond 31 March 2015. To facilitate tracking, the 
Navy Cybersecurity Workforce Management Office (NAVIDFOR N13) will 
consolidate all Echelon II CSWF personnel information and list of personnel 
requiring a waiver due to failure to hold a valid cybersecurity credential.  
CSWF personnel who fail to acquire and maintain cybersecurity credentials in 
accordance with the prescribed requirements in the waiver request package 
could be subject to personnel actions. DDCIO(N) waiver approvals do not alter 
any requirements levied by the baseline credentials certificate granting 
authorities.
