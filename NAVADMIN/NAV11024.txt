RMKS/1.  2010 NAVY SUICIDE PREVENTION STATISTICS INDICATE THAT PROGRESS HAS 
BEEN MADE DURING THE PAST YEAR.  AS A RESULT OF YOUR CONCENTRATED EFFORTS, 10 
FEWER SAILORS TOOK THEIR OWN LIVES IN 2010 THAN DID THE PREVIOUS YEAR.  
ANOTHER MEASURE OF YOUR EFFORTS IS THAT APPROXIMATELY 1,500 SAILORS CHOSE TO 
PURSUE HELP AS OPPOSED TO COMMITTING SUICIDE.  THESE SAILORS REACHED OUT TO A 
SHIPMATE, FAMILY MEMBER OR LEADER WHO REMEMBERED TO "ACT": A-ASK THE QUESTION, 
C-CARE AND HELP THE PERSON FIND T-TREATMENT.  NAVY'S SUICIDE PREVENTION 
APPROACH IS DESIGNED TO BUILD RESILIENCE THROUGH OPERATIONAL STRESS CONTROL 
(OSC), WHICH ADDRESSES THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH OF SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES, 
AND BY IMPROVING AWARENESS OF THOSE IN NEED AND THOSE IN A POSITION TO HELP.  
IT IS CLEAR THAT INTERVENTION, ACTIONS YOU TAKE, IS HAVING A PROFOUND EFFECT.

2.  REGRETTABLY, WE LOST 42 ACTIVE AND RESERVE SAILORS TO SUICIDE IN 2010.  
REMEMBER THAT THE PAIN OF SUICIDE DOES NOT END WITH A FUNERAL OR MEMORIAL 
SERVICE.

3.  FEEDBACK AND RESEARCH INDICATE THAT DURING TRANSITIONS, BOTH PROFESSIONAL 
(PCS MOVES, RETURN FROM DEPLOYMENT, AND SEPARATION FROM ACTIVE DUTY) AND 
PERSONAL (CHANGE IN MARITAL STATUS OR LOSS OF A LOVED ONE), SHIPMATES ARE AT 
INCREASED RISK OF MAKING REGRETTABLE DECISIONS.  DURING THESE PERIODS, WE MUST 
BE VIGILANT AND WILLING TO ACT TO PREVENT IRREVERSIBLE ACTS OF SELF HARM.

4.  FINALLY, WE MUST RECOGNIZE AND ACT UPON CONDITIONS THAT KEEP SAILORS OR 
ANYONE IN OUR NAVY FAMILY FROM GETTING THE HELP THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT.  
I THANK ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD IN BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS, 
PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUPPORTING OUR SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM.  
PLEASE KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK.
