RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces a single Calendar Year 2024 (CY2024) 
Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA), policy changes for postpartum wellness 
PFA, Command Fitness Leader (CFL) recertification and a PFA Physical 
Readiness Information Management System TWO (PRIMS-2) update. 
 
2.  PFA Cycle 2024.  The Navy remains absolutely committed to the physical 
readiness of our force.  Sustaining one PFA per year is designed to reduce 
administrative requirements and empower commanding officers to build 
healthier people, leaders and teams.  The cycle will be conducted from 1 
February to 30 November 2024 in line with references (a) through (e), which 
are located at:   
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/Culture-Resilience/Physical-
Readiness/. 
    a.  The PFA cycle will be opened in PRIMS-2 starting 1 December 2023 and 
will be labeled *Cycle 1 2024*. 
    b.  Sailors will electronically submit their Physical Activity Risk 
Factor Questionnaire via MyNavy Portal (My Records). 
    c.  There will be no excellent or above incentive physical readiness test 
exemption for CY2024 in line with reference (a). 
 
3.  The following changes to reference (a) are effective immediately: 
    a.  The CFL recertification requirement has been extended from three to 
five years (paragraph 6.l.(2)(a)7). 
    b.  The postpartum wellness (unofficial) PFA requirement is cancelled 
(paragraph 5.(c)(1)(c)1 through 3).  After delivery, Sailors should 
participate in a progressive and appropriate exercise program, as soon as 
medically authorized, to return to Navy physical fitness standards. 
 
4.  PRIMS-2 Update.  Commands are to ensure designated CFLs and assistant 
CFLs (ACFLs) request PRIMS-2 access in line with reference (d). 
    a.  CFL and ACFLs are reminded to log in every 30 days to avoid account 
deactivation.  Account reactivation can result in submission of an updated 
SAAR-N Form. 
    b.  Data Load Widget.  CFL and ACFLs are encouraged to use the data load 
widget (csv file) for ease of uploading PFA data in PRIMS-2. 
    c.  Transferring/Gaining PFA Records.  CFL and ACFLs are responsible for 
transferring and gaining a Sailor's PFA record in PRIMS-2. 
 
5.  Optimal performance is more than just being physically active and eating 
well.  It is about developing and optimizing every element of one's mind, 
body and spirit. 
     a.  Obstacles to healthy behaviors can include unrealistic expectations, 
insufficient time to exercise, inadequate sleep or improper nutrition, or 
physical injury.  If all Sailors treat their bodies as top-performing 
equipment and provide healthy nutrients to fuel them, they will last longer, 
perform better, recover faster, and be more efficient. 
     b.  The Navy Operational Fitness and Fueling System (NOFFS) is available 
to assist commands and Sailors to optimize the physical readiness and 
nutrition of Sailors.  Additional information on NOFFS is located at 
https://www.navyfitness.org/fitness/noffs-training and the NOFFS app, which 
can be downloaded on smartphone devices. 
 
6.  Contact the Physical Readiness Program Office for additional information: 
    a.  For policy related questions via e-mail at PRP@navy.mil. 
    b.  For PRIMS related questions via e-mail at PRIMS@navy.mil. 
    c.  For policy or PRIMS related questions via phone at (901) 874-2210/ 
DSN 882. 
 
7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or cancelled, 
whichever occurs first.
