THE EXCEPTION OF NON-TRANSFERRABLE TECHNOLOGY IDENTIFIED BY  NAVSEA AND NAVY 
IPO UNDER SEPCOR, NO ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT REMOVALS  ARE AUTHORIZED ON THE 
FRIGATES EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED BY  OPNAV N8F IN RESPONSE TO A 
RECORD MESSAGE REQUEST THAT INCLUDES  JUSTIFICATION FOR REMOVAL AND INCLUDES 
COORDINATION VIA THE  APPROPRIATE SYSTEMS COMMAND. TYCOMS ARE REQUIRED TO 
ENSURE STRICT ADHERENCE TO THIS DIRECTION. PER REFS A AND B, IT IS NAVY POLICY 
THAT SHIPS DESIGNATED FOR FMS TRANSFER SHALL NOT BE STRIPPED.  STRIPPING OF 
SHIPS PROVIDES DIMINISHED OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY TO MARITIME PARTNERS AND 
CORRODES OUR EFFORTS TO BUILD MARITIME PARTNER CAPACITY.  SEE PARAGRAPH 3 FOR 
ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENTREMOVAL GUIDANCE.

NOTE 2:  DATE INACTIVATION BEGINS IN A NAVAL SHIPYARD AND THE UNIT IS NO 
LONGER AVAILABLE FOR OPERATIONAL TASKING. FINAL DECOMMISSIONING DATE SHALL BE 
REPORTED TO THE CNO AND NVR CUSTODIAN IAW REFS B AND C.

REQUEST USFFC AND CPF COORDINATE REQUIREMENTS FOR UTILIZING VESSELS IN A 
LOGISTIC SUPPORT STATUS PRIOR TO THEIR DISMANTLEMENT WITH OPNAV N8F VIA N86.

3. AN OPNAV WORKING GROUP WILL BE REVIEWING THE LOGISTICAL NEEDS OF THE NAVY 
AND THE CAPABILITY NEEDS OF OUR MARITIME PARTNERS.  FLEET REPS, PROGRAM 
OFFICES, AND FMS STAKEHOLDERS WILL BE PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUSTIFY THEIR 
REQUIREMENTS FOR EQUIPMENT REMOVALS AND  EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES TO MITIGATE 
IMPACT TO FLEET AND INTERNATIONAL  PARTNERS AS PART OF THAT REVIEW.  DETAILS 
OF THE WORKING GROUP FORUM WILL BE PROVIDED VIA SEPCOR.

4. PER REFS B AND D, FLEET COMMANDERS SHALL SUBMIT AN ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE 
REQUEST (OCR) TO FORMALLY NOTIFY OPNAV OF A DECOMMISSIONING EFFECTIVE DATE. A 
REVISED OCR SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO ADJUST THE EFFECTIVE DATE DUE TO OPERATIONAL 
SCHEDULE CHANGES.

5. PER REF B, SHIP COMMANDING OFFICERS/MASTERS SHALL SEND A NAVAL MESSAGE 
ANNOUNCING THE ACTUAL DECOMMISSIONING DATE. IT SHALL BE ADDRESSED TO CNO 
WASHINGTON DC//00/09/N1/N2/N6/N4/N3/N5/N8/N9/. INFO ADDEES SHALL INCLUDE THE 
CHAIN OF COMMAND, ALL APPROPRIATE SUPPORT ACTIVITIES, COMNAVSEASYSCOM 
WASHINGTON DC//SEA 05C// AND NAVHISTHERITAGECOM WASHINGTON DC. MESSAGE SHOULD 
GIVE A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE LIFE OF THE SHIP TO INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT EVENTS.

6.  ADJUSTMENTS TO A DECOMMISSIONING OR INACTIVATION DATE THAT  CROSSES THE 
CURRENT FISCAL YEAR MUST BE COORDINATED WITH OPNAV N8F IAW REF B  DUE TO THE 
REPORTING REQUIREMENT THAT NAVY MUST INFORM CONGRESS ON EXECUTION YEAR FORCE 
STRUCTURE CHANGES THAT DIFFER FROM WHAT CONGRESS AUTHORIZED/APPROPRIATED AND 
SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE PRESIDENT. OPNAV SHALL PROMULGATE CHANGES TO THE 
INACTIVATION YEAR AS REQUIRED.
