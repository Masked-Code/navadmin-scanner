allocated to active CIMS users and training schedules will be finalized for a 
two hour basic training course on the ETMS2 system for all new 
users.  Training must be completed prior to using the ETMS2 system.  Training 
may be provided by ETMS2 contractors or local qualified trainers.  Training 
details will be finalized and communicated in the next few weeks. 
    b.  Phase II:  Commencing on or about 1 December 2021, CIMS will convert 
to read-only and active taskers will be migrated to ETMS2.  All new TM 
functions will be performed in ETMS2.  Users will still be able to view 
taskers in CIMS. 
    c.  Phase III:  Commencing 31 December 2021, users will no longer be able 
to access CIMS.  Closed taskers will only be accessible through an offline 
database. Requests for access to the offline database may be addressed to the
