SUBJ/ NOTICE OF CONVENING FY-22 NAVY RESERVE OFFICER PROMOTION SELECTION 
BOARDS (PART II)//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces Part II of the Notice of Convening
FY-22 promotion selection boards.  Due to the delay of FY-21 promotion 
selection board results, which were impacted by coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) stop movements, the FY-22 promotion selection boards have been 
divided into two parts.  Part I consisted of promotion selection boards to 
recommend officers on the Reserve Active-Status List (RASL) for permanent 
promotion to the grades of captain, commander, and lieutenant commander in 
the line, with the exception of officers on the RASL for permanent promotion 
to the grade of lieutenant commander in the Full Time Support (FTS) 
Unrestricted Line (URL); and officers on the RASL  for permanent promotion to 
the grades of captain and commander in the Staff Corps.
Part II consists of promotion selection boards to recommend URL FTS officers 
on the RASL for permanent promotion to the grade of lieutenant commander, 
officers on the RASL for permanent promotion to the grade of lieutenant 
commander in the staff corps, and officers on the RASL for permanent 
promotion to the grade of chief warrant officer.  A NAVADMIN announcing Part 
I of the Notice of Convening FY-22 promotion selection boards was released at 
an earlier date.

2.  Part II of the FY-22 promotion selection boards will be convened as 
follows:

4.  Officers in the grades of lieutenant are elgible for consideration for 
promotion only if they have served continuously on either the RASL or Active 
Duty List (or a combination of both lists) during the one-year period ending 
on the date of the convening of the promotion board.  Accordingly, officers 
returning to an active status from a period of inactive or broken service 
(USNR-S2,
discharge) are eligible for consideration for promotion only after 
continuously serving in an active status for one full year.
Membership in the Individual Ready Reserve does not qualify for deferment of 
eligibility for consideration.

5.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a promotion selection board 
via the Letter to the Board (LTB) process.  NAVADMIN 220/19 announced the 
introduction of a new application known as Electronic Submission of Selection 
Board Documents (ESSBD), accessible through MyNavy Portal (MNP).  ESSBD 
improves the speed, transparency, and confidence of receipt over current LTB 
submission methods, such as hard copy and e-mail submitted letters and 
related attachments.
    a.  ESSBD will be available for all promotion and selection boards.
    b.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to electronically 
submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without attachments and 
will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) exactly what will 
be delivered and presented to the board.
    c.  To use ESSBD, candidates must access document services through MNP at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record.  On-screen instructions will direct 
the submitter thereafter.
    d.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted.  If required, a full visual user 
guide is available at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion.
    e.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command not later than 2359 
(central daylight time (CDT)) 10 days prior to the convening date of the 
respective board, as noted below.  Submitters are cautioned not to wait until 
the deadline date to submit LTBs via ESSBD or other available avenues.
Selection To                      Convening Date  Due Date / Time
Staff Corps Lieutenant Commander  14 APR 21      3 APR 21 / 2359 CDT
URL Lieutenant Commander          24 MAY 21     13 MAY 21 / 2359 CDT
Chief Warrant Officer 5/4/3       3 JUN 21      23 MAY 21 / 2359 CDT
    f.  If sending a board package from a non-NMCI network (bumed.mil, 
eu.navy.mil, etc.), please review procedures listed in NAVADMIN 220/19.
    g.  The written communication may call attention to the board any matter 
concerning the record of the officer that the officer considers important.  
Written communication may include, as enclosures, correspondence from any 
individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not originated by 
the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of the eligible 
officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must contain a written 
acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she desires such 
correspondence be presented to the board.
Correspondence without such an acknowledgement is considered third- party 
correspondence and will be returned without being presented to the board.  
Classified correspondence will not be accepted.

6.  Questions regarding LTB submission should be directed to MyNavy Career 
Center by calling 1-833-330-MNCC (1-833-330-6622 / DSN: 882- 6622).

7.  All officers are reminded it is their responsibility to ensure their 
personnel records are substantially accurate and complete.

8.  The CSCSELBOARD(at)NAVY.MIL mailbox account is capable of receiving 
encrypted correspondence in accordance with Department of Defense policy.  If 
you are sending your board package from a non- NMCI network please visit 
https://dod4ll.gds.disa.mil to download the required mailbox certificate.  To 
download the *certificate* (please note, you MUST be using MS Outlook with a 
CAC reader, including *ActivClient* software, and have Internet Explorer or 
Netscape 7), go to https://dod411.gds.disa.mil, type CSCSELBOARD(at)NAVY.MIL 
in the *E-Mail address* field, then click *Search.*  Click the *CSC* link 
under *Last Name.*  Click on the link *Download Certificate(s) as vCard.*  
Click *Software Certificate for CSCSELBOARD(at)NAVY.MIL.*  Click the *Open*
