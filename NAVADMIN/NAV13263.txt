SUBJ/NAVY BIRTHDAY 2013//

1.  Happy Birthday, Navy!  On 13 October, we will mark the 238th anniversary 
of the birth of our Navy.  Across that expanse of years, our Navy has grown 
from a handful of modest but sturdy men-of-war to a vast fleet of the world's 
mightiest warships and aircraft.  We are present in strength around the world 
as a comfort to friends, and a caution to potential foes.
2.  This year marks the bicentennial of one of the formative events in the 
development of our Navy:  The Battle of Lake Erie.  U.S.
Naval forces, under the command of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, won a hard-
fought engagement against a squadron of the Royal Navy. 
Perrys report of the battle, which was a strategically important victory in 
the War of 1812, commenced with the famous words, "We have met the enemy and 
they are ours." 
3.  In similar intrepid fashion and without respite, the Navy has proudly 
protected our Nation's security and advanced her interests ever since.  
Today, our presence is global.  Our Fleet is modern and capable.  We are 
ready for the future with new platforms such as the Littoral Combat Ship, USS 
GERALD R FORD class aircraft carriers, and the Unmanned Carrier-Launched 
Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) system.
4.  The most important element of our success is, and always has been, our 
people.  Your hard work and dedication carry on the tradition of the 
generations who have gone before us.  They would be proud of your service and 
self-sacrifice.  Additionally, generations to come will look back at how well 
our people have served our Navy and Nation during these challenging times.
5.  Thank you for all that you do.  I could not be prouder of the way our 
Sailors, Civilians, and Families have performed over the past year.  Keep up 
the great work - it is my honor to be your shipmate.
6.  Released by the Chief of Naval Operations.//
