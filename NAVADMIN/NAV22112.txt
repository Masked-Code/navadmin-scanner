RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Navy Seabee Underwater Construction 
Technician (UCT) Master Diver Retention Bonus (RB) Program. 
 
2.  Program Overview.  This bonus is authorized under references (a) and 
(c).  Specific critical Navy enlisted classifications (NEC) and approved 
award levels have been prescribed by Assistant Secretary of Navy (Manpower 
and Reserve Affairs) (ASN (M and RA)).  The Navy Seabee Enlisted Community 
Manager (BUPERS-329) will act as the UCT RB Program Manager.  All 
applications for this bonus will be submitted to the UCT RB program manager 
for processing and tracking. 
In line with reference (b), a Service Member (SM) may receive no more than 
360,000 dollars in RB monies over a career.  Selective reenlistment bonus 
awards are included in this cap. 
 
3.  Eligibility.  In line with reference (c), UCT senior enlisted SMs with 
NEC B18A, in paygrades E-7 and above, who have between 20 and 27 years of 
active service, shall be eligible to apply for the UCT RB but must also meet 
the following eligibility criteria: 
    a.  Be serving on Active Duty in a regular component. 
    b.  Have the favorable recommendation of the commanding officer for 
receipt of UCT RB. 
    c.  Be assigned to a valid B18A billet throughout the duration of the RB 
period. 
    d.  Be fit for full duty. 
 
4.  Ineligibility 
    a.  SMs serving under an existing RB contract are not eligible to receive 
an additional RB for service outlined in the original contract agreement. 
    b.  SMs are not eligible for RB payments past their high year tenure 
(HYT) date.  HYT waiver requests must be completed before submitting a UCT RB 
application. 
 
5.  Contract Terms.  UCT RB contract lengths, payments and Active Duty 
service obligations are outlined below. 
    a.  SMs may sign a contract in their 20th year of service (YOS). 
RB payments begin at 20 YOS.  Enlisted SMs may contract to their HYT 
mark.  E-7s are eligible to contract to 24 YOS.  E-8s are eligible 
to contract to 26 YOS.  E-9s are eligible to contract to 30 YOS.  If 
a SM serves a partial year, that year will be prorated.  Specific 
bonus amounts are graduated pursuant to YOS. 
        (1) 15,000 dollars per year for 3-year contracts. 
        (2) 17,500 dollars per year for 4-year contracts. 
        (3) 20,000 dollars per year for 5-year contracts. 
    b.  UCT RB contracts may be for a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 
5 years.  SMs under RB contract will not submit a request for retirement or 
tender a resignation with an effective date that is prior to completion of 
the agreement.  Enlisted SMs must reenlist or extend their enlistment 
contract, soft end of active obligated service, for a period of at least 2 
years.  SMs are authorized early reenlistment in order to align RB and 
reenlistment contracts. 
Reenlistments and extensions may be combined to align service dates for 
maximum opportunity, up to a reenlistment of 6 years and extension of up to 
12 months. 
 
6.  Program Execution 
    a.  SMs should submit requests for UCT RB to the program manager 
60 to 180 days prior to entering into a UCT RB contract via their chain of 
command.  If operational commitments limit the ability to submit RB 
applications via this manner, commands should submit requests through their 
immediate superior in the chain of command who can submit the request to the 
program manager. 
    b.  Upon acceptance of an agreement of the SM by the program manager, the 
amount of the bonus becomes fixed and the SM incurs a firm service 
obligation. 
    c.  SMs will receive the annual bonus amount in a lump sum payment, 
effective from the date of contract execution. 
    d.  RB requests for personnel who are being processed for disciplinary 
action, NEC removal or restoration will be held in abeyance pending final 
resolution. 
    e.  SMs unable to complete the service obligation specified in the RB 
agreement may be subjected to repayment of any unearned portion of the 
retention bonus. 
    f.  All payments must be made before the SM reaches their 28th year of 
service.  Any payment that would be due to the SM past this point will be 
included in the final regular payment scheduled prior to reaching their 28th 
year.
