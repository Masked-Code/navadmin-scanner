RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a).

2.  Enlisted Supervisor Retention Pay (ESRP) provides a retention incentive 
to senior Navy nuclear-trained enlisted personnel with highly specialized 
skills.  The legal authority for ESRP shifted from section 355 of reference 
(b) to section 331 of reference (b) effective 4 July 2016.  Current ESRP 
requirements limit the program as follows:
    a.  The minimum reenlistment length is 3 years.
    b.  The maximum bonus amount for each year of obligated service is 
limited to $25,000.  The implication of this limit is that the maximum ESRP 
bonus for a 3 year reenlistment is $75,000.
    c.  All ESRP payments must be received prior to completion of 26 years of 
service.  The implication of this limit is that any ESRP installment that 
would be due after 26 years of service will be paid in the final installment 
prior to completion of 26 years of service.

3.  Award Multiples.  Updated ESRP multiple values are listed below:
    a.  ESRP Zones 1 multiples (additional obligated service (AOS)

4.  Eligibility.  Only Sailors assigned an active supervisory nuclear Navy 
enlisted classification (NEC) listed in paragraph 3 (or equivalent) are 
eligible to reenlist for ESRP.  In addition, security clearances must be 
current or in an Open for New Investigation status.  ESRP requests and 
anniversary payments for personnel with inactive NECs (3359/3389 or 
equivalent) will be held in abeyance pending final resolution.  Overall ESRP 
eligibility requirements are defined in reference (c).  In addition, to 
encourage career progression and provide incentive for continued superior at-
sea service, the following supplementary eligibility requirements remain in 
place for each ESRP zone:
    a.  ESRP Zone 1.  In addition to the requirements of reference
(c), be assigned an active nuclear supervisory NEC (see paragraph 3).
    b.  ESRP Zone 2.  In addition to the requirements of reference
(c), be a frocked E-7 or in the paygrade of E-7, E-8, or E-9 on the date of 
the ESRP Zone 2 reenlistment.
    c.  ESRP Zone 3.  In addition to the requirements of reference (c):
        (1) Be a frocked E-8 or in the paygrade of E-8 or E-9 on the date of 
the ESRP Zone 3 reenlistment, and
        (2) Have successfully previously served as, be currently serving as 
(on orders), or have been issued and accepted orders as a submarine 
Engineering Department Master Chief, Nuclear Aircraft Carrier (CVN) Major 
Division Leading Chief Petty Officer, CVN Reactor Training Division Officer, 
or CVN Reactor Department Master Chief.

5.  Application Process.  To ensure the approval message is released in a 
timely manner, ESRP reenlistment requests will be submitted 35-120 days in 
advance of the desired reenlistment date.  Exceptions to this policy will be 
approved by the ESRP program manager on an individual basis.
    a.  Officer Personnel Information System (OPINS) Force Management System 
is programmed to process ESRP reenlistment requests and employs the same 
process used to request and approve selective reenlistment bonus reenlistment 
requests.  Career counselors and personnel support detachments are familiar 
with this program and should use it as the primary method of ESRP request 
submission.  The ESRP request type is 3AA for Sailors on active duty and 3BB 
for broken service requests.
    b.  If OPINS is not available, the command can e-mail (scanned copy of 
request), or mail the request directly to the ESRP program manager using the 
format found in reference (c).  If operational commitments limit the ability 
to submit ESRP applications via this manner, commands should submit the ESRP 
request via message to the immediate superior in charge, who can submit the 
OPINS request. ESRP requests sent directly to the ESRP program manager by 
message or mail may result in a processing delay.
    c.  E-6 and below Zone 1 Sailors not already obligated beyond 14 years of 
service will require an approved Career Waypoints (C-WAY) reenlistment quota.  
C-WAY submission and quota approval can be pursued in parallel with the OPINS 
request for ESRP.
    d.  A Sailor must be pre-approved for an ESRP reenlistment. ESRP approval 
will not currently notify the Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) of the 
intent of the Sailor to reenlist.  Until DJMS can be programmed to accept 
ESRP reenlistment payments, manual processing is required.  Payments should 
post to the account of the Sailor within 14 days following the day the ESRP 
program manager receives notification of reenlistment.  Initial payment will 
be authorized as soon as the contract execution is reflected in the enlisted 
master file (EMF).  In order to ensure prompt payment, new contracts must be 
posted to the EMF in a timely manner.
    e.  Personnel support detachments and commands should contact Nuclear 
Propulsion Programs (OPNAV N133D) vice Defense Finance and Accounting System 
to resolve any payment issues.
    f.  A Sailor with an approved pre-certification, who does not reenlist on 
the date specified in the pre-certification message, must resubmit a request 
to revise the reenlistment date and ESRP award amount.

6.  Recoupment.  Receipt of any ESRP bonus is contingent upon the fulfillment 
of the specific conditions of eligibility, service, and assignment of the 
ESRP program.  A Sailor who fails to fulfill these specified conditions 
during the period of service agreed upon, shall repay the U.S. Navy any 
unearned portion of the bonus.  Examples of situations requiring repayment 
are provided in reference (c).

7.  Service Record Entry.  An Administrative Remarks (NAVPERS 1070/613) entry 
acknowledging recoupment policy via Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System 
is required to be entered into the service members record prior to execution 
of an ESRP reenlistment (examples are provided in reference (c)).

8.  ESRP-eligible Sailors and their command career counselors should review 
reference (c), which provides further program details. Reference (c) can be 
found on the nuclear enlisted community manager website:  
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/enlisted/community/nuclear/Pages/default.aspx.

9.  Point of contact is OPNAV N133D at (703)604-5502/5491/5492/5493/DSN 664, 
or via e-mail at nxag_n133d3(at)navy.mil or bullnuke(at)navy.mil.
