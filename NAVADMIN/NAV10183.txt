SUBJ/NAVAL OPERATIONS CONCEPT 2010//

RMKS/1.  TODAY, THE COMMANDANT OF THE MARINE CORPS, THE COMMANDANT OF 
THE COAST GUARD, AND I RELEASED THE NAVAL OPERATIONS CONCEPT 2010 (NOC 
10).

2.  DEVELOPED WITH THE SAME COOPERATIVE SPIRIT AND UNITY OF EFFORT THAT 
PRODUCED THE MARITIME STRATEGY, NOC 10 DESCRIBES HOW, WHEN, AND WHERE 
UNITED STATES NAVAL FORCES WILL CONTRIBUTE TO PREVENTING CONFLICT AND 
PREVAILING IN WAR, AND EMPHASIZES HOW THE NAVY, MARINE CORPS, AND COAST 
GUARD WILL WORK TOGETHER IN CONCERT WITH A HOST OF JOINT, INTERAGENCY, 
AND MULTINATIONAL PARTNERS.

3.  NOC 10 DETAILS THE WAYS IN WHICH THE SEA SERVICES WILL ACHIEVE THE 
ENDS ARTICULATED IN THE MARITIME STRATEGY.  NOC 10 IS ORGANIZED AROUND, 
AND EXPANDS UPON, THE SIX CORE CAPABILITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE MARITIME 
STRATEGY:  FORWARD PRESENCE, DETERRENCE, SEA CONTROL, POWER PROJECTION, 
MARITIME SECURITY, AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE/DISASTER RESPONSE.  IT 
DESCRIBES HOW WE USE THE SEA AS MANEUVER SPACE AND EMPLOY NAVAL FORCES 
ACROSS THE FULL RANGE OF MILITARY OPERATIONS.

4.  THE CONCEPT IS AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD AT WWW.NAVY.MIL/MARITIME/NOC.  
ALL HANDS SHOULD READ IT; OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SHOULD 
INCORPORATE IT INTO CURRICULA; AND TRAINING OFFICERS SHOULD TRAIN TO IT, 
TALK ABOUT IT, AND ENGAGE EACH OTHER AND LEADERSHIP IN DISCUSSIONS 
CONCERNING ITS CONTENT.  AS I VISIT THE FLEET IN THE COMING MONTHS, I 
LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN ONGOING DIALOGUE ABOUT OUR NEW CONCEPT.

5.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.
