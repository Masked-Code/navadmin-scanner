SUBJ/PASSING OF REAR ADMIRAL JEREMIAH A. DENTON JR., USN (RET)//

RMKS/1. It is with deep sadness that I report the passing of Rear Admiral 
Jeremiah A. Denton Jr., USN (Ret) on 28 March 2014. Rear Admiral Denton 
served our country as a naval aviator and statesman during some of our 
nation's most trying and difficult times. His leadership in uniform is the 
epitome of heroism and an inspiration to generations of Sailors.

2. In 1965, flying as the Commanding Officer of Attack Squadron SEVEN FIVE, 
his A-6 Intruder was shot down over the city of Thanh Hoa in North Vietnam. 
Held captive for nearly eight years as a Prisoner Of War (POW), he inspired 
his fellow prisoners to continue to resist. When forced to participate in a 
televised 1966 press conference, he blinked his eyes in Morse Code, 
repeatedly spelling out the word "T-O-R-T-U-R-E." This act of valor was the 
first confirmation that American POWs were being tortured in North Vietnam.

3. As Commandant of the Joint Forces Staff College, Rear Admiral Denton was 
an innovative thinker, credited with revolutionizing naval strategy and 
tactics. Following his retirement from naval service in 1977, he went on to 
serve in the United States Senate from 1981 until 1987 representing the great 
state of Alabama.

4. Rear Admiral Denton was a dedicated husband and father as well as a highly 
decorated combat veteran whose life left an indelible mark on our Nation. He 
served as an example for us all and we will never forget his life of 
honorable service nor the words that he spoke upon release from his captors, 
"God Bless America." His passing is a tremendous loss to our Navy family.

5. Released by Vice Admiral S. H. Swift, Director, Navy Staff.//
