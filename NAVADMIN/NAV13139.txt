these outstanding logisticians.

3.  In recognition of exceptional operational performance, the Navy League 
presents this award to those Supply Corps Officers who have made significant 
contributions to the supply readiness of our operating forces.  The awards 
presentation is TBD due to the current necessity to limit travel for fiscal 
reasons to mission essential reasons only.  For additional information, 
contact LCDR Scott Long, PERS 4412, at (901) 874-4624, DSN 882-4624, or email:
