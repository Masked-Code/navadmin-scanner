SUBJ/ NAVY 2010 EARTH DAY MESSAGE//

RMKS/1.  ON 22 APRIL THE NAVY AND THE NATION WILL CELEBRATE THE 40TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF EARTH DAY.  OUR NAVY THEME THIS YEAR IS "PARTNERING FOR A 
GREENER FUTURE."

2.  IN OUR ON-GOING EFFORTS AND ACTIONS TO PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP 
AND INCREASE ENERGY SECURITY AND THE READINESS OF OUR FORCES, WE ESTABLISHED 
PARTNERSHIPS WITH A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANIZATIONS.  OUR PARTNERS INCLUDE THE 
OTHER MILITARY SERVICES, FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES, NON-GOVERNMENT 
ORGANIZATIONS, INDUSTRY, AND OTHERS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY EXPERTISE.  
THESE PARTNERSHIPS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE NAVY. WE RELY ON THEM TO ACHIEVE 
SHARED GOALS OF PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDING ENERGY SECURITY FOR 
OUR NATION AND ALLIES.

3.  THE NAVY AND OUR PARTNERS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE FOLLOWING.
- NAVY ENVIRONMENTAL FORUM.  IN MARCH, OPNAV N45 HOSTED THE FIRST NAVY 
ENVIRONMENTAL FORUM TO PROMOTE AWARENESS OF NAVY-WIDE ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROGRAMS/INITIATIVES, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING, MARINE MAMMAL 
RESEARCH, AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION EFFORTS.  THESE FORUMS WILL HELP 
BUILD 
LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STAKEHOLDERS.
- OCEAN POLICY TASK FORCE.  SINCE SUMMER 2009, THE NAVY HAS PARTICIPATED IN 
THE INTERAGENCY OCEAN POLICY TASK FORCE, LED BY THE WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL ON 
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY.  THE PURPOSE OF THE TASK FORCE IS TO DEVELOP NATIONAL 
POLICY AND A FRAMEWORK THAT ENABLES SUSTAINABLE USE OF OUR OCEANS, GREAT 
LAKES, AND COASTAL AREAS IN A MANNER THAT SUPPORTS OUR NATION'S 
ENVIRONMENTAL, 
ECONOMIC, RECREATIONAL, AND SECURITY PRIORITIES.
- ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AT SEA. THE NAVY HAS COMPLETED ENVIRONMENTAL 
PLANNING, PERMITTING AND CONSULTATIONS FOR EIGHT TRAINING, TESTING, AND 
OPERATING AREAS AT SEA.  WE WILL COMPLETE AN ADDITIONAL SIX WITHIN A YEAR.  
THESE EFFORTS WILL MARK THE BEGINNING OF A CONTINUOUS CYCLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL 
PLANNING WORK AND ANNUAL RENEWALS WITH THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE.  
THE RENEWALS WILL BE SUPPORTED BY EXTENSIVE REPORTING AND CONSULTATION 
REQUIREMENTS.
- MARINE MAMMAL STRANDINGS.  THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE AND THE 
NAVY WILL SIGN A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) AT THE END OF APRIL TO 
ESTABLISH A NATIONAL FRAMEWORK WHEREBY NAVY MAY ASSIST THE NATIONAL MARINE 
FISHERIES SERVICE WITH RESPONSE TO AND INVESTIGATION OF MARINE MAMMAL 
STRANDING EVENTS DURING MAJOR TRAINING EXERCISES.
- MARINE MAMMAL RESEARCH PROGRAM.  THE NAVY COLLABORATES WITH ACADEMIC 
INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN DEVELOPING OUR ANNUAL RESEARCH 
FUNDING 
PRIORIES TO INCREASE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MARINE MAMMALS AND TO 
MINIMIZE 
THE POTENTIAL FOR OUR ACTIVITIES TO AFFECT MARINE LIFE. THE NAVY WILL SHARE 
OUR MARINE MAMMAL RESEARCH PROGRAM PLAN WITH INTERESTED NON-GOVERNMENT 
ORGANIZATIONS AT THE END OF APRIL.  INPUT FROM THOSE GROUPS WILL BE 
CONSIDERED 
FOR FUTURE RESEARCH.
- ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION.  THE NAVY CONTINUES ITS EXCELLENT PROGRESS ON 
ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION AT OUR INSTALLATIONS.  MANY PROJECTS ARE 
INCORPORATING LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES TO CONTROL AND MINIMIZE 
RUNOFF 
INTO SENSITIVE COASTAL WATERWAYS.  IN NORFOLK, VIRGINIA, LANDFILL CAPS AND 
PARKING LOTS IN REMEDIATION AREAS ARE BEING DESIGNED TO ALLOW WATER TO SAFELY 
FILTER DOWN THROUGH THE SOIL RATHER THAN CREATING RUNOFF INTO THE CHESAPEAKE 
BAY.

4.  EARLIER THIS YEAR, SECRETARY MABUS ANNOUNCED, HIS FIVE ENERGY GOALS THAT 
WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE ENERGY SECURITY FOR OUR NAVY AND THE NATION.  THE 
GOALS INCLUDE HAVING 50 PERCENT OF THE NAVY'S TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION 
PRODUCED BY ALTERNATIVE SOURCES BY 2020; CHANGING THE WAY THE DEPARTMENT 
AWARDS CONTRACTS DURING THE ACQUISITION PROCESS TO CONSIDER THE LIFETIME 
ENERGY COST OF THE SYSTEM; CREATING A "GREEN STRIKE GROUP" COMPOSED OF 
NUCLEAR 
AND BIOFUEL POWERED VESSELS BY 2016; REDUCING PETROLEUM USE IN THE 
DEPARTMENT'S COMMERCIAL VEHICLE FLEET BY 50 PERCENT USING HYBRID FUEL AND 
ELECTRIC VEHICLES BY 2015; AND PRODUCING AT LEAST HALF OF ALL SHORE-BASED 
ENERGY REQUIREMENTS FROM RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND HALF OUR BASES BEING NET 
ZERO 
ENERGY CONSUMERS BY 2020.  WE ARE MAKING GREAT STRIDES TOWARDS ACHIEVING 
SECRETARY MABUS' GOALS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE:
- GREEN HORNET. ON EARTH DAY, AN F/A-18 HORNET WILL COMPLETE A TEST FLIGHT AT 
NAVAL AIR STATION PATUXENT RIVER, MD USING A 50/50 BLEND OF CAMELINA-BASED 
FUEL AND CONVENTIONAL JP-5 JET FUEL. THE TEST FLIGHT IS A STEPPING STONE 
TOWARD NAVY'S GOAL OF SAILING THE GREAT GREEN FLEET BY 2016 SUPPORTED BY 
AIRCRAFT FLYING ON BIOFUEL.  THE NAVY IS ALSO PARTICIPATING IN RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS TO INDENTIFY OTHER BIOFUEL SOURCES WITH THE GOAL OF 
REDUCING OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN ENERGY SOURCES AND USING A FUEL WITH A 
LOWER NET CARBON FOOTPRINT THAN PETROLEUM FUELS.
- ENERGY EFFICIENCY.  WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING A BROAD SPECTRUM OF 
EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES SUCH AS STERN FLAPS AND PROPELLER COATINGS, ADJUSTING 
OPERATING PROCEDURES AND REDUCING OUR OVERALL CONSUMPTION OF PETROLEUM, 
ENHANCING COMBAT CAPABILITY, AND REDUCING THE ECOLOGICAL IMPACT OF OUR 
OPERATIONS.
- USS MAKIN ISLAND. USS MAKIN ISLAND IS THE EIGHTH WASP CLASS AMPHIBIOUS 
ASSAULT SHIP.  COMMISSIONED IN CY2009, IT IS THE FIRST NEW CONSTRUCTION 
PLATFORM TO BE EQUIPPED WITH A HYBRID PROPULSION PLANT THAT POWERS THE SHIP 
WITH ELECTRIC MOTORS AT LOW SPEEDS AND GAS TURBINE ENGINES AT HIGHER SPEEDS.  
THE SHIP'S GAS TURBINES ARE LIGHTER AND MORE FUEL EFFICIENT THAN THE STEAM 
BOILERS USED TO POWER OLDER AMPHIBIOUS ASSAULT SHIPS.  THIS HYBRID PROPULSION 
APPROACH AND OTHER DESIGN EFFICIENCIES ENABLE THE SHIP TO TRAVEL FARTHER ON 
LESS FUEL AND WILL SAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FUEL COSTS OVER 
THE 
LIFE OF THE SHIP.
- SHORE ENERGY PROGRAM.  THE NAVY'S COMPREHENSIVE SHORE ENERGY PROGRAM IS 
FOCUSED ON EFFICIENCY AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY FACILITIES AND VEHICLES.  OVER 
THE PAST SIX YEARS, OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY HAS INCREASED 14 PERCENT THROUGH 
INFRASTRUCTURE MODERNIZATION, INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS, AND 
SUSTAINABLE DESIGN PRACTICES FOR OUR NEW FACILITIES.  WE INVESTED A PORTION 
OF 
OUR AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) FUNDING TO DEVELOP OCEAN 
THERMAL ENERGY CONVERSION (OTEC) TECHNOLOGY.  WE ARE WORKING WITH INDUSTRY TO 
DEVELOP TIDAL TURBINES IN PUGET SOUND, WA AND WAVE GENERATORS OFF THE COAST 
OF 
OREGON.  A 200 MILLION DOLLAR MULTIPLE AWARD CONTRACT FOR SOLAR ELECTRICAL 
POWER AT INSTALLATIONS ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST WILL PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY 
FACILITIES AND REDUCED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.  IN MARCH, WE CUT THE RIBBON 
ON OUR FIRST "LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN" (LEED) SILVER 
CERTIFIED FACILITY AT NAVAL BASE VENTURA COUNTY.  THIS BUILDING WILL USE 31 
PERCENT LESS ENERGY AND 23 PERCENT LESS WATER.  MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF ITS 
CONSTRUCTION WASTE WAS DIVERTED FROM LANDFILL DISPOSAL.  ALL FUTURE MILITARY 
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ARE BEING DESIGNED TO MEET LEED SILVER STANDARDS FOR 
FUTURE ENERGY COST AVOIDANCE, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION, AND ENHANCED 
ENERGY SECURITY FOR THE SHORE INFRASTUCTURE.

5.  ON EARTH DAY AND THE FOLLOWING MONTHS, MANY BASES AND NAVY PERSONNEL 
WORLDWIDE WILL HOST ACTIVITIES THAT CELEBRATE THESE AND OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
THAT HELP TO SIMULTANEOUSLY PRESERVE OUR PLANET WHILE ALSO INCREASING OUR 
NATION'S ENERGY SECURITY.  I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN EARTH 
DAY EVENTS AND TO SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF NAVY ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROGRAMS WITH YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY ON A CONTINUAL BASIS.

6.  I GREATLY APPRECIATE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP, HARD WORK, AND 
DRIVE TO HELP MAKE OUR NAVY A PREMIER ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY LEADER/STEWARD 
AND TO INCREASE OUR ENERGY SECURITY.

7.  POINT OF CONTACT:  MR. KEN HESS, OPNAV N45P2, AT (703)418-3417 OR VIA 
EMAIL AT KENNETH.HESS@NAVY.MIL.
