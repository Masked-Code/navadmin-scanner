RMKS/1. THE DECISION TO EVACUATE AHEAD OF OR FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHIC
EVENT HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON OUR PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES.
EVACUATION DECISIONS DIRECTLY AFFECT BOTH MISSION READINESS AND
SAILOR QUALITY OF LIFE.
2. SAFE EXPEDITIOUS EVACUATION PROCEDURES DEPEND UPON SEVERAL
FACTORS.  TO THIS END, COMMANDER, NAVY INSTALLATIONS COMMAND, HAS
ISSUED STANDARDIZED GUIDANCE FOR THE EXECUTION OF MASS EVACUATIONS.
THIS GUIDANCE, CONTAINED IN APPENDIX U OF REF A, IS BASED ON LESSONS
LEARNED FROM HURRICANES KATRINA, RITA, AND WILMA, AND REFINEMENTS
MADE DURING MULTIPLE NAVY AND JOINT EXERCISES. IT STANDARDIZES
PROCEDURES THAT ENSURE SAFE EVACUATION, RELIABLE ACCOUNTABILITY OF
OUR PEOPLE (REF B GERMANE), AND EXPEDITIOUS MISSION RECONSTITUTION.
3. ALL NAVY COMMANDS, DETACHMENTS AND ACTIVITIES SHALL REVIEW AND
COMPLY WITH REF A EVACUATION GUIDANCE, AS REQUIRED.  REF A, APPENDIX
U CAN BE ACCESSED ONLINE AT:
HTTP:/138.147.73.39/NEWS/20060612_CNIC_EMP_APPENDIX_U.PDF.
4. THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ALL NAVY COMMANDS WORLDWIDE.  THOUGH THE
2005 HURRICANES HAVE FOCUSED MUCH ATTENTION ON THE US GULF COAST,
EVERY REGION BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD FACES THREATS FROM UNPLANNED,
CATASTROPHIC EVENTS.  A CULTURE OF READINESS DEMANDS THAT ALL
COMMANDS BE PREPARED FOR THESE CONTINGENCIES.

OPERATIONS.//
