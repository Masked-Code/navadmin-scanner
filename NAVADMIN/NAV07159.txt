RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE STAND UP OF TASK FORCE
LIFE/WORK (TFLW) WHICH WILL INCLUDE A TEAM FROM ACROSS THE FLEET, NAVY 
ENTERPRISES AND OFFICER/ENLISTED COMMUNITIES WITH THE MISSION OF 
DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES, PROGRAMS, AND CHANGES WITH THE 
REAL POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE OUR SAILORS  LIFE/WORK BALANCE.
2.  RECENTLY A SMALL NUMBER OF NAVY FLAGS, DON SENIOR CIVILIANS, AND 
SENIOR ENLISTED LEADERS MET TO EXAMINE THE EMERGING CHALLENGES WE FACE 
IN RECRUITING AND RETAINING THE NEXT GENERATION OF 21ST CENTURY LEADERS.  
OUR NATION S CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS, ABOVE AND BEYOND GENDER AND RACE, 
MUST BE ADDRESSED IF NAVY IS TO REMAIN RELEVANT IN THE EVOLVING AND 
HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE FOR TALENT.
DESIGNING NEW APPROACHES TO EXPAND AND TO STRENGTHEN LIFE/WORK 
INTEGRATION WHILE REMAINING TRUE TO MEETING NAVY S MISSION REQUIREMENTS 
IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS IN OUR RECRUITING AND RETENTION EFFORTS, BOTH 
TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE.
3.  IN THE NEXT YEAR, TFLW WILL FOCUS ON INITIATIVES TO ENHANCE HEALTHY 
LIFE/WORK BALANCE SUCH AS THE RECENT UPDATE TO THE PREGNANCY AND 
PARENTHOOD INSTRUCTION.  SPECIFIC TFLW TASKS INCLUDE:  EXAMINE 
INITIATIVES NAVY CAN INFLUENCE NOW THROUGH POLICY; IDENTIFY EFFORTS 
WHICH REQUIRE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OR CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL TO PLAN 
FOR LONG RANGE ENGAGEMENT; AND SOLICIT FEEDBACK FROM THE FLEET ON WHAT 
CHANGES SAILORS DESIRE FOR IMPROVED LIFE/WORK BALANCE.
4.  OVER THE COMING MONTHS, WE PLAN TO TAKE WHAT WE LEARNED DURING THE 
LIFE/WORK SUMMIT TO THE WATERFRONT TO BRIEF SAILORS AND GET THEIR 
DIRECT FEEDBACK.  YOUR THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, AND INSIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT 
TO TFLW AS FUTURE WORKFORCE POLICY IS DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED.
5.  IMPROVING LIFE/WORK BALANCE FOR OUR SAILORS MEANS RECOGNIZING THAT 
OUR SAILORS NEED AND WANT TO MAINTAIN DIVERSE INTERESTS IN ADDITION TO 
THEIR NAVY COMMITMENT.  IT DOES NOT MEAN WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE 
WHAT HAS MADE US SUCESSFUL SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE OF CHANGE OR ARE MERELY 
PURSUING  FEEL GOOD  PROGRAMS WITH NO REAL IMPACT.  BY POSITIVELY 
IMPROVING LIFE/WORK BALANCE FLEET-WIDE, WHILE CAPITALIZING ON THE BEST 
OF OUR TRADITIONS AND HERITAGE, WE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE  HOW  WE 
CONTINUE TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS, DEPLOY FORCES FORWARD, AND PREPARE OUR 
21ST CENTURY SAILORS FOR A RAPIDLY CHANGING FUTURE.  TFLW IS NOT 
LOOKING FOR THE  EASY  BUTTON FOR OUR SAILORS - IT WILL BE LOOKING FOR 
THE  BETTER  BUTTON.
