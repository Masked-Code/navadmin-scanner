Rmks/1. This NAVADMIN solicits applications for the 2024 Navy Legislative 
Fellows Program. The Legislative Fellows Program allows naval officers, 
senior enlisted, and Department of the Navy civilians to broaden their 
understanding of the legislative process and the operation of the U.S. 
Congress through a year-long, full-time assignment to the office of a 
member of the House of Representatives or the Senate.  The Legislative 
Fellows Program also enhances the ability of the Navy to fulfill its role 
in the national policy development process. 
 
2. This is a highly competitive program.  Records must reflect sustained 
superior performance and potential for future assignments in critical 
billets. 
Upon completion of the program, officers earn the Legislative Fellowship 
Additional Qualification Designation (AQD 234). 
 
3. Military Applicants.  Participation is open to all Active Duty and 
Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) unrestricted line, 
restricted line, and staff corps officers in the permanent grades of O-3 
through O-5.  Enlisted participation is open to all Active Duty Navy 
occupational specialty codes in the permanent grades of E-7 through E-9.  The 
selection process will focus on individual performance, promotion potential, 
academic and subspecialty qualifications, needs of the Navy, and availability 
for follow-on assignment. 
Officers with permanent change of station orders already issued will not be 
considered. 
   a. Applicants must be available for permanent change of station 
assignment to the Washington, DC area in November 2023. Following 
orientation at the Office of Legislative Affairs, fellows will begin 
a 12-month assignment in January 2024 in a Congressional office. 
During the Fellowship, officers and senior enlisted Sailors will be 
assigned to the Office of Legislative Affairs for administrative purposes. 
Civilian administrative control will remain with their respective command. 
In accordance with reference (b), upon execution of orders, fellows must 
agree in writing to a Service commitment of three years following completion 
or termination of the fellowship.  All officer applicants must contact their 
detailers for counseling on the career impact of participation in the 
Legislative Fellowship Program. 
   b. Submit applications via e-mail to the Office of Legislative Affairs 
point of contact no later than 12 May 2023. 
   c. Points of contact are CDR Rebeca Rodriguez, Navy Legislative Fellows 
Program Manager, who can be reached at (703) 697-2885/DSN 227 or via e-mail 
at Rebeca.S.Rodriguez.mil@us.navy.mil and LT Jacob Jepsen, Outservice 
Education Placement and Special Fellowships, PERS 443, who can be reached 
at (901) 874-3996/DSN 882 or via e-mail at Jacob.A.Jepsen.mil@us.navy.mil. 
   d. General questions on other Navy fellowship programs should be directed 
to CDR Anne Stehlin, Fellowships and Scholarships Management, OPNAV N712 at 
(571)-256-4784 or via e-mail at Anne.C.Stehlin.mil@us.navy.mil. 
 
4. Civilian Applicants.  Senior civilian employees (GM/GS-13 and above or 
equivalent) interested in the Legislative Fellowship Program must contact 
their local civilian training officer for information on submission of 
applications for the 2024 program.  Notably, civilian participation in the 
Fellowship Program differs from military requirement in that civilian 
selectees do not participate in a rotational assignment post-Fellowship and 
will return to their command and position. Civilian selectees must be able to 
report for the role in November 2023.  November and December 2023 include 
orientation at the Office of Legislative Affairs followed by 12 month 
placement in a Congressional office (January - December 2024).  Questions 
concerning Department of the Navy civilian participation should be directed 
to Ms. Sherri Hirn who can be reached at (202) 685-6493 or via e-mail at 
Sherri.A.Hirn.civ@us.navy.mil.  Additional information is available at:

representative.
