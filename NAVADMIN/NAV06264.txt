SUBJ/NATIONAL CALL TO SERVICE PROGRAM POLICY UPDATE//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM (GWOT) REQUIRES A
STRONG AND VIGOROUS NAVY RESERVE COMPONENT (RC) BUILT UPON A
FOUNDATION OF TRAINED AND EXPERIENCED JUNIOR PERSONNEL.  THE
NATIONAL CALL TO SERVICE (NCS) PROGRAM IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE
STRATEGY TO FILL THESE CRITICAL RC MANNING SHORTFALLS AND ALSO MEETS
ACTIVE COMPONENT (AC) SHORT-TERM WORK REQUIREMENTS.
2.  NCS IS AN ENLISTMENT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO SHAPE THE RESERVE FORCE
TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF GWOT.  NCS SAILORS WILL SERVE IN THE
FOLLOWING MANNER:
    A.  INITIAL TRAINING (RECRUIT TRAINING AND "A" AND/OR "C"
SCHOOL), FOLLOWED BY,
    B.  FIFTEEN MONTHS ACTIVE DUTY, FOLLOWED BY,
    C.  TWENTY FOUR MONTHS IN THE SELECTED RESERVE (SELRES).
    D.  UPON COMPLETION OF THEIR SELRES OBLIGATION, NCS SAILORS ARE
SUBJECT TO THE SAME POLICIES AS ALL OTHER NAVY VETERANS (NAVET) WITH
THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTION:  THEY MAY ELECT TO SERVE THE REMAINDER OF
THEIR MILITARY SERVICE OBLIGATION (MSO) IN A QUALIFYING NATIONAL
SERVICE PROGRAM UNDER THE GUIDELINES PUBLISHED IN MILPERSMAN
1133-080.
3.  BY TRANSITIONING THESE TRAINED AND EXPERIENCED JUNIOR PERSONNEL
FROM AC TO RC, WE ARE PROVIDING THEM A CONTINUUM OF SERVICE TO A
POSITION OF GREATER NEED.  WHILE A 24 MONTH ACTIVE DUTY EXTENSION
WOULD SATISFY THE DRILLING OBLIGATION, NCS SAILORS WILL ONLY BE
AUTHORIZED TO REMAIN ON ACTIVE DUTY WHEN IT CLEARLY SUPPORTS NAVY
TOTAL FORCE REQUIREMENTS.  EXAMPLE:  SAILORS SERVING IN UNDERMANNED
RATINGS THAT HAVE UNIQUE AND SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR GWOT.
4.  NCS SERVICE MEMBERS CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY A SPECIAL PROGRAM
INDICATOR (SPI) CODE OF Q IN COLUMN B ON THE COMMAND ENLISTED
DISTRIBUTION VERIFICATION REPORT.  EACH COMMAND SHOULD IDENTIFY
THEIR NCS SAILORS AND ENSURE THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE POLICIES
CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING REFERENCES:
    A.  MILPERSMAN 1133-080 (ESTABLISHES OVERALL PROGRAM POLICY).
    B.  NAVADMIN 192/05 (PROCEDURES FOR NCS PARTICIPANTS TO REQUEST
AN EXTENSION OF ACTIVE DUTY).
    C.  NAVADMIN 189/06 (ACTIONS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT NCS
PARTICIPANTS TRANSITIONING FROM AC TO RC).
    D.  NAVY KNOWLEDGE ONLINE (NKO) CONTAINS LINKS TO ALL REFERENCES
AND POINTS OF CONTACT.  TO OBTAIN ACCESS, LOG ONTO NKO AT
HTTPS:/WWW.NKO.NAVY.MIL AND TYPE KEYWORDS "NATIONAL CALL TO
SERVICE" IN THE NKO SEARCH ENGINE.  MEMBERS WILL THEN BE DIRECTED TO
THE APPROPRIATE LINK.
