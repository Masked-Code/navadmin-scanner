REMARKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the establishment of the FLANK SPEED 
effort and provides initial guidance for the Navy transition from the 
Department of Defense (DoD) Commercial Virtual Remote (CVR) to an enduring 
Navy Microsoft (MS) Teams cloud-based solution.  The pandemic-induced rollout 
of MS Teams in the form of the CVR not only transformed the way hundreds of 
thousands of Department of the Navy (DON) employees work, it also 
demonstrated that modern, commercial best practices can work for the Navy and 
Marine Corps.  Though CVR goes away in June 2021, the need for the workforce 
to conduct official business any time, from anywhere, and from any device 
does not.  FLANK SPEED, the named effort and the target environment via MS 
Teams, will deliver a CVR replacement.  A series of NAVADMINs will follow to 
guide users through the transition ultimately to Microsoft 365 (M365), the 
long-term Enterprise collaboration and productivity solution. 
 
2.  Beginning May 2021, the Navy will start delivering phased access to MS 
Teams in the FLANK SPEED environment to ensure continuity of collaboration 
capabilities when CVR sunsets on 15 June. 
    a.  Access to MS Teams will require an account in the FLANK SPEED 
environment; it does not require the user to be migrated to O365. 
    b.  Accounts will be provided to active CVR and NMCI O365 users first. 
    c.  Follow-on user phasing will be coordinated with Echelon II CIOs to 
meet mission requirements as network performance allows. 
 
3.  Initial MS Teams Capabilities. 
    a.  Creation of shared workspaces for audio, video, and chat.  The 
initial deployment of MS Teams will not allow for audio conferencing "dial-
in" like CVR currently supports. 
    b.  Access from Navy Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network 
(NIPRnet) and commercial internet with the following stipulations: 
        (1) Requires Common Access Card (CAC) authentication. 
        (2) Government furnished desktops/laptops will have full 
functionality when accessing from the NIPRnet, whether from the office or via 
Virtual Private Network (VPN) over a commercial internet. 
        (3) Access from commercial internet, whether by government furnished 
or personally owned desktops/laptops, requires the use of a web browser and 
data downloads will not be allowed. 
    c.  Will operate in accordance with DoD Cloud Computing Security 
Requirements Guide Impact Level 5 (IL-5).  Services with an IL-5 
authorization are able to host DoD Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) 
and National Security Systems information, to include Personal Identifiable 
Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (HIPPA). 
    d.  Ability to communicate and collaborate with other users in the DoD 
IL5 M365 environment (i.e. other Services, Combatant Commands, OSD, etc). 
 
4.  Future MS Teams Capabilities. 
    a.  FY21:  Audio Conferencing capability to allow for telephone dial-in 
to Teams meetings. 
    b.  FY22 (if approved by DoD):  Ability to communicate and collaborate 
with non-Navy users utilizing non-DoD networks (ie. contractor network). 
    c.  FY22 (if approved by DoD):  Access from personal mobile devices. 
 
5.  Users with accounts in the FLANK SPEED environment will also have access 
to OneDrive with 1 Terabyte of personal data storage.  Other features will 
become available as users are transitioned from legacy networks to the FLANK 
SPEED environment.  Additional migration details, including required user 
actions, will be promulgated separately. 
 
6.  Information and additional resources are available at 
https://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs/OPNAV/N2N6/DDCION/FlankSpeed.
