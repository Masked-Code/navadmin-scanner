SUBJ/LAUNCH OF CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS PROFESSIONAL READING PROGRAM (CNO-
PRP)//

1. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NAVY'S 237TH BIRTHDAY, THIS NAVADMIN UPDATES THE 
NEW CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS PROFESSIONAL READING PROGRAM (PRP).

2. THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN REVISED TO MAKE THE BOOKS MORE 
ACCESSIBLE TO SAILORS. SPECIFIC CHANGES INCLUDE:
A. MOVEMENT AWAY FROM RANK-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS TO A SIMPLIFIED DIVISION OF 
BOOKS INTO TWO MAIN CATEGORIES. EIGHTEEN BOOKS, CATEGORIZED AS "ESSENTIAL 
READING," WILL BE DISTRIBUTED DURING THE LAST QUARTER OF CALENDAR YEAR 2012 IN 
HARD-COPY FORMAT TO COMMANDS THROUGHOUT THE NAVY. EXISTING READING PROGRAM 
LIBRARIES SHOULD INTEGRATE THE NEW HARD-COPY TITLES INTO THEIR LEGACY 
COLLECTIONS. 24 ADDITIONAL BOOKS ARE CATEGORIZED AS "RECOMMENDED READING," AND 
AVAILABLE AS ELECTRONIC BOOKS (E-BOOKS). MANY CAN BE DOWNLOADED AT NO COST 
THROUGH THE NAVY GENERAL LIBRARY PROGRAM SITE ON NAVY KNOWLEDGE ON-LINE (NKO).
B. FOCUSING ON WARFIGHTING FIRST, OPERATE FORWARD AND BE READY, ALL BOOKS HAVE 
BEEN SELECTED BASED ON THEIR RELEVANCE TO THESE TENETS.

3. THE CNO-PRP HAS BEEN STREAMLINED TO MAKE OUR NAVY'S READING PROGRAM MORE 
INTERACTIVE, AFFORDABLE, AND WHEREVER POSSIBLE, ELECTRONICALLY ACCESSIBLE. TO 
THAT END:
A. INTERNAL CONTROL PROCEDURES SHOULD BE PUT INTO PLACE THAT WILL STRIKE THE 
APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN MAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE BOOKS AND 
MAKING THEM AVAILABLE ON A LOAN BASIS TO AS MANY SAILORS AS POSSIBLE.
B. A NUMBER OF THE TITLES WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR FREE AT THE NKO PORTAL AT 
WWWA.NKO.NAVY.MIL. CLICK ON THE REFERENCE TAB, THEN E-LIBRARY AUDIO AND E-
BOOKS TAB. IN ORDER TO DOWNLOAD BOOKS, AN "OVERDRIVE" ACCOUNT IS REQUIRED. ON 
THE TOP RIGHT, CLICK ON THE OVERDRIVE WINDOW, FOLLOW THE PROMPTS, THEN NOT 
ONLY ARE THE PRP BOOKS AVAILABLE, BUT HUNDREDS OF OTHER ITEMS. SECURITY 
RESTRICTIONS PRECLUDE DOWNLOADING VIA NAVY OWNED COMPUTERS, SO DOWNLOADING 
THEM TO PERSONALLY-OWNED DEVICES WILL BE REQUIRED.
C. FOR SAILORS WHO PREFER TO PURCHASE THEIR OWN COPIES, THE NAVY EXCHANGE 
(NEX) WILL STOCK THESE BOOKS FOR SALE IN STORES AND THEIR ON-LINE SALES SYSTEM 
AT WWW.MYNAVYEXCHANGE.COM.

4. READING, DISCUSSING, AND UNDERSTANDING THE IDEAS FOUND IN THE CNO-PRP WILL 
NOT ONLY IMPROVE OUR CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS, BUT WILL ALSO HELP US BECOME 
BETTER SAILORS, CITIZENS, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, LEADERS. THIS LIST IS NOT 
INTENDED TO LIMIT PROFESSIONAL READING IN ANY WAY, BUT MERELY TO PROVIDE EASY 
ACCESS TO A FEW OF THE MANY  TITLES THAT WILL BENEFIT OUR SERVICE. THE ENTIRE 
LIST, WITH BOOK SUMMARIES AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT 
WWW.NAVYREADING.NAVY.MIL.
THE CNO-PRP MANAGEMENT OFFICE AT THE NAVAL WAR COLLEGE CAN BE REACHED AT (401) 
841-3145 OR VIA EMAIL AT NAVYREADING(AT)USNWC.EDU. BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER, 
COMMANDS MAY WANT TO CONTACT THE PRP MANAGEMENT OFFICE TO DETERMINE IF 
ADDITIONAL NO COST BOOKS CAN BE PROVIDED FROM EXISTING INVENTORY. QUESTIONS 
AND FEEDBACK ARE WELCOMED REGARDING THE CNO-PRP, INCLUDING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 
BOOKS TO BE ADDED TO THE PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE.

5. RELEASED BY VICE ADMIRAL R. W. HUNT, DIRECTOR, NAVY STAFF.//
