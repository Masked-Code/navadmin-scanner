RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels references (a) and (b) pursuant to 
the consolidated travel guidance in reference (c).  This NAVADMIN 
additionally provides additional guidance on mission-critical travel 
for unvaccinated individuals and updates Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19) guidance for meetings. 
 
2.  Summary.  Travel and personnel movement must consider COVID-19 
related Force Health Protection (FHP) measures to protect the health 
and safety of the force, maintain mission readiness and comply with 
federal, Department of Defense (DoD), Department of the Navy (DON) 
and Host Nation (HN) guidelines.  Guidelines have adjusted over time 
due to the dynamic COVID-19 environment.  FHP measures are now 
consolidated in Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and 
Readiness (USD(PR)) guidance (reference (c)) which will be regularly 
updated as guidelines change.  This guidance should be frequently 
referenced for the latest FHP guidance on travel and personnel 
movement.  Reference (c) is available at the following website and 
all commands and organizations should monitor the website to ensure 
they review the most current version: 
https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Coronavirus-DOD-Response/Latest-DOD-
Guidance//. 
 
3.  Applicability.  This guidance applies to all Navy Service Members and 
their dependents. 
 
4.  Travel and Personnel Movement Updated Guidance and Requirements. 
The DoD conditions-based approach to COVID-19 personnel movement and 
travel (reference (d)) has been rescinded with the issuance of the 
consolidated guidance in reference (c).  The conditions-based 
approach formed the foundation of reference (a), which is cancelled 
by this NAVADMIN.  It remains paramount that personnel at all levels 
continue to ensure appropriate FHP measures are implemented and the 
risk assessment in reference (c) be completed prior to travel. 
       a.  Reference (c) contains detailed guidance on travel for 
service members and their dependents, as well as DoD civilians and 
contractors, and bases the guidance on location of travel and 
whether the travel is official or unofficial.  It also provides 
testing and restriction of movement requirements.  That guidance 
should be followed unless more restrictive Navy specific guidance is 
provided.  The guidance in reference (b), which is cancelled by this 
NAVADMIN, is replaced with the testing guidance in reference (c). 
During all official travel, travelers will follow all applicable 
federal, state, local and commercial air carrier requirements and 
applicable HN requirements. 
       b.  Specific guidance for personnel movement for Navy 
operational units is contained in reference (e). 
 
5.  Official travel for fully vaccinated individuals.  In line with 
reference (c), fully vaccinated individuals are not restricted from 
official travel, both domestic and international. 
 
6.  Official travel for individuals not fully vaccinated. 
Individuals who are not fully vaccinated, or who decline to provide 
information about their vaccination status, are limited to only 
mission-critical official travel, both domestic and international. 
In any case, travel of unvaccinated individuals should be minimized. 
Requests for official travel by unvaccinated personnel outside of 
the following categories will be routed to the Under Secretary of 
the Navy (UNSECNAV) for decision via the Chief of Naval Personnel 
(CNP), the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Assistant 
Secretary of the Navy for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (ASN MRA). 
In line with reference (f), official travel by unvaccinated 
personnel, or those who decline to provide information about their 
vaccination status, is only authorized for the following mission 
critical purposes: 
       a.  Permanent Change of Station (PCS) travel for dependents 
accompanying Service Members or civilian employees who are fully 
vaccinated or have a permanently approved exemption.  Overseas 
screening and medical approval is still required per current 
policies. 
       b.  PCS travel for unvaccinated Service Members reassigned 
from operational units to non-deployable units.  Unvaccinated 
dependents of these Service Members are also authorized to travel. 
       c.  Travel of dependents associated with an approved early 
return of dependents authorization from an overseas post or station. 
       d.  Government funded emergency leave travel and emergency 
visitation travel. 
       e.  New recruits traveling to Recruit Training Command. 
       f.  Travel by patients, as well as their authorized escorts 
and attendants, for purposes of medical treatment.  Travel by 
medical providers for the purposes of medical treatment for DoD 
personnel and their families. 
       g.  Travel by Service Members and civilian personnel approved 
for retirement or separation.  For Service Members, travel is 
authorized for purposes of taking transition leave. 
       h.  Travel by Service Members under the authority of a Chief 
of Mission and authorized by that Chief of Mission. 
       i.  Travel by Service Members and civilian personnel not under 
the authority of a Chief of Mission and ordered by the appropriate 
DoD official to evacuate an area threatened by unusual or emergency 
circumstances. 
       j.  Travel associated with new civilian hiring and management 
directed actions to include transfers, reassignments, management 
directed reassignments and new civilian accessions including formal 
entry-level civilian accession programs such as government-funded 
internships and fellowships. 
       k.  Travel by civilian employees complying with overseas tour 
rotation agreement requirements. 
       l.  Travel in support of mission critical maintenance 
operations for DON assets as well as the critical assets of other 
services, agencies, and international partnerships that support the 
mission of the DON.  Mission critical maintenance operations are in 
direct support of DON ships, submarines, aircraft, information 
technology equipment and infrastructure as well as other critical 
equipment not otherwise listed. 
       m.  Travel by Service Members from an overseas post or station 
that are not eligible for involuntary extension or will surpass the 
180-day limit for involuntary extension. 
 
7.  Updated COVID-19 Guidance Related to Meetings. 
     a.  In line with reference (c), approval must be obtained in 
advance for any planned, in-person meetings, events and conferences 
sponsored by the DON with more than 50 participants (referred to 
collectively herein as *meetings*, in a county or equivalent 
jurisdiction where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) COVID-19 Community Level is high.  Approval authority is the 
UNSECNAV and no lower.  All organizations within the Navy will 
submit requests through the respective chain of command to the 
UNSECNAV for approval via ASN (MRA).  To the maximum extent 
practicable, requests should be submitted no later than 30 days from 
the planned start of the event to allow for proper coordination and 
routing. 
    b.  For any in-person meetings in a county or equivalent 
jurisdiction where the CDC COVID-19 Community Level is high or 
medium, the meeting organizer will require all attendees, including 
Service Members and DoD civilian employees, to show a completed DD 
Form 3150, *Contractor Personnel and Visitor Certification of 
Vaccination.*  In extenuating circumstances, the UNSECNAV may 
approve exceptions for attendees who are not vaccinated.  These 
exceptions will be requested through the respective chain of command 
to the UNSECNAV for approval via ASN (MRA).  Organizers of approved 
meetings will require attendees to confirm proof of vaccination and, 
where exceptions are granted, organizers will ensure that 
unvaccinated attendees meet the testing provisions of reference (c). 
All attendees will remain in compliance with the masking guidance 
within reference (g). 
    c.  For purposes of this guidance, meetings do not include 
military training, exercise events and operations.  In addition, 
private social events at Morale, Welfare and Recreation facilities 
or events held as part of DoD Educational Activity schools functions 
on naval installations do not constitute meetings. 
 
8.  It is incumbent on personnel at all levels of the Navy to take 
personal ownership of continuing to effectively implement FHP 
measures and ensure they are seeking out and following the latest 
guidance. 
 
9.  Points of contact.  Service Members with PCS questions should 
contact their detailer directly or through the MyNavy Career Center.
