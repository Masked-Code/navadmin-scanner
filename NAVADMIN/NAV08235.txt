RMKS/1.  THIS IS THE THIRD MESSAGE IN A SERIES UPDATING NAVY 
CONTINGENCY MANPOWER BUSINESS RULES.  REF A PROVIDED AN UPDATE TO THE 
INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION MANPOWER MANAGEMENT (IAMM) PROCESS AND BUSINESS 
RULES.  REF B ADDRESSED THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR (GWOT) SUPPORT 
ASSIGNMENTS (GSA) DETAILING PROCESS.  THIS MESSAGE UPDATES NAVY'S RC 
MOBILIZATION BUSINESS RULES ORIGINALLY PROMULGATED IN REF C.  THESE 
REVISED BUSINESS RULES ARE BASED ON STAKEHOLDER INPUT, CURRENT BUSINESS 
PRACTICES, AND OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
(OSD) POLICY.  FULL TIME SUPPORT (FTS) SAILORS WILL COMPLY WITH ACTIVE 
COMPONENT (AC) INDIVIDUAL MANPOWER MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE PER REF A AND 
GSA DETAILING GUIDANCE PER REF B.
2.  OVER 50,000 RC SAILORS HAVE MOBILIZED TO SUPPORT THE GWOT SINCE 9-
11.  THEIR IMPRESSIVE CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDE DIRECT ACTION, COMBAT 
SUPPORT, AND COMBAT SERVICE SUPPORT.  RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT THIS 
SERVICE HAS ON OUR SAILORS, THE NAVY'S GOAL IS TO PROVIDE OUR SAILORS - 
BOTH ACTIVE AND RESERVE - WITH AS MUCH STRUCTURE AND PREDICTABILITY IN 
THIS PROCESS AS POSSIBLE.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT WITHIN OUR RC 
WHERE OUR SAILORS BALANCE RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE NAVY, THEIR FAMILIES, 
AND THEIR CIVILIAN EMPLOYERS.  
3.  ALL SAILORS WHO ARE MOBILIZED IN SUPPORT OF GWOT ASSIGNMENTS WILL 
BE ISSUED INVOLUNTARY ORDERS PURSUANT TO TITLE 10, U.S. CODE, SECTION 
12302 AUTHORITY.  THE NAVY REQUIREMENT FOR NOTIFICATION FOR INVOLUNTARY 
MOBILIZATION IS A MINIMUM OF 60 DAYS WITH THE GOAL OF 180 DAYS 
NOTIFICATION.  INVOLUNTARY MOBILIZATIONS WITH LESS THAN 60 DAYS NOTICE 
WILL ONLY BE CONSIDERED IF THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT READINESS IMPACT 
TO THE MISSION AS DETERMINED BY U.S. FLEET FORCES (USFF).  TO MOBILIZE 
A MEMBER WHO IS NOT A VOLUNTEER WITHIN THE 60-DAY WINDOW, REQUESTS TO 
WAIVE 60-DAY NOTIFICATION MUST BE SUBMITTED TO CHIEF OF NAVAL PERSONNEL 
VIA USFF AND NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (NPC).  SPECIFIC GUIDANCE IS 
PROVIDED LATER IN THIS NAVADMIN.  
FOR MEMBERS WHO VOLUNTEER TO MOBILIZE IN THEIR DWELL TIME, NPC REQUIRES 
A COPY OF THE SIGNED VOLUNTEER ACKNOWLEDGMENT FORM BEFORE GENERATION OF 
INVOLUNTARY TITLE 10, U.S. CODE, SECTION 12302 MOBILIZATION ORDERS.  
THE VOLUNTEER ACKNOWLEDGMENT FORM IS LOCATED AT 
WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/CAREERINFO/AUGMENTATION/PERS4G1/.
4.  THE FOLLOWING ARE THE NAVY RESERVE MOBILIZATION BUSINESS RULES AND 
DEFINITIONS:
    A.  RC CAPACITY.  RC CAPACITY IS THE NUMBER OF RC PERSONNEL 
AVAILABLE FOR MOBILIZATION PER REF D AND CURRENT OSD AND SECRETARY OF 
THE NAVY (SECNAV) MOBILIZATION POLICIES.  PERSONNEL IN RC UNITS 
IDENTIFIED FOR UNIT LEVEL MOBILIZATION ARE EXCLUDED FROM IA CAPACITY 
CALCULATIONS.  USFF, AS NAVY'S GLOBAL FORCE MANAGER (GFM), WILL 
MAINTAIN A LIST OF EXCLUDED UNITS.  LIMITED SUPPLY/HIGH DEMAND
(LS/HD) SKILL SET COMMUNITY MANAGERS WILL PROPOSE TO NPC AND USFF GFM 
COMMUNITY-SPECIFIC BUSINESS RULES TO ESTABLISH RC CAPACITY IN LS/HD 
SKILL SETS.  
    B.  MOBILIZATION EMPLOYMENT PERIOD (MEP).  PER REF E, MEP IS 
DEFINED AS THE TOTAL PERIOD OF INVOLUNTARY (TITLE 10, U.S. CODE, 
SECTION 12302) ACTIVE DUTY, LESS ANY INDIVIDUAL SKILL TRAINING AND 
POST-DEPLOYMENT LEAVE.  OVERALL TIME ACTIVATED, INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL 
SKILL TRAINING AND POST-MOBILIZATION LEAVE OR ABSENCES, MAY EXCEED 12 
MONTHS IN DURATION.  PER REF F, INDIVIDUAL SKILL TRAINING IS DEFINED AS 
INDIVIDUAL SPECIALTY AND PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION 
(INSTITUTIONAL) TRAINING REQUIRED FOR INDIVIDUAL BILLET AND/OR 
ADDITIONAL DUTY QUALIFICATIONS FOR DEPLOYMENT.  THE INTENT OF THIS 
TRAINING IS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM REQUIRED 
SPECIALTY TASKS FOR DEPLOYMENT AND IS USUALLY DEFINED AS ANY TRAINING 
THAT RESULTS IN THE ISSUANCE OF A NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION (NEC) 
CODE OR ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATION DESIGNATOR (AQD) CODE.  NAVY 
INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE COMBAT TRAINING (NIACT) IS CONSIDERED INDIVIDUAL 
TRAINING AND IS NOT COUNTED TOWARD MEP.  VOLUNTARY ORDERS, AS DEFINED 
IN TITLE 10, U.S. CODE, SECTION 12301(D)(E.G. VOLUNTARY CONTINGENCY 
RECALL OR ACTIVE DUTY FOR SPECIAL WORK (ADSW)) ARE CONSIDERED DWELL 
TIME AND DO NOT INCUR A 1:5 RATIO FOLLOWING DEMOBILIZATION.  FOLLOW ON 
VOLUNTARY ORDERS DO NOT ADD TO OR RESTART THE DWELL PERIOD EARNED 
DURING INVOLUNTARY MOBILIZATION. 
    C.  MOBILIZATION FOR TRAINING (MFT).  PER REF E, MOBILIZATION FOR 
TRAINING IS A TRAINING EVENT (PERFORMED PURSUANT TO TITLE 10, U.S. CODE, 
SECTION 12302) THAT PRODUCES AN AQD/NEC CODE OR ADDITIONAL SKILL 
QUALIFIER.  ALTHOUGH THIS DUTY IS INVOLUNTARY, IT SHALL NOT BE COUNTED 
AS A MOBILIZATION EMPLOYMENT PERIOD FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF:  (1) 
CALCULATING DWELL TIME, AND (2) APPLYING THE DEMOBILIZATION INACTIVE 
DUTY TRAINING (IDT) AND ANNUAL TRAINING (AT) TRAINING RESTRICTIONS 
PRESCRIBED IN SUBPARA 1.T OF REF F.  THE INTENT OF THIS TRAINING IS TO 
PROVIDE A SPECIALTY-QUALIFIED MEMBER TO A UNIT FOR FUTURE MOBILIZATION, 
AND NOT TO PERFORM COMMON TASKS OR TYPE FUNCTIONAL TRAINING SUCH AS 
DRIVER'S TRAINING, COMBAT LIFESAVER'S TRAINING, WEAPONS QUALIFICATION, 
ETC.  REF G PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR THE UTILIZATION OF MFT LEGISLATION 
WHEN ORDERING U.S. NAVY RC PERSONNEL TO ACTIVE DUTY.
    D.  NAVY RESERVE DWELL TIME.  PER REF F, THE PLANNING OBJECTIVE FOR 
INVOLUNTARY MOBILIZATION (TITLE 10, U.S. CODE, SECTION 12302) ORDERS IS 
A MAXIMUM OF ONE YEAR MEP TO FIVE YEARS DEMOBILIZED (1:5 RATIO).  THE 
1:5 RATIO APPLIES TO MOBILIZATIONS LESS THAN ONE YEAR AS WELL.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, IF A MEMBER OR UNIT IS MOBILIZED FOR EIGHT MONTHS, POLICY 
PROVIDES A MINIMUM OF 40 MONTHS DWELL TIME BEFORE MEMBER OR UNIT CAN BE 
INVOLUNTARILY RECALLED AGAIN, MAINTAINING THE
1:5 RATIO.  HOWEVER, DEMAND FOR CERTAIN MISSION CRITICAL SKILL SETS MAY 
REQUIRE A NUMBER OF UNITS AND/OR INDIVIDUALS TO BE REMOBILIZED SOONER 
THAN THIS STANDARD.  SERVICE SECRETARIES MAY AUTHORIZE UP TO A
1:4 RATIO FOR THOSE MISSION CRITICAL SKILL SETS.  ANY REQUEST TO 
INVOLUNTARILY MOBILIZE INDIVIDUALS INSIDE OF 1:4 DWELL REQUIRES 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (SECDEF) APPROVAL.  USFF WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS 
TO OPNAV ON STRESSED COMMUNITIES THAT WARRANT WAIVER CONSIDERATION.  
OPNAV N3 AUGMENTATION CELL WILL PURSUE WAIVER APPROVAL AND COMMUNICATE 
DWELL WAIVERS RECEIVED TO USFF, CNPC AND COMMANDER NAVY RESERVE FORCES 
COMMAND (CNRFC).  THE MEP FOR ANY MOBILIZATION SHALL NOT EXCEED 12 
MONTHS AND THE MAXIMUM DWELL PERIOD FOR AN INVOLUNTARY MOBILIZATION IS 
FIVE YEARS.
    E.  DWELL TIME ACCOUNTING.  OFFICIAL DWELL TIME IS THE NUMBER OF 
MEP DAYS TIMES FIVE.  CNRFC IS THE AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE TO CALCULATE 
OFFICIAL DWELL TIME VIA THE RESERVE HEADQUARTERS SYSTEM (RHS).  SAILORS 
WHO HAVE THE INDIVIDUAL MOBILIZATION STATUS (IMS) CODE OF "RDA" IN RHS 
HAVE COMPLETED DWELL TIME FROM A PREVIOUS MOBILIZATION.  SPECIFIC 
REQUESTS FOR INTERPRETATION ON DWELL TIME ACCOUNTING AND MEP SHOULD BE 
REFERRED TO CNRFC VIA THE MEMBER'S NAVY OPERATIONAL SUPPORT CENTER 
(NOSC).  DD-214S AND COPIES OF MOBILIZATION ORDERS ARE TOOLS THAT CAN 
BE USED TO DETERMINE DWELL TIME.  SAILORS CAN APPROXIMATE THEIR DWELL 
TIME BY MULTIPLYING THE LENGTH OF THEIR PREVIOUS INVOLUNTARY 
MOBILIZATION BY FIVE.  EXAMPLE:  A SAILOR IS MOBILIZED FOR 233 DAYS.  
DWELL TIME FOR THAT SAILOR IS 233 X 5=1165 DAYS.  FOR RC UNIT 
COMMANDERS, DWELL STATUS FOR INDIVIDUAL SAILORS CAN BE OBTAINED FROM 
THE SUPPORTING NOSC.  
    F.  POST-MOBILIZATION RESPITE ABSENCE.  COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF 
RESPITE ABSENCES (NON-CHARGEABLE ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE) MAY BE AVAILABLE 
TO SAILORS WHO COMPLETE MORE THAN 12 MONTHS OF INVOLUNTARY MOBILIZATION 
OR TO SAILORS WHO ARE MOBILIZED A SECOND TIME BEFORE THEIR 1:5 DWELL 
RATIO IS COMPLETE.  POLICY GUIDANCE ON QUALIFICATIONS FOR RESPITE 
ABSENCES IS PROVIDED IN REF H.   
    G.  NOTIFICATION TIME.  REF I ESTABLISHED A GOAL TO PROVIDE ALERTS 
UP TO 24 MONTHS AND MOBILIZATION ORDER APPROVAL 180 DAYS PRIOR TO 
MOBILIZATION.  WITHIN THESE STATED GOALS, MILITARY DEPARTMENT 
SECRETARIES (MILDEPSECS) MAY APPROVE ALERT/MOBILIZATION REQUESTS AS 
FOLLOWS PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY STATED MEP AND DWELL RATIOS ARE MET:
        (1) FOR CONVENTIONAL FORCE COMMISSIONED UNITS IF 90 OR MORE 
DAYS BETWEEN MOBILIZATION APPROVAL AND THE MOBILIZATION DATE ARE 
PROVIDED.  
        (2) FOR IA'S, INDIVIDUALS FILLING AD HOC REQUIREMENTS, 
INDIVIDUAL FILLERS, MOBILIZATION FOR TRAINING, AND MEDICAL 
PROFESSIONALS IF 30 OR MORE DAYS BETWEEN MOBILIZATION APPROVAL AND THE 
MOBILIZATION DATE ARE PROVIDED.  (NOTE: THE NAVY REQUIREMENT OF 60 DAYS 
NOTIFICATION REMAINS IN EFFECT.  OPERATIONAL NEED MAY RESULT IN SOME 
SAILORS RECEIVING LESS THAN 60 DAYS NOTIFICATION.  SAILORS MOBILIZED TO 
FILL MISSION ESSENTIAL, EMERGENT REQUIREMENTS WILL BE GIVEN THE MAXIMUM 
NOTIFICATION TIME POSSIBLE.)  
        (3) NOTIFICATION DATE IS ESTABLISHED AS THE DATE OF THE 
MOBILIZATION ORDERS.  THE NOTIFICATION PERIOD IS MEASURED FROM THE 
DATE-TIME-GROUP (DTG) OF THE ORDERS TO THE FIRST INTERMEDIATE-STOP (I-
STOP), WHICH IS NORMALLY THE NOSC FOR MOBILIZING RESERVISTS. 
        (4) WHILE 60 DAYS IS THE NOTIFICATION STANDARD, RESERVISTS 
SHALL BE PREPARED TO REPORT WITHIN 72 HOURS FOR MOBILIZATION.  TO 
ENSURE THAT REPORTING TIMES ARE MET, MEMBERS SHALL ARRANGE IN ADVANCE 
THE HANDLING OF FAMILY, PERSONAL, BUSINESS, AND OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES.
        (5)  SAILORS MAY WAIVE THE NOTIFICATION MINIMUMS FOR VOLUNTARY 
OR INVOLUNTARY MOBILIZATIONS.
    H.  VOLUNTEERING FOR MOBILIZATION.
        (1) CNRFC UTILIZES VOLUNTEERS TO FILL MOBILIZATION REQUIREMENTS 
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE.  MOBILIZATION OPPORTUNITY ANNOUNCEMENTS 
ARE DISSEMINATED VIA EMAIL TO SOLICIT VOLUNTEERS FOR SPECIFIC MISSIONS, 
PARTICULARLY SHORT NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.  MOB OPPORTUNITIES ARE ALSO 
POSTED ON THE CNRFC WEBSITE NAVYRESERVE.NAVY.MIL UNDER LINKS.
        (2) SAILORS WHO DESIRE TO VOLUNTEER FOR MOBILIZATION ARE 
ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT THEIR NOSC AND HAVE THEIR MANPOWER AVAILABILITY 
STATUS (MAS) CODES UPDATED TO A VOLUNTEER STATUS (VOL).  THIS WILL 
REGISTER THEM AS A MOBILIZATION VOLUNTEER.  SAILORS SHOULD THEN EMAIL 
CNRFC_MOBVOL(AT)NAVY.MIL TO COMMUNICATE PREFERENCES CONCERNING 
TIMEFRAME, LOCATION, AND MISSION.  RC SAILORS WHO HAVE INDICATED THEIR 
WILLINGNESS TO VOLUNTEER IN THE PAST MUST UPDATE THEIR MAS CODE 
PERIODICALLY SO AS NOT TO INADVERTENTLY INDICATE A WILLINGNESS TO 
VOLUNTEER WHEN THEIR PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED.
        (3) MEMBERS VOLUNTEERING FOR MOBILIZATION REQUIREMENTS WITH 
LESS THAN 60 DAYS NOTICE MUST SIGN THE 60-DAY NOTIFICATION WAIVER FORM.  
IF THE REASON FOR LESS THAN 60 DAYS NOTIFICATION IS EITHER
(1) MEMBER IS A REPLACEMENT FOR AN UNPLANNED LOSS, (2) MEMBER IS 
VOLUNTEERING TO FILL AN EMERGENT REQUIREMENT OR (3) MEMBER RECENTLY 
DEMOBILIZED BUT VOLUNTEERS TO BE RECALLED AGAIN TO SUPPORT GWOT, THEN 
THE SIGNED FORM CAN BE SENT DIRECTLY TO NPC.  IN ALL OTHER CASES, THE 
60-DAY WAIVER REQUEST MUST BE REVIEWED AND ENDORSED BY USFF AND NPC.  
WAIVER REQUESTS MUST BE RECEIVED BY NPC NO LESS THAN THREE WORKING DAYS 
PRIOR TO DESIRED COMMENCEMENT DATE OF ORDERS.  THE 60-DAY NOTIFICATION 
WAIVER FORM IS LOCATED AT 
WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/CAREERINFO/AUGMENTATION/PERS4G1/.
    I.  MEDICAL SCREENING AND DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS.  
        (1) MOBILIZATION AND DEPLOYABILITY REQUIREMENTS
            (A) RC MEMBERS SHOULD BE IN A FULLY MEDICALLY READY STATUS 
AT ALL TIMES.  DETAILED MEDICAL READINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR MOBILIZATION 
AND SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES ARE OUTLINED IN REF J.  
THE NOSC MEDICAL DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVE (MDR) WILL SCREEN THE HEALTH 
AND DENTAL RECORD WITHIN TWO WORKING DAYS OF RECEIPT OF MOBILIZATION 
ORDERS TO IDENTIFY ANY POTENTIAL DEPLOYMENT LIMITING CONDITIONS.  
            (B) QUESTIONS REGARDING A MEMBER'S MEDICAL SUITABILITY FOR 
DEPLOYMENT SHOULD BE DISCUSSED WITH A CREDENTIALED MILITARY PROVIDER 
FOR DISPOSITION.  IF FURTHER EVALUATION IS REQUIRED, A REFERRAL TO A 
MILITARY TREATMENT FACILITY (MTF) PROVIDER MAY BE NECESSARY.  THE NPC 
PERS-95 SENIOR MEDICAL OFFICER MAY BE CONTACTED (SEE PARA 6) BY THE MTF 
PROVIDERS FOR CONSULTATION.  THE NOSC WILL CONTACT THE CNRFC 
MOBILIZATION OFFICER IMMEDIATELY TO REPORT SERVICE MEMBERS IDENTIFIED 
AS UNABLE TO DEPLOY. 
            (C) SAILORS WHO ARE FOUND UNFIT FOR MOBILIZATION DURING 
NMPS IN-PROCESSING OR SAILORS WHO ARE ASSIGNED MEDICAL HOLD OR MEDICAL 
EVALUATION ORDERS MAY SUBSEQUENTLY BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A MEDICAL 
RETENTION REVIEW (MRR) PACKAGE PER REF K, AND/OR BE PLACED IN PHYSICAL 
RISK CATEGORY "B" IN THE INACTIVE MANPOWER AND PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 
INFORMATION SYSTEM (IMAPMIS) BY NPC FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR.
        (2) REF L ADDRESSES DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS.  
    J.  NMPS LEVEL LOADING:  NPC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NMPS LEVEL LOADING 
AND NIACT QUOTA CONTROL.  LEVEL LOADING IS PROJECTED WELL IN ADVANCE 
AND IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE NMPS CAPACITY IS NOT EXCEEDED.  THE NMPS 
LISTED ON THE MEMBER'S ORDERS IS THE APPROVED LOCATION.  REQUESTS FOR 
CHANGE TO AN ALTERNATE NMPS ARE DISCOURAGED AND WILL NOT NORMALLY BE 
APPROVED.
    K.  CHANGES TO ORDERS:  IF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ORDERS ARE 
REQUIRED (GREATER THAN 30-DAY IMPACT ON REPORTING FOR OR DETACHING FROM 
ACTIVE DUTY), THE FOLLOWING WILL OCCUR:
        (1) IF A REQUIREMENT IS CANCELLED AFTER ORDERS HAVE BEEN ISSUED, 
BUT PRIOR TO THE NOSC REPORT DATE, THE MEMBER WILL NOT HAVE THE OPTION 
TO SEEK REASSIGNMENT, BUT MAY VOLUNTEER FOR A SUBSEQUENT MOBILIZATION 
PENDING AVAILABILITY BY CONTACTING CNRFC N35 MOB CELL (SEE PARA 4). 
        (2) IF A REQUIREMENT IS CANCELLED AFTER THE MEMBER HAS REPORTED 
FOR OR COMPLETED TRAINING, EXPEDITIONARY COMBAT READINESS CENTER 
(ECRC)/CNRFC/USFF WILL EVALUATE OPTIONS FOR REASSIGNMENT OF THE MEMBER 
TO ANOTHER MOBILIZATION REQUIREMENT.
        (3) INCREASES TO BILLET TOUR LENGTHS RESULTING FROM A 
REQUIREMENT REVALIDATION WILL NORMALLY BE REFLECTED IN SUBSEQUENT 
ROTATIONS OF THE BILLET.  ASSIGNED IA TOUR COMPLETION DATES WILL 
NORMALLY NOT BE ADJUSTED.  WHEN AN ADJUSTMENT IS REQUIRED FOR AN 
INVOLUNTARY EXTENSION, THE REQUEST FOR APPROVAL WILL BE INITIATED BY 
THE MEMBER'S COMMAND AND FORWARDED TO USFF WHO WILL COORDINATE WITH 
OPNAV AND NPC FOR SECDEF APPROVAL.
        (4) MEMBERS MAY VOLUNTEER TO EXTEND UNDER TITLE 10, U.S. 
CODE, SECTION 12302 (INVOLUNTARY) AUTHORITY SUBJECT TO SUPPORTED 
COMMAND APPROVAL AND MOBILIZATION REQUIREMENT EXPIRATION DATE; HOWEVER, 
TOTAL TIME SERVED UNDER INVOLUNTARY AUTHORITY WILL BE LIMITED TO 730 
CONSECUTIVE DAYS PER REF D.  ORDER EXTENSIONS BEYOND 730 CONSECUTIVE 
DAYS WILL BE ISSUED UNDER TITLE 10, U.S. CODE, SECTION 12301D 
(VOLUNTARY) AUTHORITY.  SAILORS DESIRING TO EXTEND SHOULD COMMUNICATE 
THAT DESIRE TO THEIR CHAIN OF COMMAND IN A TIMELY MANNER-NORMALLY FOUR 
TO SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE END OF CURRENT ORDERS.  
SAILORS DESIRING TO EXTEND MUST COMPLETE THE VOLUNTARY SERVICE 
AGREEMENT LOCATED AT WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/CAREERINFO/AUGMENTATION/PERS4G1/.  
ORDER MODIFICATIONS TO CHANGE TITLE 10 AUTHORITY SHALL NOT BE MADE 
RETROACTIVE TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS NAVADMIN.
   L.  THE NAVY IS COMMITTED TO FINDING THE BEST BALANCE BETWEEN 
MISSION ACCOMPLISHMENT, SAILOR NOTIFICATION, FAMILY NEEDS, AND COMMAND 
READINESS.  UNANTICIPATED DEMANDS MAY REQUIRE TAILORED SOLUTIONS NOT 
COVERED IN THESE BUSINESS RULES.
5.  MOBILIZATION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE POSTED TO THE NPC 
MOBILIZATION POLICY WEB SITE 
WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/CAREERINFO/AUGMENTATION/MOBILIZATION/.  PROCEDURES,
