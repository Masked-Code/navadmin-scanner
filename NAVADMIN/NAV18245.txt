RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the FY-18 flight hour verification process 
for conditional Aviation Incentive Pay (AvIP) and Hazardous Duty Incentive 
Pay for Flying (HDIP-F).  In line with reference (a), all recipients of 
conditional AvIP or HDIP-F are required to track flight hours per month, and 
report them to Commander, Navy Personnel Command (COMNAVPERSCOM) AvIP Program 
Manager (PERS-435).  Commanding officers and other reporting seniors are 
responsible for verifying the accuracy and completeness of flight hour 
verification letters for officers under their charge, and reporting such by 
endorsing verification letters on command letterhead.  Templates for the 
reporting senior endorsement, as well as an example of the verification 
letter, can be found on the COMNAVPERSCOM website at
http://www.npc.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/Detailing/aviation/OCM/Pages/ACIP.aspx.

2.  Conditional AvIP may be paid to those aeronautically designated officers 
in the following categories:
    a.  Aeromedical officers.
    b.  Aviation officers who would otherwise be eligible for continuous AvIP 
but have not met the months of operational flying requirements at the 12-year 
or 18-year gate.
    c.  Aviation officers, O-6 and below, who have completed the continuous 
AvIP program after 22 years (after passing the 18-year low gate) or 25 years 
(after passing the 18-year high gate).

3.  In order to be eligible for conditional AvIP, an officer must be under 
orders to Duty in a Flying Status Involving Operational or Training Flights 
(DIFOPS), must occupy a billet designated XXX1 or
XXX2 (a DIFOPS billet) and must fly the minimum hours prescribed in reference 
(b).

4.  HDIP-F may be paid to non-aeronautically designated officers and 
aeronautically designated flag officers required by competent orders to 
participate in regular and frequent aerial flights as crew or non-
crewmembers.  HDIP-F eligibility requires a non-aeronautically designated 
officer to be under orders to duty involving flying as a technical observer.  
An aeronautically designated flag officer must be under DIFOPS orders to 
maintain HDIP-F eligibility.  All must fly the minimum hours prescribed in 
reference (b).  Officers entitled to AvIP are not entitled to HDIP-F.

5.  Any officer who received any conditional AvIP or HDIP-F payment during 
FY-18 is required to provide total flight hours, by month, from 1 October 
2017 through 30 September 2018 to PERS-435 no later than 31 December 2018.  
Required format for flight hour submissions and commanding officer 
endorsement letters are provided in the templates located on the NPC website 
at
http://www.npc.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/Detailing/aviation/OCM/Pages/AvIP.aspx.  If a member did not 
complete the minimum flight hour requirements as established in reference 
(b), unearned AvIP/HDIP-F will be recouped.  Underpayments will also be 
corrected.  If no flight hours are submitted by
31 December 2018, the entitlement of the officer to AvIP or HDIP-F will stop 
and he or she will forfeit the entire FY-18 entitlement to conditional AvIP 
or HDIP-F.  The repayment process of the AvIP received will be initiated as 
applicable.  It is the responsibility of each individual recipient of 
conditional AvIP/HDIP-F to ensure that the flight hour verification letter 
and endorsement are completed in line with reference (a), to deliver them on 
time by mail/e-mail/fax to PERS-435, and to verify that they have been 
received by PERS-435 (see e-mail contacts below).

6.  Members shall send original flight hour submissions and command 
endorsements by mail to:
    Commander, Navy Personnel Command
    PERS-435
    5720 Integrity Drive
    Millington, TN 38055-4300
Submission of backup copies by e-mail is strongly encouraged to ensure 
receipt by PERS-435, but hardcopy of the original documents must be submitted 
to the address above.  E-mail submissions should be made to the program 
manager at avipandavb(at)navy.mil.  If e-mail is not possible, please fax 
submissions to (901) 874-2721/2756, attention PERS-435.

7.  Once flight hours are received, verification of hours flown and monthly 
entitlement(s) earned will be calculated by PERS-435.
Overpayment and underpayment cases will be forwarded to Defense Financing and 
Accounting Service for appropriate corrective action.
Negotiation of repayment plans for recoupment may be discussed directly with 
the servicing personnel support detachment of the member.

8.  Point of contact for AvIP and HDIP-F policy is LT Christopher Jenkins 
(PERS-435), at (901) 874-3953/DSN 882 or via e-mail at 
avipandavb(at)navy.mil.

9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled.
