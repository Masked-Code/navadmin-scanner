1.  THIS IS THE SECOND IN A SERIES OF COMMUNICATIONS CONCERNING THE REPEAL OF 
SECTION 654 OF TITLE 10, KNOWN AS "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" (DADT).  AS NOTED IN 
REFERENCE A, THE CURRENT DADT POLICY REMAINS IN EFFECT.  NO POLICIES, 
REGULATIONS, OR BENEFITS WILL CHANGE PRIOR TO FINAL REPEAL.  FINAL REPEAL WILL 
NOT BE EFFECTIVE UNTIL 60 DAYS AFTER THE PRESIDENT, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, AND 
CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS CERTIFY TO CONGRESS THAT REPEAL CAN BE MADE IN A 
MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARDS OF MILITARY READINESS, MILITARY 
EFFECTIVENESS, UNIT COHESION, AND RECRUITING AND RETENTION OF THE ARMED 
FORCES.

2.  THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS ACTIVELY PREPARING FOR FINAL REPEAL.  THE 
SERVICES, IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, 
ARE ENGAGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR ALL HANDS.  
WITHIN OUR NAVY, I HAVE DESIGNATED COMMANDER, U.S. FLEET FORCES COMMAND (USFF) 
AS THE EXECUTIVE AGENT FOR TRAINING DELIVERY AND TRACKING AND OPNAV (N1) AS 
THE EXECUTIVE AGENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONTENT.  SPECIFICS OF THIS TASKING 
WILL BE PROVIDED VIA SEPARATE CORRESPONDENCE.

3.  TRAINING WILL BE PROVIDED TO ALL ACTIVE AND RESERVE PERSONNEL, NAVY 
CIVILIANS WHO SUPERVISE MILITARY PERSONNEL, AND DOD CONTRACTORS, AS REQUIRED 
BY THEIR POSITION AND RESPONSIBILITIES, PRIOR TO REPEAL.  WE WILL USE A TIERED 
APPROACH TO ENSURE ALL PERSONNEL WILL RECEIVE THE NECESSARY LEVEL OF TRAINING.  
TIER LEVELS WILL INCLUDE:  
    A.  TIER 1:  TRAINING FOR EXPERTS WHO MAY DEAL FREQUENTLY WITH REPEAL 
ISSUES (CHAPLAINS, JUDGE ADVOCATES, MILITARY LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL, FLEET 
AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTER PERSONNEL, PERSONNEL SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS, EQUAL 
OPPORTUNITY ADVISORS, RECRUITERS, SENIOR HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICERS, AND PUBLIC 
AFFAIRS OFFICERS). COMMUNITY LEADERS OF THESE DISCIPLINES WILL HELP DEVELOP 
AND DELIVER THE REQUIRED TRAINING.
    B.  TIER 2:  TRAINING FOR SENIOR LEADERS AND COMMAND LEADERSHIP 
(CO/XO/CMC) TO PREPARE THEM TO EDUCATE AND TRAIN THEIR COMMANDS.    
    C.  TIER 3:  TRAINING FOR ALL HANDS, WHICH INCLUDES THE ACTIVE FORCE, 
RESERVE FORCE, AND THOSE CIVILIANS WHO SUPERVISE MILITARY PERSONNEL.  THIS 
TRAINING WILL EMPHASIZE POLICIES AND EXPECTATIONS OF PERSONAL BEHAVIOR. 

4.  U.S. FLEET FORCES COMMAND WILL LEAD DELIVERY OF THE TRAINING TO ALL NAVY 
COMMANDS.  METHODS OF DELIVERY WILL BE:
    A.  PRIMARY:  FACE-TO-FACE DELIVERY.  MOBILE TRAINING TEAMS COMPOSED OF 
FLEET REPRESENTATIVES AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WILL DELIVER THE TRAINING 
FACE-TO-FACE TO COMMAND LEADERSHIP TEAMS (CO/XO/CMC) WHO, IN TURN, WILL 
EDUCATE AND TRAIN THEIR COMMANDS.  
    B.  SECONDARY:  DEFENSE CONNECT ONLINE (DCO) TRAINING.  DCO WILL BE USED 
TO REACH GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED SAILORS AND THOSE PERSONNEL ATTACHED TO NON-
NAVY COMMANDS.  THESE SESSIONS WILL BE HOSTED BY A MOBILE TRAINING TEAM WITH 
PARENT COMMAND LEADERSHIP. 
    C.  TERTIARY:  E-SOLUTION.  COMPUTER BASED TRAINING WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR 
THOSE PERSONNEL WHO CANNOT ATTEND FACE-TO-FACE OR DCO TRAINING.

5.  COMPLETION OF TRAINING (TIER 1, 2, AND 3) WILL BE DOCUMENTED VIA THE NAVY 
FAMILY ACCOUNTABILITY AND ASSESSMENT SYSTEM (NFAAS), WHICH WILL BE UPDATED TO 
DOCUMENT INDIVIDUAL TRAINING COMPLETION FOR ALL PERSONNEL.  ECHELON TWO 
COMMANDERS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE TO USFF FOR EXECUTION AND REPORTING.  SPECIFIC 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPORTING WILL BE PROVIDED VIA SEPARATE CORRESPONDENCE.

6.  THE PATH TO REPEAL OF DADT REQUIRES INFORMED AND PROACTIVE LEADERSHIP AT 
EVERY LEVEL.  I WILL ENSURE YOU REMAIN FULLY INFORMED AS WE PROGRESS.  I AM 
COUNTING ON EACH OF YOU TO ENSURE THAT THROUGHOUT THIS IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD 
WE DO WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE:  CONDUCT OURSELVES WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF 
PROFESSIONALISM AND TREAT OUR SHIPMATES WITH RESPECT.  LEADERSHIP, 
PROFESSIONALISM, DISCIPLINE, AND RESPECT ARE THE FOUNDATION OF SUCCESSFUL 
IMPLEMENTATION. 

7.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
