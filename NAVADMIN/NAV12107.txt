OS/CE REQUIREMENTS, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NO LONGER THE ONLY MEANS OF MEETING THIS

EQUIVALENT LEVEL TRAINING COURSE(S) WITH A SCORE THAT MEETS THE MINIMUM

PARTNERS.  COURSE COMPLETION CERTIFICATES MAY BE ELECTRONIC/DIGITAL IF 
DOCUMENTED BY LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS THAT HAVE A DATA EXCHANGE AGREEMENT 
WITH TWMS CSWF MODULE.

OPPORTUNITIES ONLINE TO ATTAIN OS/CE CERTIFICATIONS.
