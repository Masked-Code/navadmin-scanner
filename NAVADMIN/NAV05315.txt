SUBJ/MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  SINCE FY06 BEGAN LESS THAN THREE MONTHS AGO, 24
SAILORS AND 17 MARINES HAVE DIED ON THE NATION'S HIGHWAYS.
REGRETFULLY, THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF NAVY'S WORST MOTOR VEHICLE
SAFETY START IN 17 YEARS.  THIRTEEN OF THESE FATAL ACCIDENTS
INVOLVED SERVICEMEMBERS AND THEIR MOTORCYCLES.  THIS IS A TREND WE
CANNOT TOLERATE AND MUST CORRECT IMMEDIATELY.
2.  RESULTANT CAUSES OF THESE MISHAPS HAVE INCLUDED IMPAIRMENT DUE
TO ALCOHOL, SPEEDING, FATIGUE, FAILURE TO WEAR SEATBELTS AND EVEN
ROAD RAGE.  MOST RECENTLY, A FATAL CRASH RESULTED WHEN TWO
SERVICEMEMBERS ATTEMPTED TO RACE A TRAIN TO AN INTERSECTION.
PREDICTABLY, THE DRIVER WAS DRUNK.  THE MOST AGGREGIOUS OF THESE
ACCIDENTS HAVE OCCURRED ON WEEKEND NIGHTS.
3.  SYSTEMIC AND ROOT CAUSES OF THESE TRAGIC ACCIDENTS CAN BE TRACED
TO AN UNINFORMED SAFETY AWARENESS CULTURE THAT HAS PERPETUATED
THROUGH OUR RANKS. CLEARLY, LEADERSHIP MUST TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
TO REVERSE THIS TREND.  AS THE MAJORITY OF THESE MISHAPS ARE
OCCURRING WHILE SAILORS AND MARINES ARE ON LIBERTY, INFLUENCE OVER
THEIR CONDUCT WILL REQUIRE COMBINATIONS OF RE-EDUCATION AND TRAINING
AND INTRUSIVE LEADERSHIP.
4.  THIS IS NOT A TREND THAT WE CAN REVERSE OR AVERT BY MERELY
CONDUCTING A ONE TIME TRAINING REFRESHER OR SAFETY BRIEFING.  IT IS
IMPERATIVE THAT WE INSTILL INTO OUR SAILORS, MARINES, AND CIVILIANS
A SENSE OF OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT BOTH WHILE ON AND OFF DUTY.
IF YOUR COMMAND DOES NOT HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM FOR PMV AND
OFF-DUTY SAFETY, BUILD ONE. IF YOUR COMMAND HAS A PROGRAM,
CRITICALLY REVIEW IT AND IMPROVE IT AS NECESSARY.
5. ISICS ARE DIRECTED TO ENSURE THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMANDS HAVE
REVIEWED MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY WITHIN THEIR ORGANIZATIONS PRIOR TO
THE HOLIDAY STAND DOWN, TO INCLUDE THIS NAVADMIN, AND HAVE IN PLACE
A PROACTIVE PROGRAM THAT INSTILLS A CULTURE OF OPERATIONAL RISK
MANAGEMENT WHILE ON DUTY AND ON LIBERTY.  ADDITIONALLY, I STRONGLY
RECOMMEND THAT YOU VISIT THE NAVAL SAFETY CENTER WEBSITE
(HTTP:/SAFETYCENTER.NAVY.MIL/) AND USE THEIR TRAFFIC SAFETY TOOL
BOX AT
<HTTP:/SAFETYCENTER.NAVY.MIL/ASHORE/MOTORVEHICLE/TOOLBOX/DEFAULT.HTM>
 TO ASSIST IN THIS EFFORT. AS A MINIMUM, BEFORE GOING ON LONG PMV
TRIPS, SAILORS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO USE "ASMIS", A DRIVING RISK
ASSESSMENT PROGRAM AVAILABLE ON THE NAVAL SAFETY CENTER WEBSITE AT
<HTTP:/SAFETYCENTER.NAVY.MIL/ARTICLES/A-M/ASMIS.HTM>.  COMMANDERS
AND OICS REPORT THE RESULTS OF YOUR EFFORTS TO YOUR RESPECTIVE ISICS
