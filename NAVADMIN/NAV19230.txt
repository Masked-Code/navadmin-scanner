AMPN/REF A IS NAVADMIN 122/19, ANNOUNCEMENT OF ACTIVE DUTY ENLISTED 
ADVANCEMENT-TO-POSITION PROGRAM FOR RECRUITERS AND RECRUIT DIVISION 
COMMANDERS.//

RMKS/1.  Based upon positive Fleet feedback and the overwhelming success of 
recent pilot programs, this NAVADMIN announces permanent adoption of the 
Advancement-to-Position (A2P) program for Active Duty Sailors.  This NAVADMIN 
supersedes reference (a).  The permanent A2P program will fill priority E-6 
billets via an advancement incentive and is another step towards a modernized 
personnel system and future detailing marketplace intended to improve Fleet 
readiness and manning through better distribution of our talent.  Sailors 
selected for A2P billets will be advanced to E-6 and receive pay commensurate 
with that pay grade upon reporting to their ultimate duty station after 
successful completion of any required training enroute, unless advanced 
sooner via another advancement program.  Selected Sailors will receive 
permanent change of station orders to report to an A2P billet in line with 
current detailing business rules.  Applicants will only be considered for the 
specific A2P billets to which they have applied.

2.  Eligibility
    a.  All applicants must be E-5s who are in their detailing window for 
rotation and have taken the most recent E-6 Navy-wide advancement examination 
(NWAE) for which results have been published.  This requirement is not 
waiverable.  The program is open to Active Component Sailors only.
    b.  Applicants must be qualified to fill the specific billets to which 
they apply.  Sailors should contact their detailer if they have any questions 
regarding their ability to be detailed to an A2P billet.
    c.  All Sailors may apply to sea duty A2P billets, regardless of 
sea/shore flow considerations.  Sailors on shore duty who are due to rotate 
to sea duty will not be considered for shore duty A2P billets.

3.  Billets.  Billets identified for the A2P program will appear in the 
*Advance to Position* category in Career Management System Interactive 
Detailing (CMS-ID).  Only a limited number of billets will be offered during 
each detailing cycle and not all rates will have billets advertised each 
cycle.  To ensure billets available for this program are displayed, Sailors 
should verify the *Advance to
Position* category is selected in the optional input portion of the CMS-ID 
job search page.  Sailors should submit applications to the billets in the 
same manner as standard cycle applications.

4.  Selection.  Candidates will be selected on a competitive basis using the 
following considerations:
    a.  Final Multiple Score (FMS) from the most recently published NWAE 
cycle.  FMS is the primary criteria for selection of eligible A2P applicants.
    b.  Command comments entered into CMS-ID.  Commands with billets 
advertised for fill via the A2P program are strongly encouraged to enter 
comments into CMS-ID regarding the suitability of applicants during the 
command comment phase of the detailing cycle.
    c.  Final selection of candidates will be based upon a combination of FMS 
rank order and gaining command comments.

5.  Frocking and Advancement.  Sailors selected for A2P billets are eligible 
for frocking upon successful completion of all enroute training or schools 
required for the billet to which they were selected and will be advanced to 
the pay grade of E-6 upon check-in at their ultimate duty station.  No 
further administrative action is required by the gaining command beyond the 
normal gaining transaction.  Sailors who fail to successfully complete 
enroute training/schools required for the performance of an A2P billet will 
not be advanced to E-6, regardless of whether or not they continue to execute 
orders to the ultimate duty station.

6.  Points of Contact
    a.  MyNavy Career Center, (833) 830-MNCC/(833) 830-6622, via e- mail at 
askmncc(at)navy.mil or MyNavy Portal at https://my.navy.mil.
    b.  For billet eligibility questions, detailer contact information is 
available via MyNavy Portal by selecting the *Enlisted Detailer Contact List* 
at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/assignment-leave-travel.

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
