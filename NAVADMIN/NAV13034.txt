REF/D/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON DC/231553Z APR 12//

NARR/REF A IS SECNAVINST 1610.2A, DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY (DON) POLICY ON HAZING.  REF B IS 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE POLICY MEMORANDUM.
REF C IS OPNAVINST 3100.6J CH-2, SPECIAL INCIDENT REPORTING.
REF D IS NAVADMIN 137/12 ANNOUNCING THE MILITARY EQUAL OPPORTUNITY NETWORK (MEONET).//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE ASSIGNMENT OF THE NAVY OFFICE OF HAZING 
PREVENTION (OPNAV N137) AS THE LEAD NAVY ENTITY FOR HAZING POLICY AND FOR TRACKING 
SUBSTANTIATED CASES OF HAZING OF UNIFORMED SERVICE MEMBERS.  OPNAV N137 WILL MAINTAIN 
A DATABASE OF SUBSTANTIATED HAZING EVENTS THAT WILL BE USED TO MAINTAIN A HISTORICAL 
RECORD AND TO PERFORM TREND ANALYSIS.  OPNAV N137 WILL MAINTAIN AN ACCOUNT OF ALL 
HAZING OPREPS AND ANALYSIS RESULTS WILL BE REPORTED TO THE CHIEF OF NAVAL PERSONNEL ON A 
QUARTERLY BASIS.

2.  PER REFS A AND B, HAZING IS DEFINED AS ANY CONDUCT WHEREBY A MILITARY MEMBER OR 
MEMBERS, REGARDLESS OF SERVICE OR RANK, WITHOUT PROPER AUTHORITY CAUSES ANOTHER 
MILITARY MEMBER OR MEMBERS, REGARDLESS OF SERVICE OR RANK, TO SUFFER OR BE EXPOSED TO 
ANY ACTIVITY WHICH IS CRUEL, ABUSIVE, HUMILIATING, OPPRESSIVE, DEMEANING, OR HARMFUL.  
SOLICITING OR COERCING ANOTHER TO PERPETRATE ANY SUCH ACTIVITY IS ALSO CONSIDERED HAZING.  
HAZING NEED NOT INVOLVE PHYSICAL CONTACT AMONG OR BETWEEN MILITARY MEMBERS; IT CAN BE 
VERBAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL IN NATURE.  ACTUAL OR IMPLIED CONSENT TO ACTS OF HAZING DOES NOT 
ELIMINATE THE CULPABILITY OF THE PERPETRATOR.

3.  HAZING IS CONTRARY TO OUR CORE VALUES OF HONOR, COURAGE, AND COMMITMENT.  THESE 
CORE VALUES ARE OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR  TREATING EVERY SAILOR WITH DIGNITY AND 
RESPECT, AND AS A VALUED MEMBER OF THE NAVY TEAM.  HAZING DEGRADES AND DIMINISHES THE 
ABILITY OF VICTIMS TO FUNCTION WITHIN THEIR UNIT, IT DESTROYS OUR SAILORS CONFIDENCE AND 
TRUST IN THEIR SHIPMATES AND IS DESTRUCTIVE TO UNIT COHESION AND  COMBAT READINESS.  
BOTTOM LINE, HAZING IS NOT A PART OF OUR TIME-HONORED TRADITIONS AND IT HAS NO PLACE IN 
THE MODERN NAVY.

4.  HAZING MAY BE INDICATIVE OF LARGER COMMAND CLIMATE CONCERNS.
THEREFORE, HAZING SHALL BE TRACKED AT THE COMMAND LEVEL BY ASSIGNED COMMAND MANAGED 
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY (CMEO) PROGRAM MANAGERS, EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ADVISORS (EOA) AND 
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY (EO) PROGRAM  MANAGERS.
CMEO PROGRAM MANAGERS SHALL ADVISE THE COMMANDING OFFICER TO ENSURE TIMELY 
REPORTING OF EVENTS.  CMEOS DO NOT RECEIVE ADDITIONAL TRAINING ON HAZING, BUT OPNAV 
N137 IS AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS ON POLICY AND CLARIFICATION OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  
EOAS AND EO PROGRAM  MANAGERS SHALL ASSIST SUBORDINATE OR LOCAL CMEOS IN THE 
COMPLETION OF  REPORTING AND MENTOR CMEOS IN ADVISING COMMANDING OFFICERS.

5.  THE TRACKING OF SUBSTANTIATED HAZING REPORTS IS VITAL TO  DETERMINING THE EXTENT TO 
WHICH HAZING INCIDENTS INVOLVING OUR SAILORS ARE  OCCURRING AND THE NATURE OF SUCH 
HAZING INCIDENTS.  COMMANDS SHALL CONTINUE TO REPORT ANY SUBSTANTIATED HAZING EVENT 
IAW REF C, AND SHALL INCLUDE HAZING INCIDENTS IN THEIR QUARTERLY CRIMINAL ACTIVITY REPORTS.

6.  HAZING INCIDENT REPORTING, PER REF C.
    A.  THE COMMAND OF THE IDENTIFIED COMPLAINANT OF A HAZING EVENT  SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR FILING THE OPREP.
    B.  OPREPS CONCERNING HAZING SHALL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING PLAS:
        CNO WASHINGTON DC//N00E/N137//
        CHNAVPERS WASHINGTON DC//JJJ//
        COMNAVPERSCOM MILLINGTON TN//JJJ//
        NAVY JAG WASHINGTON DC//JJJ//
    C.  INITIAL OPREPS SHALL IN LINE 17 (SUMMARY/BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT) INDICATE THE 
APPROPRIATE HAZING CATEGORY(IES):
        (1)  PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE
        (2)  VERBALLY ABUSIVE
        (3)  DEMEANING OR PSYCHOLOGICALLY HUMILIATING
        (4)  A COMBINATION OF CATEGORIES - REPORTING TO INCLUDE WHICH CATEGORIES, IF MULTIPLE
    D.  THESE REVISIONS WILL BE INCORPORATED IN THE NEXT UPDATE TO REF C.

7.  COMMANDS SHALL COMPLY WITH THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS IN REF A.  TRAINING IS AVAILABLE 
AT THE NAVY KNOWLEDGE ONLINE COMMANDING OFFICERS TRAINING LIBRARY.

8.  OPNAV N137 WILL MODIFY THE MEONET DATABASE ANNOUNCED IN REF D TO INCLUDE TRACKING 
INFORMATION OF HAZING INCIDENTS.
THE MODIFIED MEONET DATABASE WILL IMPROVE THE METHOD OF REPORTING HAZING INCIDENTS IN 
AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF HAZING AND THE NATURE OF EVENTS AND WILL DISPLAY 
ALL REPORTED HAZING, DISCRIMINATION, AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT (EITHER INFORMAL OR FORMAL, 
SUBSTANTIATED OR UNSUBSTANTIATED), FOR THE HISTORY OF A GIVEN COMMAND IN ORDER TO 
FACILITATE TREND ANALYSIS.  EOAS, EO PROGRAM MANAGERS, AND CMEO PROGRAM MANAGERS 
WILL BE NOTIFIED BY OPNAV N137 ONCE THE MEONET MODIFICATION IS COMPLETE.  EOAS, EO 
PROGRAM MANAGERS, AND CMEO PROGRAM MANAGERS SHALL THEN USE MEONET TO TRACK ALL 
HAZING EVENTS IN ADDITION TO THE SUBMISSION OF OPREPS BY THE CHAIN OF COMMAND FOR 
SUBSTANTIATED HAZING EVENTS.

9.  THESE PROCEDURES AND POLICIES ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT 
UNLESS SUPERSEDED BY REVISIONS TO REF A, REF C, OR NAVY EO POLICY.
