SUBJ/FY-17 FULL TIME SUPPORT AVIATION COMMAND RETENTION BONUS//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the continuation of the Full Time Support 
(FTS) Aviation Command Retention Bonus (ACRB).  The FTS ACRB is designed to 
retain for continued naval service those officers with the talent and command 
experience in our primary warfighting missions that is critical for the 
future of our institution.

2.  FTS ACRB applicants must be currently serving as a commanding officer 
(CO) of an eligible operational (OP), operational training (OP-T), or special 
mission (SM) O-5 command in order to apply. Eligible commands are those OP, 
OP-T and SM O-5 commands for which the annual Aviation Command Screen Board 
selects and slates officers to serve as COs, excluding second-in-
grade/sequential/bonus commands.  Eligibility to apply for the FTS ACRB ends 
on the last day of command.

3.  Post command commanders not on contract, who served as CO of an eligible 
OP, OP-T or SM O-5 command between 1 October 2016 and the release date of 
this NAVADMIN are eligible to apply within 30 days from release of this 
NAVADMIN whereby signed contracts must be received by Augmentation Management 
Division (PERS-46).

4.  All FTS ACRB contracts will be for 36,000 dollars.  All eligible officers 
will receive 18,000 dollars per year for 2 years of obligated service, which 
is the 21st and 22nd year of commissioned service.  If an FTS ACRB contract 
of an officer is approved after completing 20 years of commissioned service, 
then the FTS ACRB obligation period begins on the date of contract approval 
and ends 2 years later.
