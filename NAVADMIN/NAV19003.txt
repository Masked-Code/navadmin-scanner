RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN outlines the Navy’s implementation process and 
timelines for transitioning to a new Cybersecurity Workforce (CSWF) framework 
(references a through f germane) as outlined in reference (g).  The 
Department of the Navy obtained a Department of Defense(DoD) Office of the 
Chief Information Officer waiver from the DoDM 8570.01 requirements for 
military and civilians, reference (h), allowing implementation of the Cyber 
Information Technology /Cybersecurity Workforce (Cyber IT/CSWF) management 
and qualification program detailed in references (f) and (g).  The Navy will 
transition from reference (e) to reference (f) in three phases over an 18-
month time period.  The contractor workforce remains governed by DoDM 8570.01 
(reference (e)).

2.  The Navy will employ a three-phased transition approach.  Phase I 
includes actions necessary to establish the transition foundation.  Many of 
these actions are ongoing.  Phase I will be completed by Fiscal Year (FY) 
2019, fourth quarter.  Phase II begins in the fourth quarter FY 2019 and will 
conclude fourth quarter FY 2020.  Phase III includes sustainment and 
continuous improvement actions that will continue for the program lifecycle.  
The phasing plan does not preclude commands from moving to sustainment 
faster.

3.  This transition will generate lessons-learned and implementation actions 
that differ from references (f) and (g).  Interim execution guidance will be 
issued by Director, Navy Cybersecurity Division (OPNAV N2N6G) and formalized 
via revisions of references (f) and (g).  Copies of program execution 
documents and templates assisting commands in setting up and maintaining 
their Cyber IT/CSWF qualification programs will be available in the reference 
section of the U.S. Naval Information Forces (NAVIFOR) CSWF home page at:
https://usff.navy.deps.mil/sites/navifor/manpower/cswf/sitepages
/home.aspx.  A common access card, using the e-mail credential, is required 
to access this site.

4.  Phase I.  Cyber Workforce (OPNAV N2N6G1) will lead Phase I actions in 
consultation with NAVIFOR (Office of Primary Responsibility), Echelon II and 
III CSWF Program Managers, Office of Chief Human Resources (OCHR), and Deputy 
Chief of Naval Operations for Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education.  
Key actions include but may not be limited to the following:
    a.  OPNAV N2N6G1 develops and implements a formal process communicating 
implementation details, status, and required changes, including a regularly 
scheduled in progress reviews on transition progress.
    b.  Outline procedures for assessing employee proficiency levels.
    c.  Establish an OPNAV N2N6G1 and OCHR transition working group 
addressing Human Resource issues including union notifications for both the 
National Capital Region and local bargaining units.
    d.  Update and publish an integrated CSWF Management Oversight Compliance 
Committee/Training, Education, and Certification Advisory Team charter.
    e.  Evaluate and validate qualification requirements including 
foundational, residential, and continuing education.  This includes 
clarifying experience and using personnel qualification standards for 
civilian employees.
    f.  Monitor Manpower offices completion and reconciliation of military 
billet coding in the Total Force Manpower Management System (TFMMS).
    g.  Monitor OCHR completion of civilian billet coding in the Defense 
Civilian Personnel Data System and reconcile in TFMMS.
    h.  Staff updates and draft SECNAV and OPNAV Cyber IT/CSWF policy as 
needed to support workforce management.
    i. Identify funding, validate functionality and review business rules for 
the Total Workforce Management System (TWMS) CSWF module.
    j.  Reference (i) remains in effect throughout the transition period and 
will be reevaluated during program sustainment.

5.  Phase II.  This phase is required for all Navy commands with Cyber 
IT/CSWF personnel.  Key actions include but may not be limited to the 
following:
    a.  Ensure Cyber IT/CSWF cyber work role codes in Total Workforce 
Management System (TWMS) are the same as the Cyber work roles code in TFMMS.
    b.  Update civilian Cyber IT/CSWF position descriptions including the 
work role assignment and the condition of employment statement found in 
reference (g) Chapter 3 b (g) 1.  Use templates found at NAVIFOR web page for 
minimum mandatory language.
    c. Commands notify employees, in writing, that they are in the Cyber 
IT/CSWF.  Assign them a work role and provide employees with a list of 
foundational and residential qualification requirements found in appendix 4 
of reference (g).
    d.  Enter and validate personnel qualifications in TWMS.  Determine 
individual qualification status and implement process to qualify personnel 
not later than one year after the employee is notified by human resources 
that they are a member of the Cyber IT/CSWF.
Maintain and revise qualification information as required in TWMS.
    e.  Update individual development plans for personnel that do not meet 
the qualification requirements with a qualification plan and date.  Employees 
failing to meet qualification standards are subject to local policies and 
administrative procedures.
    f.  NAVIFOR analyzes TWMS data, identify gaps, and significant trends.  
Formulate corrective courses of action and recommendations.

6.  Phase III.  Execute SECNAV M-5239.2 and related OPNAV issuances.
    a.  Ensure all new Cyber IT/CSWF billets are properly coded in TFMMS and 
TWMS.  Ensure changes to billet coding are made as necessary.
    b.  Ensure TWMS data is updated and maintained accurately depicting 
qualification status of all personnel assigned to Cyber IT /CSWF billets.
    c.  Ensure Cyber IT/CSWF personnel meet continuous learning requirements.
    d.  When new systems or software is deployed ensure personnel assigned to 
Cyber IT and CSWF billets complete new or revised training and on the job 
qualification, as necessary.
    e.  Ensure personnel newly assigned to Cyber IT/CSWF billets complete 
qualification in accordance with the Secretary of the Navy and Office of the 
Chief of Naval Operations policy.

7.  Released by VADM Matthew J. Kohler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
