RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces three significant changes to the leader 
development paths outlined in the Navy Leader Development Framework 
(NLDF).  These requirements will be incorporated into future revisions of 
references (a) and (b).  Reference (a) outlines how our Navy will develop 
leaders who demonstrate operational excellence, strong character and 
resilience at every level of seniority. 
 
2.  Enlisted Leader Development (ELD).  Reference (b) states that the various 
levels of ELD replaced similar levels of the now-defunct Petty Officer 
Selectee Leadership Courses.  ELD courses are to be completed while in 
current paygrade (i.e., all E-5 Sailors must complete the Intermediate Leader 
Development Course (ILDC) while serving as an E-5 and prior to eligibility 
for advancement to E-6). The Foundational Leader Development Course (FLDC) is 
for Sailors in paygrades E-3 and E-4.  The ILDC is for Sailors in paygrade  
E-5. The Advanced Leader Development Course (ALDC) is for Sailors in paygrade 
E-6.  ILDC and ALDC will be a prerequisite for advancement to E-6 and E-7 
respectively, starting in calendar year 2025.  FLDC will still be available 
but will not be a requirement for eligibility for advancement. 
    a.  Naval Leadership and Ethics Command (NLEC) San Diego and NLEC Dam 
Neck are responsible for training all Command-Navy Leader Development 
Facilitators (C-NLDF) in the Fleet.  Only Chief Petty Officers (CPO), Senior 
Chief Petty Officers (SCPO), or Master Chief Petty Officers (MCPO) who have 
attended and passed the C-NLDF course may facilitate FLDC, ILDC, and ALDC 
classes.  Previously qualified Master Mobile Team Trainers must maintain 
their qualification through NLEC San Diego and NLEC Dam Neck in order to 
qualify new C-NLDF facilitators.  A minimum of two qualified facilitators are 
required to conduct any of these courses at a local command. Command Master 
Chiefs (CMDCM) are responsible for managing the number of qualified C-NLDFs 
and tracking the number Sailors who have completed ELD courses at their 
commands in the Fleet Training Management and Planning System (FLTMPS). 
    b.  The FLDC, ILDC and ALDC classes can be completed either virtually by 
NLEC staff or in-person by NLEC staff or trained C-NLDFs.  The C-NLDF course 
and the Chief Petty Officer Leader Development Course (CPO-LDC) will only be 
offered as in-person learning.  Only certified C-NLDFs at the SCPO or MCPO 
level who are CPO-LDC qualified may facilitate CPO-LDC.  NLEC San Diego and 
NLEC Dam Neck currently offer CPO-LDC and will be responsible for the 
certification of CPO-LDC facilitators.  CPO-LDC will be a prerequisite for 
advancement to E-8 commencing with the Fiscal Year 2026 Selection 
Board.  Units will also enter and verify documentation of completion in 
FLTMPS for CPOs attending CPO-LDC. 
    c.  Leader development for MCPOs that are not on a community-specific 
command track will be completed in conjunction with the Senior Leader Course 
(SLC) identified in paragraph 4 below. 
 
3.  Intermediate Leadership Course (ILC).  This course offers one week of 
high-impact, professional learning experiences intended to facilitate and 
foster the growth of motivated and engaged leaders who are dedicated to 
building effective teams and implementing a command vision.  This is 
accomplished through an emphasis on self-awareness, decision science, ethical 
decision making, bias awareness and in-class engagements concentrated on 
developing and enhancing the skills required to inspire, connect and 
strengthen the performance of our Navy team. 
    a.  The ILC is required for all intermediate-level officers with 
7 to 12 years of commissioned service and serves as the formal linkage 
between the Division Officer Leadership Course and applicable leadership 
courses for more senior officers.  While the course may be completed in 
conjunction with other required community-specific training, such as an 
established department head (DH) pipeline in line with exhibit 1 of reference 
(c), assignment to DH positions or positions of similar responsibility are 
not a consideration for attendance. 
    b.  The ILC is offered at NLEC Newport, NLEC San Diego and NLEC Dam 
Neck.  Unit commanders, commanding officers and officers-in-charge will 
ensure officers meeting the requirements outlined in reference (c), as 
clarified in paragraph 3a, have the opportunity to attend ILC.  Units will 
also enter and verify documentation of completion in FLTMPS for each officer 
attending ILC. 
 
4.  Senior Leader Course (SLC).  This course offers one week of high-impact, 
professional learning experiences intended to facilitate the empowerment of 
adaptive and inspirational leaders to recognize and embrace their ability to 
influence and shape organizations.  This is accomplished through a focus on 
self-awareness, decision science, shaping organizational behavior, ethical 
decision making, bias awareness and resilience. 
   a.  The SLC is required for all Active-Duty officers who have been 
selected for or newly promoted to Commander (O-5) and are not on a community-
specific command track in line with reference (c). Additionally, this course 
is recommended for Active-Duty MCPOs.  Due to class size limitations, 
officers and MCPOs who have been selected for a training path requiring their 
attendance at the command master chief/command senior enlisted leader/chief 
of the boat, prospective executive officer, and/or prospective commanding 
officer leadership courses will not attend SLC.  However, attendance at SLC 
does not prohibit future opportunities for selection to a command track. 
    b.  The SLC is offered at NLEC Newport, NLEC San Diego and NLEC Dam 
Neck.  Unit commanders, commanding officers and officers-in- charge will 
ensure officers and MCPOs meeting the requirements outlined in reference (c), 
as clarified in paragraph 4a, have the opportunity to attend SLC.  Units will 
also enter and verify documentation of completion in FLTMPS for each officer 
or MCPO attending SLC.
