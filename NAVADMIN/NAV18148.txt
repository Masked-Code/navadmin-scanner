RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the solicitation of applications from highly 
qualified and motivated E6 through E9 Sailors for the FY-20 Navy Selected 
Reserve limited duty officer (LDO) and chief warrant officer (CWO) programs.  
Where conflicts with reference (a) exist, this NAVADMIN takes precedence.

2.  The Selected Reserve LDO/CWO Board will consider candidates for the 
following officer designators:  623X, 626X, 628X, 629X, 633X, 641X, 649X, 
653X, 711X, 712X, 713X, 715X, 716X, 717X, 781X, 782X, and 783X.  Eligible 
Sailors are encouraged to apply for the designators for which they are most 
qualified, regardless of current rating.  Refer to references (a) and (b) for 
eligibility criteria and application format.  For up to date information 
concerning open designators, visit the community manager page at
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/communitymanagers/reserve/selres/pages/RCLDOCWO.aspx.

3.  LDOs and CWOs bring a variety of experience and unique perspectives into 
the wardroom from their enlisted service.  LDO/CWO career paths provide 
additional leadership opportunities and enhance the ability of a Sailor to 
contribute to the Navy Reserve.  These programs deliver to the officer corps 
seasoned professionals with proven leadership abilities at an economical 
cost.  LDOs provide broad technical management and leadership skills, and 
CWOs provide specific technical expertise and leadership skills in support of 
the unrestricted line, restricted line, and staff corps communities.
LDOs and CWOs serve in a variety of leadership billets within their technical 
fields, ranging from division officers to commanding officers (CO).

4.  Updated policy guidance to reference (a).
    a.  Time in service (TIS) for the FY-20 board must be computed to 1 
October 2019.  In line with references (a) and (b), TIS is synonymous with 
years of qualifying service toward a non-regular (reserve) retirement.
    b.  TIS eligibility is 8 to 14 years for LDO and 14 to 20 years for CWO.  
However, TIS waivers will be considered and adjudicated on a case-by-case 
basis by the Head Reserve Officer Community Manager (OCM) (BUPERS-351).  
Potential applicants, outside of the TIS eligibility window, are encouraged 
to contact the Reserve LDO/CWO OCM in paragraph 14 of this NAVADMIN, to 
discuss TIS waiver opportunities.
    c.  In line with reference (b), all applicants must include a statement 
on page 7 of Officer Package Application (OPNAV 1420/1 Rev 01-08), agreeing 
to further service, as follows:  *I, [name], if selected for permanent 
appointment under the Navy Reserve LDO/CWO program, agree to accept such 
appointment and further agree to remain in the Ready Reserve for a period of 
3 years after I accept such appointment.*
    d.  CO/officer-in-charge (OIC) endorsement, located on page 10 of OPNAV 
1420/1 (Rev 01-08), must contain the following statement:
*Applicant meets all requirements outlined in OPNAVINST 1420.1B, NAVADMIN 
281/12, NAVADMIN XXX/18 (use the NAVADMIN # for this message), and the 
physical fitness standards of OPNAVINST 6110.1J.*

5.  First class petty officers serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Horn of 
Africa determined to be chief petty officer board eligible in line with 
reference (c) or reference (d) are also eligible for LDO if all other 
eligibility requirements are met.

6.  Interview appraisal boards shall be constructed and approved by the 
CO/OIC and consist of a minimum of three naval officers (LDO/CWO, if 
available).  Every effort shall be made (including but not limited to 
teleconference, video teleconference, defense connect online, etc.) to ensure 
at least one board member is from the designator for which the applicant is 
applying.  All applicants applying to the 715X or 717X designators must have 
the CO of Sea, Air, and Land Team 17 or 18 as an interview appraisal board 
member if the applicant is assigned outside of the Naval Special Warfare 
claimancy.  Minimum grade requirements for board members are lieutenant 
junior grade or CWO2 with 2 years time-in-grade.  Three interview appraisals 
must be submitted for each applicant.  The potential block on interview 
appraisals must be marked for LDO/CWO candidates.  Only the current version 
of the Interviewers Appraisal Sheet, located at 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/administrative/ldo_cwo/Pages/default.aspx, will be accepted.

7.  For applicants who have or are currently serving in Individual 
Augmentee/Global Support Assignments (IA/GSA), include these tours in the 
assignment history section of the application.  CO/OIC recommendation must 
include validation of any listed IA/GSA assignment and the statement in 
reference (c), paragraph 3.

8.  Applicants currently serving on IA/GSA may have their application 
endorsed by their field commander.  All applications endorsed by field 
commanders must have the parent command concurrence of the member.  A sample 
format is located at http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/administrative/ldo_cwo/pages/default.aspx (See Sample Addendum 
Letter).

9.  Applicants must ensure copies of the most recent periodic evaluation are 
included in the application or later addendum for board review and 
continuity.  First class petty officers must submit the 15 November 2018 
evaluation via addendum.

10.  Applicants must maintain eligibility throughout the selection and 
commissioning process.  Applicants deemed ineligible after the submission of 
applications must be declared ineligible by their current CO, field commander 
or parent command CO if on an IA.  A sample letter of abeyance or removal of 
recommendation memo is located at http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/administrative/ldo_cwo/pages/default.aspx.

11.  Each applicant and command must ensure applications are complete and 
accurate.  Incomplete applications could result in non- selection.  Refer to 
reference (a), (chapters 2, 7, and appendix b, c, and f) for security 
clearance information, program overview, eligibility criteria, and 
application format.
