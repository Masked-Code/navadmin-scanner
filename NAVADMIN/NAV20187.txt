reflected in paragraph 2 below align with the Presidents Budget for 2021.  
This plan will be adjusted if necessary based on subsequent execution year 
decisions made by leadership or as required by Congressional action.

(INAC), the projected schedule for inactivating U.S. battle force and non 
battle force naval vessels in FY21 is promulgated as follows:

3.  Per reference (b), Fleet Commanders shall submit an Organizational Change 
Request for commissioned U.S. ships and per reference (a) to formally notify 
the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) of a ships 
decommissioning, INAC, or end of service.  Submit revisions due to 
operational schedule changes per references (a) and (b).  It is the 
responsibility of Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command and Commander, U.S. 
Pacific Fleet in coordination with their respective TYCOM to ensure the 
appropriate lower echelon commands are notified of any changes in the ship 
inactivation schedules, as well as Integrated Warfare (OPNAV N9I) and OPNAV 
resource sponsor.

4.  Adjustments to paragraph 2 ship inactivations that cross the current 
fiscal year must be coordinated with OPNAV N9I due to Congressional 
requirements for execution year force structure changes that differ from what 
Congress authorized/appropriated and signed into law by the President.  OPNAV 
shall promulgate changes to the inactivation fiscal year as required.

5.  The ships commanding officer, masters, or Immediate Superior In Command, 
shall submit a final naval message (normally transmitted in conjunction with 
the decommissioning ceremony) announcing the ships official retirement date 
and include a brief history of the significant events in the life of the ship 
per reference (a).  The Naval History and Heritage Command (NAVHISTHERITAGE 
WASHINGTON DC) and Naval Vessel Register Custodian (NVR NORFOLK VA), shall be 
included as INFO addees.
