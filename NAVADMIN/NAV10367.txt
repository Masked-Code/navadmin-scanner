NARR/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1430.6F, ADVANCEMENT MANUAL FOR THE ENLISTED 
PERSONNEL OF U.S. NAVY AND U.S. NAVY RESERVE.  REF B IS PAY AND 
PERSONNEL INFORMATION BULLETIN 09-12.

SUBJ/TIME-IN-RATE (TIR) CALCULATION//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN CLARIFIES THE PROPER PROCEDURE FOR CALCULATING 
TIR.
THE PROCEDURE FOR CALCULATING TIR CONTAINED IN THIS MESSAGE IS 
SUPPLEMENTAL TO INFORMATION FOUND IN REF A AND SUPERSEDES THE PROCEDURE 
OUTLINED IN REF B.  THIS TIR CALCULATION PROCEDURE IS EFFECTIVE 
IMMEDIATELY.

2.  TIR DATE IS THE DATE FROM WHICH AN ADVANCEMENT CANDIDATE'S TOTAL 
SERVICE IN PAY GRADE IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE COMMENCED FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
COMPUTING ADVANCEMENT ELIGIBILITY FOR THE NEXT HIGHER PAY GRADE.  TIR 
DATES ARE ASSIGNED AS SHOWN IN REF A, TABLE 2-8.

3.  CALCULATE TIR BY COMPARING TIR DATE FOR CURRENT PAY GRADE TO CURRENT 
DATE (OR TO AN "AS OF" DATE).  EXAMPLE:  A SAILOR REACHES NINE MONTHS 
TIR AS AN E2 ON 1 MAY 2010.  PER REF A, PARA 704, THE SAILOR IS ADVANCED 
TO E3 ON
16 MAY
2010.  PER REF A, TABLE 2-8, THE SAILOR'S E3 TIR DATE IS ESTABLISHED AS 
1 MAY 2010.  AS OF 1 NOV 2010, THE SAILOR WILL HAVE SIX MONTHS TIR AS AN 
E3 AND HAS MET THE TIR ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENT FOR ADVANCEMENT TO E4.

4.  IF A SAILOR IS IN A PROGRAM THAT AUTHORIZES AUTOMATIC ADVANCEMENT TO 
E4 UPON REACHING REQUIRED TIR AS AN E3, THEN THE RESULTING NEW E4 TIR 
DATE IS NOT RELEVANT WHEN DETERMINING ORIGINAL TIR ELIGIBILITY FOR THE 
SAILOR TO ADVANCE TO E4.  EXAMPLE:  A SAILOR IN SUCH A PROGRAM REACHES 
SIX MONTHS TIR AS AN E3 ON 1 NOV 2010.  ASSUMING ALL OTHER ELIGIBILITY 
REQUIREMENTS ARE MET, ADVANCEMENT TO E4 IS EFFECTIVE 16 NOV 2010, WITH 
THE SAILOR'S NEW E4 TIR DATE ESTABLISHED AS 1 JUL 2010.  THIS NEW E4 TIR 
DATE DETERMINES WHEN THE SAILOR WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR E5, BUT HAS NO 
BEARING ON TIR ELIGIBILITY TO BE AUTOMATICALLY ADVANCED TO E4.

5.  PER REF A, PARA 1103.C, ELIGIBLE SAILORS MAY BE ADVANCED VIA COMMAND 
ADVANCEMENT PROGRAM (CAP) IF TIR REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN MET.  EXAMPLE:  
A SAILOR AT A COMMAND WITH CAP AUTHORITY REACHES SIX MONTHS TIR AS AN
E3 ON 1
MAR 2011.  IF ALL OTHER CAP ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ARE MET, THE 
COMMANDING OFFICER MAY CAP ADVANCE THE SAILOR TO E4 ON 1 MAR 2011.  THE 
SAILOR'S NEW E4 TIR DATE IS ESTABLISHED AS 1 JAN 2011.  THIS NEW E4 TIR 
DATE DETERMINES WHEN A SAILOR WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR E5, BUT HAS NO 
BEARING ON TIR ELIGIBILITY TO BE CAP ADVANCED TO E4.

6.  TERMINAL ELIGIBILITY DATE (TED) REQUIREMENTS SHOWN IN REF A, TABLE 
2-5, ARE USED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR PARTICIPATION IN ADVANCEMENT 
EXAMINATION CYCLES ONLY.  THEY ARE NOT TO BE USED TO ESTABLISH 
ELIGIBILITY FOR NON-EXAMINED ADVANCEMENTS.
