RMKS/1.  Sailor 2025, a living breathing set of approximately 45 initiatives, 
demonstrates the commitment of the Navy to recruiting and retaining the force 
of tomorrow.  While our goal is to retain and reward the best and brightest 
of the Navy, not every high performing Sailor chooses to stay Navy.  This 
NAVADMIN announces the development of one of the Sailor 2025 initiatives 
titled Targeted Reentry Program (TRP) which is designed to streamline the 
process to bring back highly talented Sailors.

2.  TRP overview.  TRP empowers commanding officers (CO) to identify Active 
Component (AC) and Full Time Support (FTS) officer and enlisted personnel who 
have elected to leave active-duty (AD) service and do not desire to affiliate 
with the Ready Reserve and recommend them to be awarded a Golden Ticket or 
Silver Ticket. TRP is designed to benefit both the Sailor and the Navy by 
allowing continued service of well-trained leaders who possess valuable and 
needed skills.  Golden Ticket recipients are guaranteed return to AD (AC/FTS) 
within 1 year of release, as long as they remain fully qualified in line with 
references (a) through (e).  Silver Ticket recipients are provided the 
opportunity to return to AD within 2 years of release, subject to the needs 
of the Navy, provided they remain fully qualified in line with references (a) 
through (e). Golden Tickets not used within the first year become Silver 
Tickets for the second year.  If not used within 2 years of release from AD, 
Silver Tickets expire.

3.  Status and Participation Criteria while in TRP.  Members who are selected 
and accept a TRP ticket will be transferred to a minimum Reserve status known 
as Standby Reserve-Inactive (USNR-S2) for up to 2 years upon release from AD.  
In USNR-S2 status, members are subject to minimal participation requirements 
in the Navy Reserve thereby enhancing the ability of the member to engage in 
desired civilian pursuits.  USNR-S2 members will not train with the Reserves 
for pay or retirement points, compete for promotion/advancement nor accrue 
qualifying years towards non-regular retirement eligibility. USNR-S2 members 
are not entitled to Tricare Reserve Select or Service members Group Life 
Insurance.

4.  TRP Eligibility:
    a.  Officers:  AD officers in paygrades O-3 and O-4 who have completed 
their Minimum Service Requirement, but have not yet reached 14 years of 
active service are eligible for TRP consideration.  Officers must have 
attained community qualifications, demonstrated sustained superior 
performance in their Fitness Reports, and passed their most recent Physical 
Fitness Assessment (PFA).  Officers who have failed to select for promotion 
are not eligible.  Additionally, prospective participants must meet character 
standards (i.e., no record of civil arrest/non-judicial punishment, courts-
martial, failed drug screening, etc.).  Officers who do not meet and maintain 
retention standards in line with references (a) through (e) will not be 
eligible to return to AD under the TRP.
    b.  Enlisted:  AD enlisted personnel in paygrades E-4 to E-6 who have 
completed their Expiration of Active Obligated Service (EAOS), but have not 
reached 14 years of active service are eligible for consideration in TRP.  
Sailors must have attained community qualifications, demonstrated sustained 
superior performance in their Evaluation Reports, and passed their most 
recent PFA.  Additionally, prospective participants must meet character 
standards (i.e., no record of civil arrest/NJP, courts-martial, failed drug 
screening, etc.).  Sailors who do not meet and maintain retention standards 
in line with references (a) through (e) will not be eligible to return to AD 
under the TRP.

5.  TRP Ticket Request and Issuance Process:
    a.  Officers:  When an officer submits a voluntary resignation request in 
line with reference (g), COs may recommend high performing officers who meet 
TRP criteria for a Golden or Silver Ticket in their endorsement of the 
resignation request, and forward it to the Officer Community Management 
Division (BUPERS-3) via the Officer Community Manager.  Golden Tickets will 
be issued during each fiscal year based on community health and target 
retention goals.  There is no limit to the number of Silver Tickets that may 
be awarded.  BUPERS-3 will adjudicate each request based on the program 
criteria, endorsement of the CO, and needs of the Navy. Once a determination 
is made, BUPERS-3 will send a notification letter to inform the command of 
the disposition of the request, and COs will notify their officers.
    b.  Enlisted:  Upon notification of the intent of the Sailor to separate, 
COs will recommend high performing enlisted personnel who meet the TRP 
criteria, via the command career counselor in Career Waypoints (C-WAY) for 
consideration.  BUPERS-3 will approve Golden Tickets via C-WAY each fiscal 
year, based on community health and target retention goals.  There is no 
limit to the number of Silver Tickets that may be awarded.  Once a 
determination is made, BUPERS-3 will notify the command via C-WAY.  COs will 
notify their enlisted personnel.
    c.  BUPERS-3 is the approving authority for all TRP ticket requests (both 
Golden and Silver Tickets) and will make determinations based on the overall 
performance of the member, community health, and needs of the Navy.
    d.  Once approved for a Golden or Silver Ticket, officers and enlisted 
personnel will have the option to accept or reject participation in the TRP 
prior to their release from AD.
    e.  Commander, Navy Personnel Command will transition TRP participants 
from AD to the USNR-S2 for a period not to exceed 2 years from release from 
AD, with minimal participation requirements in the Reserves, and a 
streamlined return to AD.
    f.  Date of Rank (DOR) of officers and Time in Rate (TIR) of enlisted 
personnel participating in TRP will be adjusted upon return of participant to 
AD.  DOR adjustment for officers will be made in line with references (h) and 
(i), and TIR adjustments for enlisted personnel will be made in the manner of 
Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) adjustments as delineated in reference (j).  
Sailors who return to active duty using TRP will maintain the last rating and 
paygrade held at the time of separation.

6.  For officer and enlisted personnel who have resignations or C-WAY 
requests submitted at the time of release of this NAVADMIN, the following 
guidance applies:
    a.  Officers:  Officers who have pending resignation requests dated on or 
after 1 October 2017, but have not yet been adjudicated are eligible for TRP 
consideration.  Requests must be made by the CO through positive endorsement 
and sent to BUPERS-3 for review and adjudication.
    b.  Enlisted:  Enlisted personnel who are in Intends to Separate (ITS) 
status in all C-WAY looks on/after 1 April 2018 and have a soft 
EAOS/Extensions of January 2019 and later are eligible for TRP consideration.  
Requests must be made by the CO through positive endorsement via C-WAY for 
review and adjudication.

7.  Return to AD Process.  Valid TRP participants will initiate return to AD 
by contacting the Reserve Personnel Management Division (PERS-9).

8.  In order to meet the requirements of reference (k), nuclear trained 
personnel requests for TRP tickets shall be routed through Nuclear Program 
Manager (OPNAV N133) prior to adjudication by BUPERS-3.  Requests by nuclear 
trained personnel to redeem a TRP ticket and return to AD must be validated 
by OPNAV N133 prior to action by PERS-9.
