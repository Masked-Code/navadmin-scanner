SUBJ/MIT SEMINAR XXI CLASS OF ACADEMIC YEAR 2023-2024 CALL FOR APPLICATIONS// 
 
RMKS/1.  This is the call for applications for the Academic Year 2023-2024 
(AY23-24) Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Seminar XXI - Foreign 
Policy, International Relations, and the National Interest.  Seminar XXI 
represents a unique opportunity for future policy leaders to share 
perspectives while cultivating their understanding of the intricate 
relationships among economy, society, and culture in the international 
environment.  Seminar XXI Fellows develop broad perspectives and analytical 
skills that enable them to evaluate and formulate national policy. 
 
2.  Seminar XXI is an educational program for current and future leaders in 
the U.S. national security and foreign policy communities.  Administered by 
MIT's Center for International Studies, the program is intended for 
professionals with significant potential to move into key decision-making 
roles in the next 5-10 years.  Program participants, known as Fellows, come 
from a wide range of sponsoring organizations including the armed forces, 
Federal agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private companies.  The 
goal of Seminar XXI is to equip rising military officials and civilian 
executives with the multi-dimensional analytic skills needed to understand 
foreign relations and shape effective policy options for the United States. 
 
3.  Course Schedule.  Participants will meet for a total of nine sessions 
during the 2023-24 academic year, beginning in September 2023 and ending in 
May 2024. Sessions will include one (1) introductory session; three (3) 
weekend sessions in Warrenton, VA; and five (5) weeknight sessions in 
Washington, D.C. 
 
4.  Eligibility.  Navy Seminar XXI Fellows will be Navy officers (O5-O7) and 
civilians (GS14-15, SES, or equivalent) with clear promotion potential, and 
opportunity to apply these skills in their future assignments in the Navy. 
This application process is open only to individuals serving in Navy 
organizations, in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), or other 
offices without dedicated Seminar XXI quotas attached to commands located 
within a 225-mile driving distance from the National Capital Region for the 
entire period of September 2023 through May 2024.  Navy personnel in 
Government and Defense Agencies with MIT Seminar XXI programs or at the Joint 
Staff must apply through their parent organizations.  Please contact the 
OPNAV N7 POCs listed in this NAVADMIN for questions on eligibility. 
 
5.  Program Specifics.  A total of twelve (12) Navy officers and Civilians 
will be selected for the AY23-24 Seminar XXI fellowships.  Selectees must 
meet minimum attendance requirements and are encouraged to attend every class 
with the full support of their command.  There is no tuition cost to the 
participants or their individual commands, regardless of duty 
station.  However, participants or their commands are responsible for all 
non-tuition expenses, including travel, for Seminar XXI meetings and 
activities. 
 
6.  Admission Process.  For AY23-24, MIT will select a total of 80 personnel 
across the Federal Government.  Of these, 12 will be Navy nominees.  A Navy 
selection panel will choose, from all Navy applicants, those 12 individuals 
with the best combination of experience, accomplishments, and clear potential 
for significant future advancement and leadership positions. 
 
7.  Application Package.  Each nomination package must include the following: 
an application letter including a personal statement, a Curriculum Vitae 
(CV), and two letters of recommendation (one of which should be from the 
individual's reporting senior).  Prospective applicants should contact OPNAV 
N7 to request templates for the required documents.  All applications should 
be submitted by applicants directly to OPNAV N712; copy your ranking 
authority as applicable. 
The deadline for submission of all individual application materials to OPNAV 
N712 is 17 February 2023.  Reserve Officers, please contact OPNAV N095 for 
appropriate guidance, as the reserve process may vary. 
 
8.  Organization Rankings.  Organizations should rank all candidates 
submitting application packages from their command.  Military and civilian 
applicants should be ranked separately, although a combined ranking may also 
be submitted. A template for the ranking memorandum can be requested from the 
N712 POCs. The deadline for rankings, if applicable, is 24 February 2023. 
 
9.  The selection panel will meet in March and nominees will be notified upon 
completion of panel deliberations by early April 2023.  OPNAV N7 will also 
provide the list of the 12 Navy nominees selected by the panel to the MIT 
Seminar XXI Admissions Board by early April 2023.  Navy nominees accepted by
