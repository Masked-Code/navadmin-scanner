RMKS/1. This year's Army/Navy game is scheduled for Saturday,
14 December 2013 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, PA.
CBS Sports Will televise the game and will once again accept
"Go Navy" and/or "Beat Army" video spots from the Navy and Marine
Corps team for broadcast during the game. Additionally, the Navy
office of Information and Defense media activity will push
submitted spots to a variety of media outlets prior to the game
to help generate Esprit de Corps and as a way of highlighting our
naval forces.

2. Requirements: All spots must include the submitting command's name, 
location, and include a "Go Navy" or "Beat Army" theme. Commands
are also encouraged to include the Chief of Naval Operations 
Tenets: Warfighting First, Operate Forward, and Be Ready into the 
theme of their spots. Avoid use of Navy jargon or acronyms that would
not be understood by a broad national audience.

a. Spots must be broadcast quality in one of the following file
or tape formats:
(1) At least 8 mb/s but no more than 100 mb/s and in mxf, mpeg,
wmv, mp4, mov or avi file formats. M4v, flv and swf files are
not accepted.
(2) Tapes/media are accepted, but efforts should focus on 
electronic transmission. Accepted tape/media formats are: cd/dvd, 
Xdcam, hdv, hdcam or dvc pro formats. First-generation tapes only.

b. All submissions must be in high definition (1920x1080 or
1280x720).

c. If intended for CBS, spots must be no more than 30 seconds in
length, while spots intended for social media or other web-only
outlets shall not be longer than two minutes.

d. Submit only ready-to-air spots. Neither CBS nor the Navy Office 
of Information will edit submissions.

3. Recommendations: 

a. High quality Navy branding graphics are available for use in
videos. Contact navymedia(at)navy.mil for more information. Do not 
submit group/command/formation shout outs in which the group is 
shouting a message. Experience has shown that submissions most 
likely to be televised are those with clean, clear audio and 
exhibiting enthusiasm, humor, creativity, and motivation. Inclusion 
of Naval Academy graduates, unique venues, forward deployed locations
and underway scenes are highly encouraged. Spots can not include 
copyrighted or sensitive material, make any official or implied 
endorsements or present commands or the Navy in a negative light.

b. Frame shots according to rules of good composition (avoid
talking heads with no bodies).

c. Good audio quality and sharp focus are paramount. Poor audio
quality was a primary reason for rejection of past entries. Check for
overmodulated audio, weak audio, unclear voices or background noise
prior to submitting.

4. Support from Navy public affairs support elements, defense media
activity detachments or broadcast detachments are permissible on a 
not-to-interfere with operational requirements basis.

5. Commands should send original, broadcast quality footage by
electronic means, express shipment or fastest method available to
the Navy Office of Information (OI-2). Submissions must be received
before 30 November 2013.  Please consider shipping times for overseas
and deployed units. Send to:
U.S. Navy Office of Information
Attn: Damon Moritz
1200 Navy Pentagon, RM 4B514
Washington, DC 20350-1200
Uploads via the Navy imagery server or fast file transfer (FFT) are 
also accepted. Contact navymedia(at)navy.mil with subject line "Army-
Navy transmission request" for file transfer information.

6. Request widest possible dissemination of this message. This is an
excellent means of highlighting Navy teamwork and the spirit of our 
deployed Sailors and Marines. Go Navy, Beat Army!
