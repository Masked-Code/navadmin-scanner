NARR/REF A IS NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 2007 SECTION 516-519.
REF B IS THE JOINT OFFICER MANAGEMENT JOINT QUALIFICATIONS SYSTEM 
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.  REF C IS DRAFT CJCS INSTRUCTION 1330.05 (JOINT 
OFFICER MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES).  REF D IS DRAFT DOD INSTRUCTION
1300.19 (JOINT OFFICER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM).
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN IS THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF MESSAGES TO INFORM 
OFFICERS ABOUT CHANGES TO JOINT OFFICER MANAGEMENT AND QUALIFICATION.
ALL OFFICERS SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THIS MESSAGE AND THE POSTED 
DOCUMENTATION NOTED IN PARA 7.  REF A AUTHORIZED THE SECRETARY OF 
DEFENSE TO _ESTABLISH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF JOINT QUALIFICATION, AS WELL 
AS CRITERIA FOR QUALIFICATION AT EACH LEVEL._  THIS AUTHORITY PRESENTS 
THE DOD WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO UPDATE STATUTORY JOINT OFFICER 
MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND INCORPORATE LESSONS LEARNED FROM OUR JOINT 
WARFIGHTING EXPERIENCE IN THE WAR ON TERRORISM.
2.  PER REF B, OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, DOD, THE JOINT STAFF AND 
SERVICES DEVELOPED REVISIONS TO JOINT OFFICER MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND 
PROCEDURES.  THESE REVISIONS ARE DETAILED IN REFS C AND D, AND WHILE 
NOT FINAL, THEY INCORPORATE THE CHANGES MADE TO U.S. LAW BY REF A.  
SPECIFICALLY, REFS C AND D OUTLINE A JOINT QUALIFICATION SYSTEM (JQS) 
THAT WILL SUPPLEMENT THE EXISTING JOINT SPECIALTY SYSTEM; THIS JQS IS 
EXPECTED TO BECOME EFFECTIVE ON 1 OCTOBER 2007.  THE NEW JQS REPLACES 
THE PREVIOUS DESIGNATION OF JOINT SPECIALTY OFFICER (JSO) WITH THE NEW 
DESIGNATION JOINT QUALIFIED OFFICER (JQO).
3.  THE JQS WILL ALLOW OFFICERS TO GAIN JOINT QUALIFICATION THROUGH A 
COMBINATION OF JOINT EDUCATION, JOINT EXPERIENCE, JOINT TRAINING, OTHER 
CRITERIA (INCLUDING TRAINING AND EXERCISES) AND OTHER MILITARY 
EDUCATION.  UNDER THE JQS:
    A.  OFFICERS WILL STILL REQUIRE JOINT PROFESSIONAL MILITARY 
EDUCATION (JPME) PHASES I AND II FOR DESIGNATION AS A JQO (RESERVISTS 
WILL SUBSTITUTE ADVANCED JPME FOR PHASE II).
    B.  THE PRIMARY MEANS TO ACHIEVE JOINT EXPERIENCE WILL REMAIN 
THROUGH AN ASSIGNMENT TO A JOINT BILLET LISTED ON THE JOINT DUTY 
ASSIGNMENT LIST (JDAL); OFFICERS IN JDAL-BILLETS WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE 
NORMAL TOUR LENGTHS (36 MONTHS FOR O-6 AND BELOW, 24 MONTHS FOR FLAG
OFFICERS).
    C.  OFFICERS MAY ALSO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR DUTY IN A NON-JDAL BILLET 
(SEE PARA 4).
    D.  OFFICERS CURRENTLY DESIGNATED AS JSO WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE 
DESIGNATED AS JQO ON 1 OCTOBER 2007.
    E.  BOTH ACTIVE COMPONENT (AC) AND RESERVE COMPONENT (RC) OFFICERS 
WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR JQO STATUS.
4.  A POINT ACCRUAL FORMULA METHOD WILL BE USED TO ESTABLISH JOINT 
EXPERIENCE.  THIS JQS POINT METHOD TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE FREQUENCY, 
DURATION, ENVIRONMENT, AND INTENSITY OF AN OFFICER_S JOINT EXPERIENCE.
OFFICERS WILL BE ABLE TO SELF-NOMINATE THEIR JOINT ACTIVITIES FOR POINT 
RECOGNITION ON A DEFENSE MANPOWER DATA CENTER (DMDC) WEB SITE BEGINNING 
OCTOBER 2007.
5.  COMPLETING JOINT QUALIFICATIONS WILL REMAIN AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT 
FOR PROMOTION INTO SENIOR LEADERSHIP RANKS.  EFFECTIVE 1 OCTOBER 2008, 
AC OFFICERS MUST BE DESIGNATED AS A JQO PRIOR TO APPOINTMENT TO FLAG 
RANK.
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MAY GRANT EXCEPTIONS/WAIVERS (ON A CASE-BY-
CASE
BASIS) WHEN APPOINTMENT TO FLAG RANK ON A NON-JQO OFFICER IS NECESSARY 
FOR THE GOOD OF THE SERVICE OR WHERE THIS PROMOTION IS BASED ON 
SCIENTIFIC/TECHNICAL/PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR WHICH JOINT 
REQUIREMENTS DO NOT EXIST.  THESE WAIVERS ARE LIKELY ONLY IN UNIQUE, 
EXCEPTIONAL CASES.
6.  OUR NAVY ROUTINELY OPERATES ALONGSIDE OUR SISTER SERVICES, ALLIED 
NATIONS, AS WELL AS GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES.
WORKING
WITH OTHER LIKE-MINDED SERVICES IS OUR NATURE AND WE WILL ONLY DEEPEN 
THIS COOPERATION IN THE FUTURE.  THEREFORE, IT IS CRITICAL THAT OUR 
OFFICERS DEVELOP SKILLS, KNOWLEDGE AND CAPACITY TO EFFECTIVELY FUNCTION 
IN THIS JOINT, INTERAGENCY AND COMBINED ENVIRONMENT.  WITH THE NEW JQS,
OFFICERS MUST ENSURE THAT THEIR RECORDS PROPERLY REFLECT THE TRAINING, 
CAPABILITIES AND EXPERIENCES THEY GAIN FROM THESE ACTIVITIES - AND 
RECEIVE FULL CREDIT FOR THEIR JOINT EXPERIENCE.
7.  OFFICERS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REVIEW THE ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEW JQS THAT CAN BE FOUND ON THE PERS-45J WEB 
SITE AT HTTP://WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/OFFICER/JOINTOFFICER.  IN ADDITION, 
OFFICERS WHO MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR PROMOTION IN THE NEXT YEAR SHOULD 
REVIEW THEIR PAST EXPERIENCE AND PREPARE RELEVENT DOCUMENTATION OF 
THEIR JOINT EXPERIENCE (E.G., AWARDS, FITREPS, ORDERS, ETC) FOR 
SUBMISSION FOR JQS EXPERIENCE POINTS.  OVER THE COMING MONTHS, WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU APPRISED OF NEW INFORMATION ABOUT JOINT OFFICER 
MANAGEMENT AS IT COMES IN.
