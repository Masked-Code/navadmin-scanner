TO USS ALASKA (CB 1).  HOWEVER, USS ALASKA WAS DECOMMISSIONED BEFORE 
THE PURCHASE AND PRESENTATION.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE GOVERNOR OF THE 
TERRITORY OF ALASKA AND THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY AGREED THAT THE BOND 
WOULD BE LEFT ON DEPOSIT IN THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF JUNEAU UNTIL USS 
ALASKA WAS RECOMMISSIONED OR ANOTHER APPROPRIATE APPLICATION OF THESE

SERVICES SCHOLARSHIP FUND.
