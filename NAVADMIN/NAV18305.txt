RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN corrects policy for Combat Zone Tax Exclusion
(CZTE) and Early Promote (EP) Sailors and announces revised selective 
reenlistment bonus (SRB) award levels and reenlistment policy for active 
component (AC) and full-time support (FTS) and supersedes reference (a).  It 
updates the SRB program by adding award levels for 19 skills in 10 ratings, 
increasing award levels for 35 skills in 12 ratings, decreasing award levels 
for 59 skills in 27 ratings, removing award levels for 11 skills in 7 ratings 
and announces the implementation of a pilot program incorporating a pay for 
performance element into the SRB program, in which eligible Sailors can 
receive an additional 0.5 multiple or *kicker* in their SRB multiple if they 
meet specific criteria.  This NAVADMIN also realigns the reenlistment window 
allowing Sailors who are eligible for combat zone tax exclusion and Sailors 
who received an early promote in block 45 of their most recent regular 
periodic evaluation to reenlist within 180 days of their end of active 
obligated service (EAOS).

2.  Increased award levels are effective immediately and decreased levels are 
effective 30 days after the release of this NAVADMIN.
Annual bonus amounts may not exceed $30K per 12 months of additional 
obligated service as stated in reference (b).  Additional bonus calculation 
information can be found at the following website:
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/pages/srb.aspx.

3.  Reenlistment requests for the listed SRB award levels will be approved 
based on quota availability.  SRB reenlistment requests for FTS are currently 
not being accepted.  SRB reenlistment requests for AC must be submitted to 
Community Management Support Branch (BUPERS-
328) via Officer Personnel Information System (OPINS) or Navy Standard 
Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) 35 to 120 days in advance of the 
requested reenlistment date for the Sailor.  Eligible Sailors desiring SRB 
reenlistment are encouraged to work with their chain of command as early as 
possible within their reenlistment window to maximize potential for SRB.  
BUPERS-328 maintains the current list of SRB eligible ratings/skills based on 
available quotas at the following website:  
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/pages/srb.aspx.  Addendums to the current 
award message posted on this site provide notification of skill closures and 
supersede the current NAVADMIN.  For those commands with limited internet 
access, command career counselors
(CCC) should contact BUPERS-328 directly for the latest updates.

4.  AC SRB award levels are as follows (Note:  a * indicates a level located 
in other sections of paragraph 4, a - indicates a reduction from previous 
award level, a + indicates an increase from previous award level):

    b.  Notes
        (1) Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) 0000, commonly referred to as 
quad zero, is listed here to establish that Sailors in these ratings/career 
fields can hold any or no NEC and still be qualified for the SRB provided 
they meet all other applicable non- NEC related criteria.
        (2) Subsurface or surface designation does not mean an individual 
must be subsurface or enlisted surface warfare specialist qualified, but it 
indicates the component of the rating in which they can reasonably be 
expected to serve.  Training, qualifications and previous or projected duty 
assignments at-sea will indicate the appropriate rating component.  When 
using the force management system and OPINS to input a SRB precertification 
request, use the rating (with appropriate suffix designation/NEC) as 
specified in this NAVADMIN.  For example, a surface electronics technician 
with no NEC would submit *ET(SW)* on precertification for rating.
        (3) An SRB approval for all CT, IS, IT and ITS ratings will be 
contingent upon the Sailor having a current single scope background 
investigation (SSBI) or Tier 5 investigation, an active SSBI/Tier 5 or recent 
submission of a SSBI/Tier 5 package.  Commands must verify the Sailor has a 
current SSBI/Tier 5, active SSBI/Tier 5 or has submitted a SSBI/Tier 5 
package and make note of this in the comments section of the precertification 
request.
        (4) E-3 to E-6 Sailors only.  Sailors selected for E-7 advancement 
are not eligible for SRB.
        (5) X is used as a placeholder to identify where multiple NECs within 
a rating are eligible for a stated award level.  Sailors in the specified 
rating that hold an NEC that includes the numbers preceding X are eligible 
for SRB.  For example, SO O9XA includes SO O91A and SO O92A or T1XB includes 
all subsurface electronics technician navigation NECs contained in T1XA 
series.
        (6) Reenlistment bonuses for nuclear-trained Sailors.
            (a) Reenlistment compensation for zones 1 through 3 nuclear-
trained Sailors holding a nuclear supervisor NEC shall be provided under the 
enlisted supervisor retention pay (ESRP) program in line with policies and 
procedures detailed in reference (c) along with current ESRP multiples.
            (b) SRB entitlement for eligible nuclear-trained Sailors who 
reenlist after applying for an officer program will be held pending selection 
results.  For nuclear-trained Sailors only, the date on which conditional 
release is approved by Nuclear Propulsion Program Manager (OPNAV N133) as 
directed in reference (d) is considered the date of the application to an 
officer program with the exception of Seaman to Admiral 21 nuclear option 
(STA-21(N)) and Limited Duty Officer (LDO).  For STA-21(N) and LDO, the 
application deadline is considered the suspense date.
        (7) E-4 to E-6 Sailors only.  Sailors selected for E-7 advancement 
are not eligible for SRB.
        (8) E-3 to E-5 Sailors only.  Sailors selected for E-6 advancement 
are not eligible for SRB.
        (9) FCA 0000 SRB eligibility contingent upon graduation of an FCA NEC 
awarding "C" school.
        (10) Sailors holding a CTI NEC must be differentiated by enlisted 
manning code (EMC).  Only Sailors having one of the following NECs and 
assigned in the respective EMC are eligible for
SRB:
            (a) NEC:  9SPA, EMC:  B515
            (b) NEC:  813A/9RUS, EMC:  B516
            (c) NEC:  9ARB/9PES, EMC:  B511
            (d) NEC:  9CMN, EMC:  B512
        (11) Sailors are eligible for a +0.5 pay for performance SRB kicker 
contingent upon meeting all requirements specified in paragraph 6 below.
        (12) For Submarine (SS) Sailors only.

5.  Sailors must reenlist within 180 days of their EAOS, except in the 
following cases:
    a.  Nuclear-trained Sailors.
    b.  Sailors who must OBLISERV to execute a permanent change of station 
move will be allowed to reenlist early any time within one calendar year of 
the detachment month, but not later than the date of detachment from the last 
intermediate duty station.
    c.  CZTE and EP Sailors who submitted SRB requests on or before the 
release of NAVADMIN 302/18 will be grandfathered under paragraph
5 of reference (e).

6.  Pay for performance is a Sailor 2025 initiative and is being piloted as 
part of a talent management process improvement effort.
Eligibility and submission requirements are as follows:
    a.  To be eligible for the pay for performance SRB Pilot Sailors
must:
        (1) Be in the EM, EN, GSM, MM(SW), DC, HT or MR rating.
        (2) Have received two early promotes in block 45 of their three most 
recent regular (Block 8) periodic evaluations (Block 10).
No transfer, concurrent or special evaluations will apply.
        (3) Have not received non-judicial punishment within the last 3 
years.
        (4) Have not failed any part of the physical fitness assessment in 
the last 3 years.
    b.  Commands must submit a 1306 requesting the SRB kicker, signed copies 
of the evaluations of the Sailor and a printout of their physical readiness 
information management system data to
BUPERS-328 once their precertification has been submitted.  This requirement 
is only for those that fall under the provisions of this paragraph.
    c.  Award ceiling cap values under $100,000 will be raised by
$5,000 for Sailors eligible for the performance kicker.  For
example:  EN Zone A award ceiling will be raised from $30,000 to
$35,000 for Sailors who qualify for the performance kicker.  Award ceiling 
caps will not be adjusted over $100,000 under these provisions.

7.  SRB Submission Requirements
    a.  Commands are required to submit SRB reenlistment requests to
BUPERS-328 via OPINS or NSIPS 35 to 120 days in advance of the requested 
reenlistment date of the Sailor.  Requests submitted less than 35 days prior 
to the requested reenlistment date will be rejected.  However, commands may 
contact BUPERS-328 for waiver eligibility and procedures.  Sailors must have 
an approved SRB request before reenlisting.  The servicing personnel office 
is responsible for verifying the reenlistment, posting the contract, 
releasing the first payment and verifying the master military pay account.  
Commands shall immediately notify OPNAV N130 when a Sailor fails to maintain 
eligibility in the skill for which SRB was paid (e.g., loss of security 
clearance, medical disqualification, loss of eligible NEC, misconduct) or 
when a Sailor has an approved separation with a remaining SRB contract 
obligation.
    b.  Career Waypoints - Reenlistment (C-WAY-REEN).  Commands are 
authorized to submit SRB reenlistment requests prior to a Sailor receiving a 
C-WAY-REEN quota.  However, the C-WAY-REEN quota request must be submitted.  
In these cases, the SRB request will not be processed until the Sailor has 
received C-WAY-REEN confirmation.
SRB requests without C-WAY-REEN quota approval will be rejected in OPINS to 
keep the command informed of potential SRB approval issues.
Once a Sailor has an approved C-WAY-REEN quota, the command should contact 
BUPERS-328 to clear any rejections.  Failure to submit a SRB reenlistment 
request within the required 35 to 120-day submission window due to awaiting a 
C-WAY-REEN quota does not meet eligibility requirements for a 35-day 
submission waiver.
    c.  Sailors with approved SRB requests who do not reenlist on the date or 
for the term specified in the precertification message must have their 
command contact BUPERS-328 to initiate a reenlistment cancellation to avoid 
placing Sailors in an overpaid status.
    d.  To validate an inoperative extension of enlistment and expedite 
processing of an SRB request, include the following information in the 
remarks paragraph of the request:  term, narrative reason, authority and 
execution date of all inoperative extensions.  Failure to verify extension 
will cause processing delays and may result in rejection of the request or an 
approval at a lower amount.
    e.  Sailors must obtain an approval for extension from BUPERS-
328 in order to minimize the potential for loss of SRB eligibility.

8.  Acceptance of an NEC-specific SRB contract indicates an agreement between 
the Sailor and the Navy to use skills attributed to the NEC during the 
enlistment of the Sailor to meet fleet readiness requirements.  In subsequent 
tours, a Sailor must be willing to be detailed during the normal projected 
rotation date window to an available billet within the SRB contracted NEC, 
consistent with sea-shore flow requirements.  Lateral conversions must follow 
reference (f), paragraph 12d.  Lateral conversion requests will normally not 
be processed more than nine months before the EAOS.  Conversions to a rate 
with a lower award level normally will not be approved.  Personnel in a 
closed-loop NEC can reenlist by the NEC only.

9.  Reference (f), paragraph 12e, provides OBLISERV to Train (OTT) guidance.  
Requests are to be submitted to BUPERS-328 extension desk via e-mail.  A copy 
of the authorization message should be retained by the Sailor until the SRB 
reenlistment on graduation day from the course of instruction.  Use code 1CC 
for OTT SRB request in OPINS or NSIPS.  Additionally, OBLISERV requirements 
for schools are provided in reference (g).  OBLISERV will be determined based 
on the course length as provided in paragraph 3b of reference (g).  Paragraph
3c(1) no longer applies.

10.  In keeping with Department of Defense (DoD) policy, Sailors who accepted 
an enlistment bonus for extended enlistment (EBEE), as reflected on their 
Enlisted Bonus Payment Checklist (NAVCRUIT 1133/52, Enlistment Guarantees, 
New Accession Training Program Enlistment Guarantee or Professional 
Apprenticeship Career Track Program Enlistment Guarantees), are not 
authorized to use this inoperative extension time in the SRB calculation.  
Sailors who have inoperative extension time through a 5-year obligation or 6-
year obligation program may continue to have up to 24 months of inoperative 
extension time count towards the SRB calculation provided the reenlistment 
results in a new EAOS that is at least 24 months day-for-day past the current 
extended EAOS.  This calculation is performed automatically by BUPERS-328.  
Local commands are not authorized to cancel or change extensions for the 
purpose of immediate SRB reenlistments.  Commands must verify and annotate on 
the precertification request whether any inoperative extension time noted is 
part of an EBEE contract.

11.  Repayment policy is governed by section 373 of Title 37 U.S.
Code, Chapter 2, Volume 7A, of the DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR) 
and reference (f), which collectively determines when repayment of the 
unearned portion of a bonus is required or not required but left to 
Secretarial discretion or prohibited.  Section
373 of Title 37 U.S. Code requires repayment with certain exceptions.  As a 
general rule, repayment of any unearned portion of a bonus will be sought.

12.  To ensure all requirements and timelines are met, visit the following 
SRB page of the Navy Personnel Command website at 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/
Pages/SRB.aspx.

13.  The point of contact for a Sailor who has reenlisted and has not 
received their SRB payment or has questions concerning the taxation of their 
SRB and annual installments, is the servicing pay office or personnel support 
detachment of the Sailor.  SRB tax information is also discussed in DoD FMR, 
Volume 7A, Chapter 44, table 44-1, rule 7.  The point of contact for a Sailor 
with questions regarding the SRB program or any information on their on- line 
personnel account is their CCC.  For technical questions or clarification, 
CCCs, not individual Sailors, are encouraged to contact the Community 
Management Support Branch, BUPERS-328, at
(901) 874-3215 or (901) 874-3915/DSN 882 or via e-mail at 
mill_incen_pays(at)navy.mil or contact the SRB Help Desk at (901) 874-
2526/DSN 882.

14.  We will continue to assess retention behavior and adjust SRB award 
levels accordingly.

15.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
