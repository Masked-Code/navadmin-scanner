ONE AND SEASON TWO.  REF B IS NAVADMIN 201/20, PROFESSIONAL MILITARY 
KNOWLEDGE ELIGIBILITY EXAM REVISED BUSINESS RULES.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN replaces reference (a) and announces the policy and 
guidance for calendar year (CY) 2021 Season One Meritorious Advancement 
Program (MAP) for Active and Full-Time Support Sailors.  Due to the 
successful implementation of the MAP automation in Navy Standard Integrated 
Personnel System (NSIPS) and positive Fleet feedback, the time allocated for 
commands to approve MAP candidates during CY21 MAP Season One will remain 45 
days, beginning on 1 March through 15 April 2021.

2.  In order to preserve advancement opportunity via the Navy Wide 
Advancement Exam (NWAE) and control over-manning a particular rating and 
paygrade, MAP advancement to the BM3, ABF2, ABF1, ABH3 and ABH2 rates will be 
controlled in line with this NAVADMIN.  The decision to control these rates 
was made based on a variety of factors, to include low NWAE advancement 
opportunity and proportionality of total MAP advancements in each community.  
For details on MAP advancements in controlled rates, refer to paragraph 5 
below.

3.  MAP will account for approximately 20 percent of total advancements in 
CY21 with roughly half of the available quotas allocated for each season.  
All unused quotas will be factored into the NWAE cycle.  We are maintaining 
the two-season framework that aligns the MAP with the NWAE to emphasize the 
intent of MAP in selecting and rewarding the right Sailors.

4.  MAP within NSIPS.  Commands are required to submit their MAP advancement 
through NSIPS.  NSIPS Web Afloat users and commands without access to NSIPS 
should refer to paragraph 4a for instructions on submitting their MAP 
advancements.  The system will use authoritative data to determine 
eligibility.  However, commands are still required to locally validate that 
MAP candidates have successfully completed the Professional Military 
Knowledge Eligibility Examination (PMK-EE) requirement prior to the first day 
of the MAP season, as outlined in reference (b).
    a.  NSIPS Web Afloat Users and Users Without Access to NSIPS.
NSIPS Web Afloat users and commands without access to NSIPS must submit a MAP 
nomination request via e-mail directly to their ISIC, type commander (TYCOM) 
or budget submitting office (BSO)/echelon II command using the Meritorious 
Certification Letter (MCL).  The letter must be signed by the commanding 
officer and should address any exceptions to policy (ETP) and/or additional 
quotas requested.
Sample MCLs and detailed information regarding the offline process can be 
found via MyNavy Portal (MNP) at the *MAP* tab and then select the *MCL 
Template* and *Offline Process*.
    b.  Quota usage, modifications and distribution will be managed within 
the NSIPS environment.  BSO and command quotas will be uploaded into NSIPS on 
15 February 2021 and can be found under the quota summary report tab.  Quotas 
can also be found via MNP at the
*MAP* tab and then select the *MAP Quotas*.
    c.  Additional quotas can be requested using the quota request option.  
Commands must contact their BSO to determine timeline for additional quota 
requests.  All commands are authorized to request quotas from their 
BSO/echelon II command, via their ISIC and TYCOM, whether or not command 
quotas are authorized.
    d.  The system will automatically determine if an ETP is required using 
predetermined criteria.  Service Members in ratings requiring security 
clearances and rates/pay grades requiring time in rate (TIR) waivers will be 
automatically routed for adjudication.
The request will be routed through the ISIC, TYCOM and BSO/echelon II command 
using a hierarchical workflow.
    e.  Nuclear-trained Service Members.  NSIPS will not automatically 
generate an ETP.  If a command desires to advance a nuclear-trained Service 
Member not meeting the TIR, an ETP must be routed to Director, Military 
Personnel Plans and Policy (OPNAV N13) via Nuclear Program Manager (OPNAV 
N133).  E-5s require a TIR date of 1 January 2019 or earlier to be eligible 
for advancement to E-6.

5.  MAP Advancements in Controlled Rates.  Commands desiring to MAP advance a 
Sailor to ABF1, ABF2, ABH2, ABH3 or BM3 must submit a request to their BSO, 
via their ISIC and TYCOM, using the quota request option in NSIPS.  If the 
command does not have access to NSIPS, they should follow the procedures in 
paragraph 4a.  BSOs will be granted MAP quotas for each rate based on the 
proportion of the billets authorized (BA) at the lower paygrade of that rate 
under that BSO.  If there are not enough quotas for all BSOs with BA for the 
lower paygrade, the quotas will be allocated to the BSOs with the largest 
amount of BA for the lower paygrade.  BSOs will be contacted by BUPERS-32 to 
inform them of how many of their assigned quotas shall be used only for the 
specified rates.  Commands will submit requests to the BSOs using the 
template provided on the MAP homepage via MNP at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-
promotion/a-enlisted-advancement-resources-and-links, then select the 
*Websites* tab in the blue banner.

6.  MAP Website.  MAP Quotas by Unit Identification Code (UIC), as well as 
example forms and frequently asked questions can be found on MNP at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/a-
enlisted-advancement-resources-and-links, then select the *Websites* tab in 
the blue banner.  The list of points of contact for each BSO/echelon II 
command and list of parent and subordinate UICs can also be found on this 
website.

7.  Point of contact is MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) at (833) 330-
6622 or via email at askmncc(at)navy.mil.

8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
