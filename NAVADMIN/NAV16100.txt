SUBJ/FY-16 FULL TIME SUPPORT AVIATION CAREER CONTINUATION PAY//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the FY-16 Full Time Support (FTS) Aviation 
Career Continuation Pay (ACCP) program.  A vital part of developing a total 
force strategy and maintaining combat readiness is to provide appropriate 
incentives to retain skilled personnel for critical naval aviation enterprise 
billets.  The FTS program provides selected bonuses as an incentive to 
eligible pilots and Naval Flight Officers (NFOs) through department head (DH) 
billets.

that is tied directly to force structure and targets eligible DH aviators.

for squadron DH.  DH retention bonuses will be paid in equal annual 
installments.  The following rates are for squadron department head/wing
