Training.  USS CONSTITUTION, located in Boston, Massachusetts, will host 
Fiscal Year 2019 CPO Selectees from 19-24 August and 26-31 August 2018.

2.  CPO Selectees will work aboard "Old Ironsides" for five days and four 
nights, where they will be immersed in more than 200 years of naval heritage 
while learning about the art of sailing, construction of the ship while she 
is docked, handling 19th century guns, and man her gigs.  The training will 
culminate in a gig race in Boston Harbor commemorating the July 1812 chase of 
the ship by a British squadron.

3.  USS CONSTITUTION will host 120 CPO Selectees and 23 Mentor Chiefs each 
week.  Request Fleet and Force Master Chiefs provide nominations to the Chief 
of Naval Operations Coordinator listed in this message, with the following 
subject line, "USS CONSTITUTION HERITAGE WEEK NOMINATION".  Mentor 
nominations are due by close of business (COB) 31 May 2018; Reserve CPO 
Selectee and Active CPO Selectee nominations are due one week following the 
release of the respective selection board results.  All quotas and staffing 
are coordinated through the OPNAV coordinator; do not contact USS 
CONSTITUTION directly for quotas or billet confirmation, use the same subject 
line for all nominations.

4.  Attendee costs for this OPNAV-authorized, mission essential training 
event are to be borne from attendee unit training funds.  Unit Commanding 
Officers shall determine whether CPO's/CPO Selectees assigned to their unit 
should attend, taking into account the availability of unit training funds.

requirements will be emailed to all participants once their attendance has 
been confirmed.
