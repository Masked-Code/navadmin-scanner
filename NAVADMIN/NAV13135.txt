RMKS/1.  This message applies to all Navy personnel, uniformed and civilian.  Echelon II commanders 
and all regional commanders shall ensure widest dissemination to all subordinate and tenant commands
and detachments for immediate action upon receipt.  

2.  The following Geographic Areas of Interest (GAOI) have been established  for the OKLAHOMA 
TORNADO:
    a.  Oklahoma:
        (1) The following counties in the state of Oklahoma are in the GAOI: Cleveland, Oklahoma, and 
Pottawatomie. 

3.  All commands are expected to:
    a.  Muster and account for all affected personnel, including applicable family members.  Commanding 
officers (COS) and/or commanding officers representatives (CORS) are to determine accurate status and 
whereabouts of their personnel and muster and account for them at current residence, displaced 
location, or not in the  GAOI with specified circumstance (deployed, TDY/TAD/IA, on leave,
separated/retired, transferred, UA/deserter, other).  In doing so, an accurate accounting of all personnel 
in all accounting categories can be quickly determined.
    b.  COS and/or CORS utilize the Navy Family Accountability and Assessment System (NFAAS) support 
site at https://navyfamily.navy.mil to account for each individual required to be reported per refs
(a) and (b).
    c.  Individuals or family members not able to contact their command can log on to NFAAS at 
https://navyfamily.navy.mil and check in (muster) on the Navy family members site.  If unable to log on 
to NFAAS, call the NFAAS help desk at 866-946-9183.
    d.  If NFAAS is not available, commands are to report the status of personnel accountability (PA) to the 
affected Region Operations Center (ROC) or direct chain of command.
    e.  Do not delay reporting on personnel until all information is complete.  Report and account 
mustering information when obtained including the posting of amplifying data in the notes area on the
individual's accounting line.

4.  Commands executing evacuation procedures are responsible for issuing TDY evacuation orders for 
their personnel, military and civilian employees, and family members using DOD Form 1610.  Military 
members departing the area being evacuated are on TDY status and will receive normal TDY allowances.  
Command's day-to-day operations funding source is to be used per ref (d).  For civilian employees and 
family members of military and civilian personnel, the funding accounting data is outlined in refs (e) and 
(f).

5.  Displaced personnel who have been ordered to evacuate by military authority, can email the Navy 
Pay and Personnel Support Center  (NPPSC), Norfolk, VA at evacuations(at)navy.mil for evacuation travel 
related questions.
    a.  The decision of local civil officials to evacuate an area is  not sufficient for DOD reimbursement 
entitlements.  The appropriate  military official must authorize/order an evacuation as local civil
officials cannot obligate the expenditure of DOD funds.
    b.  Commands will designate safe havens for evacuated personnel.
    c.  Upon arrival at the designated safe haven, all personnel  muster in accordance with parent 
command direction.

6.  Navy families who were severely impacted by the OKLAHOMA TORNADO are strongly encouraged to 
log into NFAAS, https://navyfamily.navy.mil, to update contact information and complete a needs
assessment form at their earliest convenience after storm passage.  For further assistance after a needs 
assessment form has been submitted, call Navy Personnel Command Emergency Coordination Center
(NPC ECC) at 877-414-5358 or e-mail npc.cat.captain(at)navy.mil.

7.  For PA questions or concerns, contact the point of contacts below for your chain of command (read
