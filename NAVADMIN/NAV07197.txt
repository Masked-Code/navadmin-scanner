SUBJ/STAY NAVY CAMPAIGN - COMMAND SPONSOR AND INDOC PROGRAMS// 
REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/03DEC06// AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1040.11B GOVERNING 
NAVY RETENTION AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS//
RMKS/1.  THIS IS THE SECOND OF A RECURRING SERIES OF MESSAGES DESIGNED 
TO ENCOURAGE OUR SAILORS TO STAY NAVY.  THE SPECIFIC FOCUS OF THIS 
MESSAGE IS THE COMMAND SPONSOR AND INDOCTRINATION PROGRAMS.
COMMAND SPONSOR AND INDOCTRINATION PROGRAMS ARE THE COMMAND S FIRST 
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE THAT IT CARES ABOUT THE WELL-BEING, CAREER 
PROGRESSION, PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND FAMILY SUPPORT 
OF THEIR SAILORS.  EMPHASIS OF THESE VALUES, ESPECIALLY WITH MORE 
JUNIOR SAILORS, IS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR FUTURE AND CRITICALLY IMPORTANT 
TO SUCCESSFUL TOUR COMPLETION FOR THE SAILOR AND ULTIMATELY THE 
READINESS OF THE NAVY.
2.  SPONSOR/INDOC PROGRAMS: AS WE FACE THE CHALLENGE OF RECRUITING IN A 
MARKET WITH DECREASING NUMBERS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO JOIN 
OUR NAVY, WE CAN ILL AFFORD TO DEMOTIVATE THEM WITH INADEQUATE 
SPONSOR/INDOC PROGRAMS.  ALTHOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF SOLID SPONSOR/INDOC 
PROGRAMS IS OFTEN REPEATED, FEEDBACK FROM A RECENT NAVY COUNSELOR 
SYMPOSIUM INDICATED THAT THESE BEDROCK PROGRAMS HAVE ROOM FOR 
IMPROVEMENT IN SOME COMMANDS.  THEREFORE, PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF 
INBOUND SAILORS, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT COMMAND LEADERSHIP ENSURE THE 
SMOOTH TRANSITION OF ALL NEW SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES.
THE IMPORTANCE OF ASSIGNING A SPONSOR TO EVERY INBOUND SAILOR AND 
NOTIFYING THEM OF THEIR SPONSOR S CONTACT INFORMATION EITHER IN A  
WELCOME ABOARD  PACKAGE OR MESSAGE CANNOT BE OVER EMPHASIZED.
THROUGH INTERACTION WITH HIS/HER SPONSOR, MANY ISSUES AND CONCERNS CAN 
BE RESOLVED BEFORE THE SAILOR S ARRIVAL ONBOARD.  A PROACTIVE SPONSOR 
PROGRAM MUST BE FOLLOWED BY AN EFFECTIVE INDOCTRINATION PROCESS.  A 
WELL-THOUGHT OUT INDOC PROCESS SENDS A STRONG POSITIVE SIGNAL THE 
COMMAND CARES ABOUT THEIR SAILORS  SUCCESS AND EXPEDITES THEIR 
CONTRIBUTION IN THE LONG RUN.  A GOOD SPONSOR/INDOC PROGRAM, COUPLED 
WITH AN INDIVIDUALIZED CAREER DEVELOPMENT BOARD WITHIN 30 DAYS (PER 
GUIDANCE OUTLINED IN REF A), PROVIDES A SAILOR WITH A GOOD START TOWARD 
CAREER DEVELOPMENT, GREATER MISSION CONTRIBUTION AND HIGHER RETENTION.
3.  CAREER DEVELOPMENT TOOLS: RECENT IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CAREER 
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (CIMS) CAN ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 
YOUR EXISTING PROGRAMS.  THESE ENHANCEMENTS ALLOW THE GAINING COMMAND 
TO VIEW ORDERS ON ALL INBOUND SAILORS AND ASSIGN A SPONSOR INCLUDING 
THE SPONSOR S PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PHONE NUMBER AND E-MAIL ADDRESS.  
ONCE THIS INFORMATION IS ENTERED INTO CIMS, THE LOSING COMMAND WILL BE 
ABLE TO ACCESS THE SPONSOR S CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THEIR OUTBOUND 
SAILORS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CIMS, VISIT (LOWER CASE) 
HTTPS://NSIPS.NMCI.NAVY.MIL.
4.  BEST PRACTICES:  THE COMMAND SPONSORSHIP AND INDOCTRINATION 
PROGRAMS ON BOARD USS RUSSELL (DDG 59), HOMEPORTED IN PEARL HARBOR, 
HAWAII, ARE EXAMPLES FOR EVERY COMMAND TO FOLLOW.  THE COMMAND SPONSOR 
COORDINATOR INFORMATION IS POSTED AND UPDATED IN THE SPONSOR ASSIGNMENT 
AID TOOL IN THE STAY NAVY SECTION OF THE NPC WEBSITE (LOWER CASE) 
HTTPS://STAYNAVYTOOLS.BOL.NAVY.MIL/SAA/, AND IS ALSO LISTED IN THE 
ULTIMATE DUTY STATION SECTION ON EACH SET OF ORDERS.  ONCE THE SHIP 
RECEIVES ORDERS, THE SPONSOR COORDINATOR SENDS OUT A MESSAGE TO THE 
PROSPECTIVE SAILOR LISTING COMMAND AND SPONSOR CONTACT INFORMATION.  
THE COMMAND ALSO ENSURES OMBUDSMAN INFORMATION IS LISTED IN THE MESSAGE 
AND IS PART OF A MAILED  WELCOME ABOARD  PACKAGE.  INFORMATION RELATED 
TO THE SPONSOR IS ALSO DOCUMENTED IN CIMS (PER PARA 3 ABOVE).  COMMAND 
LEADERSHIP IS UPDATED AT RUSSELL'S WEEKLY PB4T.  THE SHIP'S COMMAND 
INDOCTRINATION RUNS FOR 2 WEEKS AND INCORPORATES THE CAREER DEVELOPMENT 
TRAINING COURSE (CDTC) AND THE FIRST TERM SUCCESS WORKSHOP, AS WELL AS 
BASIC DAMAGE CONTROL AND SHIPBOARD FIRE FIGHTING.  ALL SAILORS WHO PASS 
A PRACTICAL TEST AND ORAL BOARD ARE QUALIFIED UP TO DC-306 LEVEL.  NOT 
ONLY DOES RUSSELL S INDOC PROGRAM GIVE THEIR SAILORS A HEAD START ON 
QUALIFICATIONS, BUT ALSO SETS THE RIGHT TONE FOR CAREER SUCCESS.
5.  OTHER STAY NAVY NEWS:  THE NAVY COUNSELOR ASSOCIATION (NCA) HELD 
ITS ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM IN DALLAS 25-29 JUNE, ATTENDED BY OVER 800 COMMAND 
CAREER COUNSELORS AND OTHER RETENTION TEAM LEADERS (INCLUDING COMMAND 
MASTER CHIEFS).  THE SYMPOSIUM PROVIDED A SUPERB FORUM FOR UPDATING 
ATTENDEES ON A WIDE RANGE OF MANPOWER, PERSONNEL, TRAINING AND 
EDUCATION (MPTE) PROGRAMS AND THE CURRENT MPTE STRATEGY.  ADDITIONALLY, 
IT WAS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR SENIOR MPTE LEADERS TO INTERACT AND 
OBTAIN FEEDBACK FROM FLEET CAREER COUNSELORS.  COMMAND SUPPORT OF 
ATTENDANCE BY THOSE INVOLVED WITH THE PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SAILORS IS ENCOURAGED EACH YEAR VIA NAVADMIN MESSAGE 
(THIS YEAR BY NAVADMIN 076/07).  THE NEXT NCA SYMPOSIUM WILL BE HELD 
FROM 25-29 JULY 2008 IN SAN DIEGO.  PLEASE MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO SEND A 
COMMAND REPRESENTATIVE.
