RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN revises the 2012 Navy Diversity Policy Coordination 
instruction, reference (a), and incorporates the Office of Inclusion and 
Diversity under the Twenty First Century Sailor Office (OPNAV N17).  
Inclusion and Diversity is a line of effort in the Chief of Naval Operations 
Culture of Excellence (COE) Campaign, which empowers the Navy to achieve 
warfighting excellence by fostering psychological, physical and emotional 
toughness.  Ensuring inclusion and connectedness among every Sailor, family 
member and Navy civilian promotes organizational trust and transparency 
throughout their Navy journey.  Every Active and Reserve Sailor and civilian 
brings a unique set of skills to our team.  Actively seeking out and 
leveraging these skills is key to reaching our maximum warfighting potential.

2.  This new approach operationalizes the guidance in references (b) through 
(q) by promulgating specific roles and responsibilities and including 
Inclusion and Diversity as a line of effort within the COE Campaign Plan.  
Without inclusion, diverse perspectives can lead to friction/conflict in 
thoughts and opinions.  All perspectives must be actively included to harness 
the creative power of diversity, accelerating our Navys warfighting 
advantage.

3.  Inclusion and Diversity Goals
    a.  Goal 1:  Institutionalize Inclusion and Diversity across our Navy.
b.  Goal 2:  Attract and recruit the best talent from our diverse nation to 
cultivate a high-performing and innovative workforce.
    c.  Goal 3:  Develop and retain Sailors and Navy civilians by ensuring an 
inclusive culture across our workforce.

    d.  Inclusion and Diversity Council:  Semi-annual Inclusion and Diversity

Navy leaders and key workforce stakeholders chaired by the Vice Chief of 
Naval Operations (VCNO) to coordinate, align and make decisions regarding 
Navy Inclusion and Diversity programs and policies.
