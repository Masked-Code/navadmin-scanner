REF B IS BUPERSINST 1610.10F, NAVY PERFORMANCE EVALUATION SYSTEM.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the continuing availability of NAVFIT98A for 
use as an alternative to eNavFit for the completion of performance 
evaluations through 31 December 2025.
     a.  eNavFit was designed to be a bridge to future performance evaluation 
modernization, and continues to undergo necessary programming updates in 
preparation for additional Fleet testing to enable full access and 
functionality.
    b.  Since the rollout of eNavFit, thousands of performance appraisals 
have been successfully submitted via eNavFit both online and offline.
    c.  The rejection rate for evaluations generated and submitted via 
eNavFit is 19% lower than the traditional evaluation system.
    d.  eNavFit processing time is exponentially faster than the traditional 
evaluation system, which means reports get uploaded to a Sailor's Official 
Military Personnel File sooner.
    e.  While numerous fixes and enhancements have been implemented since 
eNavFit was first introduced, there is still work to do to achieve full Navy-
wide implementation.

2.  Commands that have had success with eNavFit are encouraged to keep using 
the system as a means to more efficiently process Sailors' evaluation 
transactions, to familiarize Sailors with modernized BUPERS Online document 
services, and to identify any further stress points within the applications.

3.  For questions concerning NAVFIT98A and eNavFit, contact the MyNavy Career 
Center at (833) 833-6622 or via e-mail at askmncc@navy.mil.

4. This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or cancelled, 
whichever occurs first.
