SUBJ//UNIFORM NATIONAL DISCHARGE STANDARDS INFORMATIONAL BRIEFINGS//

RMKS/1.  This message announces the schedule of informational briefings for 
compliance with upcoming Uniform National Discharge Standards (UNDS) 
regulations.

2.  Background.
  a.  In the upcoming months, Navy vessels (USS, USNS, combatant
  craft, service craft, boats, and any other artificial contrivance)
  will be required to comply with new UNDS for the following eleven
  discharges:
    (1) Aqueous Film-Forming Foam
    (2) Chain Locker Effluent
    (3) Distillation and Reverse Osmosis Brine
    (4) Elevator Pit Effluent
    (5) Gas Turbine Water Wash
    (6) Non Oily Machinery Wastewater
    (7) Photographic Laboratory Drains
    (8) Seawater Cooling Overboard Discharge
    (9) Seawater Piping Biofouling Prevention
    (10) Small Boat Engine Wet Exhaust
    (11) Welldeck Discharges
  b.  A DoD Instruction will implement the UNDS regulations.  When
  that instruction is issued, another NAVADMIN will be promulgated to
  announce the issuance.  In the interim, all commands are highly
  encouraged to send appropriate representatives to the training
  advertised below.
  c.  Existing Navy operations should already be in compliance with
  most of the discharge standards through the use of current systems
  and practices. However, the new regulations will impose some
  additional reporting, information logging, and record-keeping
  responsibilities.  These include, but are not limited to:
    (1) All Commands that own or operate one or more vessels will be
    required to assign an UNDS Person in Charge (PIC) who will be
    responsible for ensuring compliance with the UNDS discharge
    regulations as well as all UNDS reporting and recordkeeping
    requirements.  For larger vessels, the UNDS PIC duties are expected
    to be assigned to the ship's Commanding Officer (CO) or vessel
    master; for smaller vessels, a single person can be assigned PIC
    duties for multiple vessels.
    (2) Vessels that inadvertently make a discharge that does not
    comply with the UNDS must submit an UNDS non-compliance
    report.  Additionally, discharge specific records will be required
    for certain discharges such as chain locker effluent and small boat
    engine wet exhaust.
  d.  UNDS regulations are federal regulations, based on the federal
  Clean Water Act.  It is imperative that all Navy vessels are in full
  compliance with these regulations as failure to comply could result
  in civil actions against the Navy or criminal prosecution.
  e.  The UNDS regulations may be enforced by U.S. Coast Guard or
  State officials.  If such officials request access to vessels or
  records, follow the procedures in OPNAV M-5090.1, Chapter 35, and
  coordinate with the Regional Environmental Coordinator (REC).
  f.  To assist commands in complying with the UNDS regulations,
  OPNAV will provide informational briefings as laid out
  below.  Scheduling of some meetings is still in progress.  Request
  appropriate personnel (PIC, maintenance, repair, operations) attend
  one of these sessions, as subject-matter experts will be on hand to
  answer questions.
