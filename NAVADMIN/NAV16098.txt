RMKS/1.  The Navy is pleased to announce the selection of the following 
Sailors for training and assignment as the second group of enlisted female 
submariners.  The interest in this program was strong, and selection was 
highly competitive.  Consistent superior performance, operational experience, 
and strong command endorsements were critical in breaking out these high 
performing Sailors from their peers.

2.  Congratulations to the following Sailors who were selected to be assigned 
to USS FLORIDA homeported in Kings Bay, GA:

3.  Primary selectees must contact Commander, Submarine Force Atlantic 
(COMSUBLANT FORCE) Medical as soon as possible to ensure their submarine duty 
physical is completed in accordance with reference (a) and processed by an 
undersea medical officer (UMO) within 30 days of the DTG of this message.
    a.  COMSUBLANT FORCE independent duty corpsman (IDC) (Norfolk,VA): 757-
836-1351/1354. If you are unable to contact the COMSUBLANT FORCE IDC, contact 
the COMSUBPAC Force IDC (Pearl Harbor, HI):  808-473-1479/5788.
    b.  The Report of Medical History (DD Form 2807-1) and Report of Medical 
Examination (DD Form 2808) may be completed by any Department of Defense 
privileged provider (Medical Doctor, Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine, 
Physicians Assistant, Nurse Practitioner); however, a UMO is required to 
bottom line the overall submarine duty physical on DD Form 2808 (Block 84a).

4.  Enlisted Nuclear/Submarine Assignment (PERS-403) will contact primary 
selectees within the next 30 days to arrange for transfer to Basic Enlisted 
Submarine School to commence the submarine training pipeline. Depending on 
the rating for which they were selected, Sailors can expect to detach from 
their current commands from as early as Fall 2016 to as late as Spring 2017.

5.  Congratulations to the following Sailors also selected, who may be 
contacted to convert to submarines if a primary selectee is unable to report 
as assigned:

6.  Sailors listed in paragraph 5 above may be called upon within 90 days to 
fill an assignment on USS FLORIDA if a primary selectee does not pass their 
submarine physical or is otherwise determined to be ineligible for assignment 
onboard submarines.

7.  The selections for nuclear-trained personnel will be made late summer 
2017.  Each USS FLORIDA crew will have 2 previous junior staff instructors 
(JSI) (any nuclear rating) and 4 prototype graduates (one from each nuclear 
rating).  These Sailors will transfer to the submarine from the nuclear power 
training units (NPTU) in late 2017 after the selections are made.  Female 
JSIs or Sailors in initial training interested in volunteering for submarine 
duty should inform their chain of command.  In early 2017, Nuclear Propulsion 
Program Manager (OPNAV (N133)) will send a letter to each NPTU outlining the 
selection process. 8.  Specifics for the Enlisted Women in Submarines Rating 
Conversion Cycle 3 will be announced SEPCOR during the late summer of 2016.
