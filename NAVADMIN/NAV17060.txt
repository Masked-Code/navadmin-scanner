AMPN/REF A IS CNO LETTER, NAVY LEADER DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK.//

RMKS/1.  The Navy Leader Development Framework (NLDF) outlines how the U.S. 
Navy will develop leaders who demonstrate both operational excellence 
(competence) and strong character at every level of seniority.  This NAVADMIN 
provides direction for NLDF implementation in reference (a).

2.  Community leads, listed below, will create strategies and a continuum to 
develop leaders up to the Command Senior Enlisted Leader (CSEL) and major 
command levels for enlisted and officer leaders, respectively.   Each 
community lead will brief their leader development continuum to the Chief of 
Naval Operations (CNO) or Vice Chief of Naval Operations (VCNO) semiannually.

3.  The Naval War College (NWC), with the assistance of the Naval Leadership 
and Ethics Center (NLEC), will support community leads and develop and 
maintain a strategy for Navy-wide leader development beyond major command, 
with support from Flag Matters (N00F).  The Master Chief Petty Officer of the 
Navy (MCPON) will maintain a strategy for CSEL development, with support from 
NWC.  Inclusion and Diversity (I&D) principles, as outlined in the CNOs One 
Navy Team, will be incorporated into all leader development strategies.

4.  The Leader Development Continuum Council (LDCC) for the Navy, led by the 
President NWC, is an excellent forum to hold energized discussions on leader 
development.  The LDCC meets on a monthly basis and provides an opportunity 
for community leads to share best practices and provide feedback on proposed 
leader development strategies and programs.
