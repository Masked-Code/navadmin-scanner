SUBJ/ESTABLISHMENT OF YEOMAN (SUBMARINE), LOGISTICS SPECIALIST (SUBMARINE), 
CULINARY SPECIALIST (SUBMARINE) AND FIRE CONTROLMAN (AEGIS) SERVICE RATINGS//

REF/A/DOC/JUL16//
AMPN/REF A IS NAVPERS 18068F, MANUAL OF NAVY ENLSITED MANPOWER AND
PERSONNEL CLASSIFICATION AND OCCUPATIONAL STANDARDS, VOLUME I, NAVY
ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION (NECS).//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN establishes the Yeoman (Submarine) (YNS), Logistics 
Specialist (Submarine) (LSS), Culinary Specialist (Submarine) (CSS) and Fire 
Controlman (Aegis) (FCA) service ratings. These establishments are primarily 
administrative in nature and are expected to minimally impact the fleet.  In 
line with reference (a), YNS, LSS and CSS service ratings are warranted 
because specialized skills, as well as specific areas of qualifications, have 
been identified for personnel onboard submarines separate from their 
respective general ratings.  The FCA service rating is warranted because 
specialized skills, as well as specific areas of qualifications, have been 
identified for personnel that serve as FCA separate from the general Fire 
Controlman rating.  These establishments will permit optimum management and 
utilization of personnel, and economy of training.  Additional value will be 
gained for manpower, personnel, training and education because these new 
service ratings establish new rating control numbers that will augment 
current manpower programs, ultimately decreasing inventory inaccuracies.  
These new service ratings will only apply to active- duty (excluding Full-
Time Support) Sailors and billets.

2.  The establishment of the service ratings will be effective on the 
following schedule:
    a.  2 September 2017 for E6
    b.  17 October 2017 for E7-E9
    c.  28 November 2017 for E1-E5

3.  The primary personnel and billets to receive the new service rating will 
be as follows:
    a.  Yeoman, Logistics Specialists, and Culinary Specialists serving with 
a designator code of 1, 2, or 8.
    b.  Fire Controlman serving with the following NECs:  
1091, 1093, 1094, 1095, 1097, 1104, 1107, 1111, 1112, 1113,

4.  The establishment of these service ratings will not require a uniform or 
rating badge change.

5.  A Navy-Wide Advancement Examination will be created for each service 
rating which will improve the Navy advancement centers ability to identify 
and distinguish between the most knowledgeable candidates in the surface and 
submarine service ratings.  The new rating exam content and structure will be 
aligned with work-center tasks, equipment, tools, and technologies.  The 
first E4/5/6 exams will be March 2018 with the first E7 exam in January 2018.

6.  There will be no changes to the E7 and E8/9 evaluation and selection 
board processes.  Current policies exercised will continue unaltered.

7.  There will be no changes to sea/shore flow.  Current policies exercised 
will continue unaltered.

8.  This NAVADMIN does not implement any changes for Commander, Navy

unchanged.

9.  This NAVADMIN does not modify any previous guidance concerning early
