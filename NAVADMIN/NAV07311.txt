MPN/REF A IS DOD FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS, VOLUME 7A, CHAPTER 
29// 
RMKS/1.  THE FY-08 ANNUAL CLOTHING REPLACEMENT ALLOWANCE (CRA) FOR NAVY 
IS APPROVED FOR ACTIVE COMPONENT ENLISTED SAILORS E1 THROUGH E9.
THE INCREASE IN FY-08 AND FY-09 CLOTHING REPLACEMENT ALLOWANCE RATES IS 
PART OF NAVY’S PLAN TO FACILITATE THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW NAVY UNIFORMS 
DURING THE NEXT TWO YEARS.  TIMING OF THE CRA INCREASE ENSURES ELIGIBLE 
SAILORS HAVE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE OF THESE NEW UNIFORMS 
WHEN THEY ARE INTRODUCED TO THE FLEET.
2.  PER REF A, THE ANNUAL CRA PROVIDES ACTIVE COMPONENT ENLISTED 
SAILORS WHO HAVE GREATER THAN SIX MONTHS ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE WITH A 
MONETARY ALLOWANCE INTENDED FOR PURCHASING REPLACEMENT UNIFORM 
COMPONENTS.  THE AMOUNT OF ANNUAL CRA IS DETERMINED BY THE COST AND 
NUMBER OF UNIFORM COMPONENTS DIVIDED BY THE RESPECTIVE COMPONENT WEAR 
LIFE.  PER DOD GUIDANCE, ACTIVE COMPONENT SAILORS E1 - E6 WITH GREATER 
THAN SIX MONTHS, BUT LESS THAN THREE AND A HALF YEARS OF SERVICE, WILL 
RECEIVE SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE ALLOWANCE RECEIVED BY E1 - E6 SAILORS
WITH GREATER THAN THREE AND A HALF YEARS OF SERVICE.   
3.  DURING THE NEXT TWO YEARS, NAVY WILL INTRODUCE AND MAKE AVAILABLE 
FOR PURCHASE, COMPONENTS OF THE PHYSICAL TRAINING UNIFORM (PTU),
E1 - E6 SERVICE UNIFORM (SU) AND THE NAVY WORKING UNIFORM (NWU). 
APPROXIMATELY 300 DOLLARS OF THE FY-08 CRA IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE 
ADVANCE MONETARY COMPENSATION TO FACILITATE PURCHASING OF THE PTU SHIRT 
AND SHORTS (TWO EACH), ONE HALF OF THE SU UNIFORM REQUIREMENT AND ONE 
HALF OF THE NWU UNIFORM REQUIREMENT UPON AVAILABILITY.  THE
FY-09 CRA WILL PROVIDE FOR FINAL PURCHASING OF THE SU AND NWU 
REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO THE END OF THE TWO YEAR DISTRIBUTION PERIOD.
FOLLOWING FY-09, THE CRA RATES WILL REFLECT REPLACEMENT COST OF ALL 
UNIFORM COMPONENTS BASED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE WEAR-LIFE. 
4.  THE INTENT AND PROPER USE OF THE ANNUAL CRA IS EXPRESSLY FOR THE 
PURCHASE OF NEW AND REPLACEMENT UNIFORMS, WHICH ENABLES OUR ENLISTED 
FORCE TO PRESENT A UNIFORM PROFESSIONAL APPEARANCE.  LEADERS ARE 
STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO DISCUSS WITH THEIR SAILORS THE PROPER BUDGETING 
AND USE OF THIS REPLACEMENT ALLOWANCE.  SPECIFICALLY, SAILORS MUST BE 
AWARE THAT IT IS LIKELY THEY WILL RECEIVE THEIR ANNUAL CRA DISBURSEMENT 
SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE NEW UNIFORM AVAILABILITY, AND MUST THEREFORE 
BUDGET FOR ITS PROPER USE.  
5.  DUE TO THE DELAY IN THE FY-08 DOD APPROPRIATIONS BILL, SOME SAILORS 
RECEIVED THEIR CRA AT THE FY07 RATE WHILE WE OPERATED UNDER A 
CONTINUING RESOLUTION.  NOW THAT THE APPROPRIATIONS BILL PASSED, THEY 
WILL BE REIMBURSED BY AN ADDITIONAL DISBURSEMENT EQUAL TO THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FY07 AND FY08 RATES SHORTLY AFTER THE CALENDAR
YEAR BEGINS.   
6.  DETAILED GUIDANCE REGARDING SU AND NWU COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS AND 
AVAILABILITY WILL BE ISSUED VIA SEPCOR.
7.  POINT OF CONTACT IS MR. ROBERT B. CARROLL, OPNAV 131U, AT (703) 
614-5076/DSN 224 OR EMAIL AT ROBERT.B.CARROLL(AT)NAVY.MIL.
