RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the FY-19 Aviation Department Head Retention 
Bonus (ADHRB) and Aviation Command Retention Bonuses
(ACRB) for the Active Component (AC).

2.  A vital part of developing a total force strategy and maintaining combat 
readiness is to provide appropriate incentives to retain skilled personnel 
for critical naval aviation enterprise billets.  The AC Aviation Bonus (AvB) 
program, consisting of the ADHRB and ACRB, incentivizes highly talented, 
hard-working, career- minded naval aviators and naval flight officers 
choosing to remain on active duty.  Our return on investment is the retention 
for continued Navy service of our aviation warfighters, with their 
invaluable, irreplaceable skill sets and leadership.

3.  AC ADHRB:
    a.  Capable and dedicated department heads are vital to mission 
effectiveness, and represent the important link between senior leadership and 
junior personnel.  Retaining the experience and talent associated with those 
eligible to serve as aviation department heads greatly benefits the continued 
success of the naval aviation enterprise.
    b.  The AC ADHRB eligibility criterion includes selection for lieutenant 
commander (LCDR) and the FY-19 ADHRB is intended for officers selected for 
promotion to LCDR in the FY-19 LCDR promotion selection board.  These 
officers will be considered for department head in the FY-20 aviation 
department head screen board (ADHSB) scheduled to convene in April 2019.  
Additionally, eligible officers must have an active-duty service obligation 
(ADSO) associated with undergraduate flight training ending in FY-19 or 
later.  The application opportunity commences with the release of this 
NAVADMIN and closes on 31 August 2019.
    c.  Contracts are offered with either a three or five-year obligation 
that begins upon expiration of the winging ADSO or contract approval of the 
officer, whichever is later.  The intent is to provide flexibility when 
making career decisions and to encourage officers to fulfill a department 
head tour and continue naval service.
    d.  An officer who submits a five-year contract prior to the ADHSB 
results being published will receive the maximum annual rate specific to 
their type/model/series and designator (T/M/S+D).  If an officer prefers a 
three-year contract or wishes to wait until the ADHSB selection/slate results 
are public, the ADHRB annual amount reduces by $5,000 per year.
    e.  While all aviators that complete milestone assignments are equally 
valued, specific T/M/S+D rates vary according to respective community 
inventory health.  Those communities experiencing the greatest retention 
challenges are incentivized with the highest rates.  AC ADHRB retention bonus 
pay rates for FY-19 include:
five-year obligation, early rate:
HM Pilot                        $35,000/year ($175,000 total)

4.  AC ACRB:
    a.  As with the AC ADHRB, the AC ACRB is designed to retain those 
officers with the capabilities and command experience in our primary 
warfighting missions that are critical for the future of our service.  Our 
cadre of commander (CDR) commanding officers (CO) lead our naval aviation 
enterprise today, and they are the major commanders and flag officers of 
tomorrow.  Their skills and leadership experience are essential to the 
success of the Navy.  The
FY-19 ACRB incentivizes their continued service in follow-on assignments 
requiring senior aviation leaders.
    b.  ACRB applicants must have screened on the FY-19 aviation command 
screen board as CO of an eligible operational, operational training or 
special mission CDR command in order to apply.  Eligible commands are those 
for which the annual ACSB selects officers to serve as CO, excluding second-
in-grade/sequential/bonus/fleet
replacement squadron commands.  Consult the FY-19 ACRB program information 
for specific eligibility criteria and limitations.  The application 
opportunity commences with the release of this NAVADMIN and closes on 31 
August 2019.
    c.  All FY-19 ACRB contracts will be worth $100,000.  All eligible 
officers will receive an initial payment of $34,000 and two anniversary 
payments of $33,000.  Participation in the FY-19 ACRB obligates contractees 
to three years of obligated service to include full completion of a post 
command commander tour, which may be between 24 and 36 months depending on 
assignment.  ACRB obligation ends at the completion of 22 years of service, 
the projected rotation date of the assigned post command CDR tour or three 
years from contract acceptance date, whichever is later.  ACRB applications 
for those currently under ADHRB obligations will be accepted, held in 
abeyance and activated upon ADHRB contract expiration.

5.  Additional AvB Information:
    a.  Officers accepting AvB contracts are permitted to participate in the 
Career Intermission Program (CIP).  Officers interested in both AvB and CIP 
should contact the AvB program manager and their detailer for more 
information.
