ASSIGNMENT PAY.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the annual Special Duty Assignment Pay 
(SDAP) recertification process for fiscal year 2023.  In line with references 
(a) and (b), commanding officers (CO) are required to annually review and 
certify the entitlement to SDAP for each Sailor in their command.

2.  Recertification must be completed by 31 August 2023 and is a requirement 
for continued payment of SDAP to Sailors at each command beyond that date.

3.  A complete list of authorized skills and SDAP amounts can be obtained 
from the MyNavy HR website at:
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Enlisted-Career-Admin/SRB-SDAP-Enl-Bonus/.

4.  Process:
    a.  Obtain a summary of the authorized SDAP billets for the command using 
the My Navy Assignments database.  This is the filtered billet based 
distribution (BBD) report for the command that only lists the Sailors who are 
currently receiving SDAP.
        (1) This report may not be exhaustive.  Certifying commands must 
verify their entire complement of Sailors in order to validate SDAP payments 
to those who may not be electronically gained to the command or Sailors who 
are gained but are erroneously receiving SDAP.
        (2) Commands without an activity manning manager may request access 
to command career management system-interactive detailing using the procedure 
outlined in the following MyNavy HR web address:
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Portals/55/Career/Detailing/MyNavyAssi
gnment/MyNavy_Assignment_Access.pdf.  Certifying commands must have access to 
all subordinate unit identification codes (UIC).
        (3) Commands may contact BUPERS-328 via mill_sdap_recert.fct@navy.mil 
or (901)874-3260/DSN 882 for additional assistance in obtaining their SDAP 
BBD report.
    b.  Validate the entire command using the SDAP BBD report from the My 
Navy Assignments database as follows:
        (1) Next to each Sailor listed on the report, simply annotate the 
SDAP level and the associated Navy enlisted classification (NEC) for which 
SDAP is authorized in line with the most current SDAP eligibility chart.  Any 
erroneous SDAP payments must be corrected through the servicing TSC upon 
discovery.
        (2) In the event of an unposted activity loss or strength loss that 
resulted in a Sailor who has already transferred still being listed in the 
BBD report, simply line out or delete the line item.
        (3) Sailors who are not listed in the report due to a delayed or 
unposted activity gain should be added to the list and validated 
appropriately.
        (4) Once each Sailor at the command is validated, a signed letter 
from the CO or acting (not by direction) must be addressed and forwarded to 
Director, Military Community Management (BUPERS-3) with the SDAP BBD report 
as an enclosure.  The contents of the validation letter will include a 
statement from the CO certifying that a complete review of all authorized 
SDAP billets at the command was conducted and all discrepancies were 
rectified or are in the process of being resolved.  The letter will also 
contain the e-mail address and phone number of a suitable point of contact at 
the command and should also contain a list of all pending discrepancy 
resolution actions.
        (5) Send the command SDAP recertification letter and enclosed SDAP 
BBD report via encrypted e-mail to BUPERS-3 at:
mill_sdap_recert.fct@navy.mil.  The e-mail subject line must contain the UIC 
of the certifying command.
        (6) If a command has trouble sending the encrypted e-mail, ensure the 
encryption e-mail certificate is posted to the global address list.  If there 
are still encryption issues, contact BUPERS-
328 for additional options.
        (7) E-mail is the preferred method, but if needed to send the report 
via regular mail, please send to:
            Bureau of Naval Personnel
            Enlisted Incentive Program Department (BUPERS 328)
            5720 Integrity Drive
            Millington TN 38055-0130

5. Any action required to start, stop, or change the level of SDAP of a 
Sailor must be submitted to the supporting TSC via the Command Pay and 
Personnel Administrator.  All corrective transactions older than 240 days 
will be processed by BUPERS-328 via an e-mailed request submitted to 
mill_incen_pays.fct@navy.mil.

6.  Commands can check the status of their SDAP recertification at:
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Enlisted-Career-Admin/SRB-SDAP-Enl-Bonus/.  Please allow
5 to 10 days after submission for the webpage to be updated.

7.  Point of contact.  BUPERS-328, mill_sdap_recert.fct@navy.mil,
(901) 874-3260/DSN 882.

8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect through October 2023 unless 
superseded prior to that date.
