RMKS/1. THIS NAVADMIN RECOGNIZES APRIL 2012 AS CHILD ABUSE 
PREVENTION MONTH. ALL MEMBERS OF THE NAVY TEAM, MILITARY AND 
CIVILIAN, ARE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN CHILD ABUSE 
PREVENTION EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT 
CENTERS NAVY-WIDE WILL OFFER WORKSHOPS AND SEMINARS DESIGNED 
TO RAISE AWARENESS OF CHILD ABUSE.  

2. CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION MONTH IS A CONGRESSIONALLY SANCTIONED 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INITIATIVE. THE CAMPAIGN THEME FOR THIS 
YEAR IS "EVERY CHILD COUNTS." THIS THEME, ALONG WITH THE 
STRENGTHENING FAMILIES INITIATIVE - A CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION 
APPROACH PROMOTING FIVE PROTECTIVE FACTORS (PARENTAL RESILIENCY, 
SOCIAL CONNECTIONS, CONCRETE SUPPORT IN TIMES OF NEED, KNOWLEDGE 
OF PARENTING AND EARLY CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND EMOTIONAL 
COMPETENCE OF CHILDREN) ARE APPROACHES THAT ENSURE A CHILD'S 
SAFETY AND CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT SUPPORTS RESILIENCY IN 
MILITARY FAMILIES.  

3. CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT ADVERSELY AFFECT MISSION READINESS 
AND THE WELL-BEING OF OUR SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES. PROVIDING 
EDUCATION, SERVICES, AND STRATEGIES TO SAILORS AND FAMILIES ARE 
THE KEY TO PREVENTING CHILD ABUSE. SAILORS AND FAMILIES ARE 
INVITED TO ATTEND SEMINARS AND WORKSHOPS SPONSORED BY THEIR LOCAL 
FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTER'S (FFSC) DURING THE MONTH OF APRIL.
