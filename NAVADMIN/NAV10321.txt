SUBJ/INTERIM CHANGE TO NAVY OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM// 

REF/A/DOC/SECNAV/30MAY07// 
AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1750.1F - NAVY FAMILY OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM 
(AUTHORIZED CHILD CARE REIMBURSEMENT RATE), ENCLOSURE (6)// POC/GREG 
YOUNG/CIV/CNIC N91/LOC:WASHINGTON NAVY YARD, WASHINGTON DC 
/EMAIL:GREG.YOUNG(AT)NAVY.MIL/TEL:202-433-0519, DSN 288-0519// 

RMKS/1. THIS MESSAGE REVISES REF A. THIS CHANGE IS EFFECTIVE 
IMMEDIATELY.

2. OMBUDSMEN PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN OUR NAVY FAMILY READINESS. THEY 
ENSURE THAT FAMILIES HAVE THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO MEET THE 
CHALLENGES OF THE MILITARY LIFESTYLE, KEEP COMMANDING OFFICERS 
/COMMANDERS INFORMED OF THE WELFARE OF FAMILIES, AND ASSIST COMMANDS AND 
THEIR FAMILIES TO BE BETTER PREPARED TO MEET EMERGENCY SITUATIONS.

3. THE AVAILABILITY OF CHILD CARE IS A SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT SERVICE THAT 
PROVIDES OMBUDSMEN WITH A NECESSARY RESOURCE TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR 
MISSION. BASED ON RECOMMENDATIONS FROM REGION OMBUDSMEN ADVISORY BOARDS, 
WHEN NAVY OPERATED CHILD CARE IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE 
CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED BY REF A IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO MEET CHILD CARE 
MARKET RATES.

4. PARAGRAPH 2.A. OF REF A IS AMENDED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:
QUOTE
    2. REIMBURSABLE ITEMS. THE OMBUDSMAN MUST BE ACTING IN AN
    OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS DIRECTED BY THE COMMANDING OFFICER
    /COMMANDER TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR:
       A. CHILDCARE. OMBUDSMEN ARE ENCOURAGED TO UTILIZE NAVY
       OPERATED CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AT NO COST.  HOWEVER, WHEN NAVY
       OPERATED CARE IS UNAVAILABLE, REIMBURSEMENT FOR CHILD CARE
       /BABY SITTING WILL BE PAID WITH AVAILABLE COMMAND FUNDS.
END QUOTE

5. ACTION. COMMANDING OFFICERS/COMMANDERS SHOULD ENCOURAGE OMBUDSMEN TO 
UTILIZE NAVY OPERATED CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AT NO COST BY COMPLETING ON-
LINE REQUEST FOR CARE APPLICATIONS AT HTTP://CNIC.NAVY .MIL/CYP. WHEN 
NAVY OPERATED CARE IS NOT AVAILABLE, COMMANDING OFFICERS/COMMANDERS ARE 
AUTHORIZED TO REIMBURSE OMBUDSMEN FOR CHILD CARE/BABY SITTING WITH 
AVAILABLE COMMAND FUNDS. COMMANDING OFFICERS/ COMMANDERS ARE ENCOURAGED 
TO ESTABLISH REIMBURSEMENT CAPS BASED ON LOCAL MARKET RATES.

6. FOR ASSISTANCE WITH INFORMATION OF LOCAL COMMERCIAL MARKET RATES AND 
LOCATING COMMERCIAL CHILD CARE, COMMANDING OFFICERS/COMMANDERS AND 
OMBUDSMEN MAY CONTACT THEIR CLOSEST NAVY OPERATED CHILD CARE PROGRAM. A 
COMPLETE DIRECTORY OF ALL NAVY CHILD CARE PROGRAMS IS AVAILABLE AT 
CNIC.NAVY.MIL/CYP.

7. THIS CHANGE WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE NEXT PRINTED REVISION OF 
REF A.

8. RELEASED BY VICE ADMIRAL B. W. CLINGAN, DIRECTOR, NAVY STAFF, 
ACTING.//
