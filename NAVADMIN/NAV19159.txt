RMKS/1.  The Navy and the Submarine Force are pleased to announce 
applications for female Sailors in pay grades E1-E8 to convert to Submarine 
Force non-nuclear trained ratings are now being accepted on a continuous 
basis.  Applicants will be considered for conversion to fill open billets on 
previously integrated submarine crews and for initial enlisted integration of 
submarine crews as part of the integration plan of the Submarine Force.  
Integrated submarines include USS OHIO (SSGN 726) and USS MICHIGAN (SSGN 727) 
in Bangor, WA and USS FLORIDA (SSGN 728) and USS GEORGIA (SSGN 729) in Kings 
Bay, GA.

2.  Applications will be processed as they are received, and there is no 
specified due date.  Since available rating quotas will be filled as 
applications are processed, it is recommended that interested Sailors submit 
applications as soon as possible.
Applicants can expect to be notified by the Navy Personnel Command Enlisted 
Nuclear/Submarine Assignments Branch (PERS-403) and the Military Community 
Management, Enlisted Branch (BUPERS-32) of results within 2 months after 
submission.

3.  Sailors from all communities are eligible to apply for submarine service 
as part of this initiative.  Additional information regarding the selection 
process and application requirements is available via MyNavy Portal (MNP) at

Community Managers* link, then select the *Enlisted Women in
Submarines* link.
    a.  For E-6 and below Sailors, the following submarine career fields are 
open for conversion.  The non-nuclear ECM will best fit each Sailor to a 
rating based on their application package inputs and continued need for each 
rating.
        (1) Service Support career field includes Yeoman Submarines (YNS), 
Culinary Specialist Submarines (CSS) and Logistics Specialist Submarines 
(LSS).
        (2) Submarine Electronics career field includes Sonar Technician 
Submarines, Fire Control Technician, Electronics Technician-Navigation, 
Electronics Technician Communications and Information Systems Technician 
Submarines (ITS).
        (3) Mechanical career field includes Machinists Mate-Weapons and 
Machinists Mate-Auxiliary.
    b.  Applications for pay grades E-7 and E-8 will be accepted in the 
following ratings:  ITS (see note 1), LSS, CSS and YNS (see note

2).  Sailors interested in serving as the Independent Duty Corpsman
(IDC) should contact the Force IDCs listed below for additional information 
regarding volunteering for this program.
Note 1:  E-7 and E-8 Information Systems Technician conversions must have one 
or more of the following Navy enlisted classifications
(NEC):  742A, H08A or 746A (legacy NECs 2780, 2781 or 2791).
Note 2:  E-7 and E-8 Personnel Specialists are encouraged to apply.
Each application will be assessed to ensure the chief petty officer has the 
experience and expertise to manage and oversee all administrative and 
personnel actions to support the crew in the role of leading YNS aboard a 
submarine.

4.  All Sailors, regardless of rating or rank, must meet the following 
minimum criteria to be eligible for conversion:
    a.  Be a U.S. citizen already in possession of, or capable of receiving, 
a secret security clearance.
    b.  Meet Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) requirements 
for the desired rating(s) as outlined in reference (a).
    c.  Have no non-judicial punishments or convictions in civilian or 
military courts within the past 24 months.
    d.  Be medically screened and suitable for duty aboard a submarine in 
line with reference (b), Chapter 15.  Further information regarding this 
requirement is provided in subparagraph 5a(7).

5.  Applications:
    a.  The following is required for applications:
        (1) Enlisted Personnel Action Request (NAVPERS 1306/7) signed by the 
Sailor and endorsed by the Commanding Officer (CO) that clearly states the 
following:
            (a) Recommended earliest and latest release dates from the 
current command.
            (b) The submarine career field choices of the Sailor in order of 
preference.
            (c) Homeport preference for either Kings Bay, GA or Bangor, WA.
        (2) Last three performance evaluations.  Sailors with minimal service 
and less than three evaluations are still eligible and should submit all 
evaluations on record.
        (3) Physical readiness information maintenance system data covering 
the last 4 years of physical fitness assessment information, as available.
        (4) ASVAB scores (E-6 and below only).
        (5) Official statement volunteering for submarine service as outlined 
in reference (c).
        (6) CO recommendation letter (optional).
        (7) Completed submarine duty physical not required for processing of 
applications.  However, candidates must have a current submarine duty 
physical approved by an Undersea Medical Officer (UMO) within 30 days of 
application submission.  Due to the nature of submarine service, medical 
fitness for duty standards are stringent.  Therefore, interested candidates 
are encouraged to start this process as soon as possible following their 
decision to apply.
The Medical History Form (DD Form 2807-1) and Physical Examination Form (DD 
Form 2808) may be completed by any Department of Defense privileged provider.  
However, a UMO is required to review and approve the overall submarine duty 
physical on DD Form 2808.  UMOs are located at all submarine homeport medical 
departments.  Contact numbers and locations of submarine homeport medical 
departments and
UMOs:
           (a) Naval Submarine Support Center New London (Sub Base):

a submarine duty physical.

        (2) COMSUBPAC Force IDC (Pearl Harbor):  (808) 473- 1479/5788.
    b.  Sailors are encouraged to contact BUPERS-322 (See paragraph 9) to 
discuss ways to improve chances of selection and update their application.
    c.  Professional Apprentice Career Track (PACT) Sailors and junior rated 
Sailors are encouraged to apply, even with limited time in service, no 
warfare qualification or at-sea experience.  In line with reference (d), PACT 
Sailors selected for submarine service will be eligible for advancement to E-
4 upon successful completion of the training track for the selected rating 
and attainment of the required obligated service.

6.  Applications must be scanned and delivered to BUPERS-322.  If the social 
security number of the member is included in the application, an encrypted e-
mail is required for submission.  An example package is available via MNP at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning, select the *Enlisted 
Community Managers* link, then select the *Enlisted Women in Submarines* 
link.

7.  Prior to detailing selectees, PERS-403 will coordinate with commands to 
minimize the impact on the mission of the specific command as the Sailor 
transitions to submarine service.

8.  If a selectee is required to conduct a conversion from the reserve 
component to active component before eligible for orders, the selectee is 
required to coordinate directly with BUPERS-322 to allocate a Career 
Waypoints Reenlistment application quota for conversion.  Failing to do so 
will result in a delay in receiving orders and follow-on assignment.

contact BUPERS-322:

10.  The application process for E-6 and below nuclear-trained Sailors will 
be announced by the Nuclear Propulsion Programs Manager (OPNAV N133) and 
coordinated by the command career counselor of the individual Sailor at the 
Nuclear Power Training Units (NPTU).  OPNAV N133 will work with the NPTUs to 
establish application deadlines that maximize the opportunity for selection.  
Female junior staff instructors or Sailors in initial training at NPTU 
interested in volunteering for submarine duty should inform their chain of 
command as soon as possible in order to adequately manage their career 
timing.  Nuclear-trained Sailors may contact the Nuclear ECM Management Team 
points of contact:
