RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN advises of the upcoming Navy Marine Corps Intranet 
(NMCI) transition to derived credentials and new applications for mobile 
device access to email.  Transition is required as BlackBerry will sunset 
support for the Good for Enterprise (GfE) application on 28 February 2019.  
NMCI currently uses GfE and Smart Card Reader to deliver a secure mobile 
environment on iOS and Android devices.  The Navy must transition to a new 
mobile solution that provides required capabilities and security per 
reference (b).  The intent of this message is to provide expectations and 
highlight required user actions.  Commands are encouraged to migrate users as 
soon as possible and not delay transitions that could result in unintended 
user impacts.  Failure to migrate by the deadline will result in inability to 
send and receive email from the device.

2.  This approach will offer users the significant advantages of the Defense 
Information Systems Agency (DISA) preferred solution.  Retaining the same 
mobile device (tablet or smartphone), users will access their existing 
mailboxes and will be able to receive, edit, and send encrypted email without 
the use of a card reader (sled) or other hardware.

3.  PMW-205 selected BlackBerry Unified Endpoint Management (UEM), (which 
interfaces with BlackBerry Enterprise Mobility Suite, BlackBerry Work email 
application and DISAs Purebred Derived Credential) to replace GfE.  Purebred 
Derived Credential will provide an over-the-air certificate credentialing 
capability to enable the use of Department of Defense PKI credentials on 
mobile devices.  Upon migration to UEM, all NMCI mobile users shall leverage 
Purebred Derived Credential to enable:
    a.  Digitally signed email
    b.  Encrypted and decrypted email

4.  Full migration for iOS commenced 21 November 2018.  Each command must 
order the appropriate contract line item numbers and nominate a sufficient 
number of Purebred agents to enroll mobile devices and associate users with 
those devices.  Nominations and training are ongoing.  Command Chief 
Information Officers and contract technical representatives are responsible 
for tracking the transition for their commands.  Chief Information Officers 
and contract technical representatives must ensure that Purebred agents are 
identified and trained and users are prepared for the update.  GfE must be 
accessible.  The Android solution is undergoing testing.  Updates on the 
Android variant will be provided when available.

5.  Successful transition requires dedicated time, planning, and a location 
with wireless connectivity.  Users will keep their existing devices and must 
maintain them in an active state with the latest mobile operating system.  
Expect a minimum of 15 minutes each to download software and execute the 
credentialing process.  Experiences of early adopters has demonstrated that 
the entire evolution may take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours.  Other 
lessons learned are summarized below:
    a.  Instructions and standard operating procedure are posted on NMCI 
Homeport (link below).  Users must review and engage contract technical 
representatives if unsure of process before initiating migration.  Contract 
technical representatives are recommended to closely coordinate VIP 
transition.  Early lessons learned are that failure to accurately follow the 
procedures risks significantly delaying completion.
    b.  Users must be in a location with strong cellular or WiFi connectivity 
(minimum of two bars; recommend three) and ready access to an NMCI 
workstation.
    c.  During the Purebred credentialing process, the Purebred agent will 
provide an over the air PIN that the user must enter into the mobile device 
within three minutes of receipt.
    d.  During the last step of the credentialing process, users must 
generate their own over the air PIN by logging into an NMCI seat and using 
the DISA website.  Within three minutes of generation, users must enter the 
final over the air PIN into the mobile device.

6.  Command CIOs/CTRs shall report progress in implementation of the 
UEM/Purebred solution by weekly email reports to the PMW 205 Mobility Team at 
the below email address.  They should include assessments of challenges 
faced, noted lessons learned, and projection for successful completion.  PMW 
205 shall report progress to OPNAVN26G weekly beginning 15 January 2019.
