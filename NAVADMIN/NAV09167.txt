SUBJ/INCREASE TO MAXIMUM ALLOWED AWARD POINTS ON THE E4-E6 FINAL 
MULTIPLE SCORE WITH IN-THEATER SERVICE// 
REF/A/DOC/BUPERSINST 1430.16F/2NOV07// NARR/REF A IS BUPERSINST 
1430.16F, ADVANCEMENT MANUAL FOR ENLISTED PERSONNEL IN THE U.S. NAVY 
AND U.S. NAVY RESERVE// RMKS/1.  SINCE THE EARLIEST STAGES OF OPERATION 
IRAQI FREEDOM, THE PERFORMANCE AND ADVANCEMENT RESULTS OF SAILORS HAVE 
BEEN MONITORED TO ENSURE THAT IN-THEATER SERVICE DOES NOT DISADVANTAGE 
SAILORS.  WHERE WARRANTED BY THE DATA, POLICY ADJUSTMENTS HAVE BEEN 
IMPLEMENTED TO COUNTER IN-THEATER ADVANCEMENT CHALLENGES.  THIS 
NAVADMIN RAISES THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED AWARD POINTS IN THE FINAL MULTIPLE 
SCORE FOR SAILORS WITH IN-THEATER SERVICE.  THIS ACTION IS INTENDED TO 
PREVENT THE EXCLUSION OF IN-THEATER AWARD POINTS FOR THOSE SAILORS WHO 
CURRENTLY HAVE THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED AWARD POINTS FOR THEIR PAYGRADE.
2.  EFFECTIVE FOR THE AUGUST RESERVE CYCLE 085 AND SEPTEMBER ACTIVE 
DUTY CYCLE 204 ADVANCEMENT EXAMINATIONS, SAILORS WHO HAVE SERVED 
GREATER THAN 90 CONSECUTIVE DAYS IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, THE HORN OF 
AFRICA, KUWAIT, GUANTANAMO (GTMO), JOINT TASK FORCE 515 (USPACOM), OR 
THE JOINT FORCE SPECIAL TASK FORCE-PHILIPPINES (USPACOM), ARE 
AUTHORIZED A TWO POINT INCREASE TO MAXIMUM AWARD POINTS AUTHORIZED IN 
REF A.  THIS INCREASES THE MAXIMUM AWARD POINTS TO 12 AWARD POINTS FOR 
E4 AND E5 CANDIDATES AND 14 POINTS FOR E6 CANDIDATES.  
3.  THE INCREASE OF THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED AWARD POINTS FOR CANDIDATES 
ELIGIBLE FOR TWO IN-THEATER AWARD POINTS IS NOT RETROACTIVE TO PREVIOUS 
ADVANCEMENT CYCLES.  REF A PROVIDES THE CRITERIA FOR AWARDING IN-
THEATER SERVICE AWARD POINTS.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH TABLE
3-1 OF REF A, IN-THEATER SERVICE AFTER 24 OCTOBER 2001 QUALIFIES A 
SAILOR FOR THE INCREASE IN THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED AWARD POINTS FOR RESERVE 
CYCLE 085 AND ACTIVE DUTY CYCLE 204 ON. 
4.  MONITORING ADVANCEMENT RESULTS OF IN-THEATER SAILORS WILL CONTINUE.  
WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS FOR IN-THEATER 
SAILORS.
