NARR/REF (A) IS NAVADMIN 002/12, RECRUITING INCENTIVES FOR SELECTED RESERVE 
OFFICERS.  REF (B) IS RESPERS M-1001.5 NAVY RESERVE PERSONNEL MANUAL.  REF 
(C) IS ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR HEALTH AFFAIRS (ASD (HA))

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces recruiting incentives for Selected Reserve 
(SELRES) officers.  This message supersedes ref (a), provides the current 
listing of eligible specialties for SELRES officer recruiting incentive 
programs effective immediately, and remains in effect until superseded.  This 
message also updates ref (b).  Applicants who received a 
quota/precertification (PRECERT) prior to this message and have not been 
commissioned and affiliated as of the release of this message are subject to 
the requirements of this message.  Applicants whose designator and/or 
subspecialty are no longer listed or no longer eligible for the incentive for 
which a quota/PRECERT was previously issued are no longer eligible, and any 
previous quota/PRECERT is rescinded.


2.  To ensure operational effectiveness today and into the future, our Navy 
must attract the highest quality officers possible.  A vigorous recruiting 
plan, governed by ref (c), requires flexible tools to ensure we are 
recruiting the correct number of officers with the right skills to optimize 
our warfighting capability. 

3.  The following paragraphs identify each of the Selected Reserve Officer 
Bonus/Incentive Programs and provide lists of eligible designators, 
subspecialties (SSPs), and paygrades for each program.  
Throughout this message, the term "Selected Reserve" indicates a member 
drilling in an inactive duty training (IDT) pay status in the Navy Reserve.  
The effective date for all incentives described herein is the affiliation 
date in the Selected Reserve.

submitting documents. 
    d.  Issuance of a quota/PRECERT does not imply an incentive guarantee.  A

requirements, funds are available to pay the incentive.
    e.  If a subsequent NAVADMIN updates eligible specialties or payment 
amounts after issuance of a quota/PRECERT and prior to the member's 
commissioning and affiliation, the member's quota/PRECERT must be reissued 
following the requirements of the new message.

specialties listed in para 6 that do not appear on the FY-14 through

through 9 and any outstanding quotas/PRECERTS will be cancelled.

13.  Point of contact for policy is Mr. James Johnson, CNRFC N1C21, at
(757) 322-2244/DSN 262 or via e-mail at james.p.johnson(at)navy.mil.
