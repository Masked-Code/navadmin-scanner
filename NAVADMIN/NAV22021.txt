FOR NUCLEAR TRAINED ENLISTED PERSONNEL.   
REF B IS NAVADMIN 157/19, SEA SHORE FLOW ENLISTED CAREER PATHS UPDATE FOR 
NUCLEAR TRAINED JUNIOR STAFF INSTRUCTORS.// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN updates and replaces the sea shore flow (SSF) career 
path in reference (a).  The SSF career path for junior staff instructors 
(JSI) outlined in reference (b) remains in effect. 
 
2.  The Nuclear Propulsion Program Manager (OPNAV N133) identified a downward 
trend in reenlistment behavior in selective reenlistment bonus (SRB) Zone B 
(six to ten years of service) in the nuclear enlisted community.  The nuclear 
aggregate reenlisted inventory in SRB Zone B is at 76 percent of the overall 
zone goal as of October 2021.  Submarine and surface reenlisted inventories 
in SRB Zone B are at 84 percent and 63 percent, respectively, of their zone 
goals. 
Some modifications to the current SSF career path outlined in reference (a) 
are required to ensure continued success for Sailors that comprise the Naval 
Nuclear Propulsion Program enterprise.  
These changes improve alignment between the nuclear SSF career path and the 
eligibility requirements for reenlisting with SRB in Zone B. The changes 
outlined below in paragraph 3 provide the following advantages for Sailors 
who reenlist in SRB Zone B: 
    a.  Provides the obligated service (OBLISERV) necessary for a Sailors 
first shore tour and does not commit the Sailor to a second sea tour. 
    b.  Allows Sailors to earn a Zone B bonus to OBLISERV for their 
shore tour. 
    c.  Provides the ability for applicable Sailors to transfer GI Bill 
benefits to their dependents without committing to a second sea tour. 
    d.  Provides the opportunity to earn a college degree while on shore duty 
by either using the GI Bill or tuition assistance. 
    e.  Provides the opportunity to earn higher-level qualifications 
(e.g., engineering watch supervisor or propulsion plant watch supervisor) and 
serve in senior leadership positions on a Sailors first sea tour. 
    f.  Provides better at-sea watch bill flexibility due to increased at-sea 
manning. 
 
3.  The modifications to the SSF contained in reference (a) are as follows 
    a.  Extends the first sea tour from 48 months to 54 months. 
    b.  Adjusts the two career milestone gates to 10.5 years and 17.5 years 
for the second sea tour and third sea tour, respectively. 
    c.  Maintains all follow-on sea tours after the first sea tour at 40 
months for all paygrades. 
    d.  Maintains shore tour lengths as prescribed in reference (a). 
 
4.  The modified SSF is displayed in paragraph 5.  The initial training 
pipeline for all Sailors is set to a nominal length of 24 months.  Sea tours 
are annotated below as SEA and shore duty is annotated as SHR.  All numbers 
in paragraph 5 are in months. 
 
5.  The SSF is modified as follows for a Sailor who does not serve as a JSI 
    SEA1 SHR1 SEA2 SHR2 SEA3 SHR3 SEA4 SHR4 
     54   36   40   36   40   36   40   36 
NOTE 1:  Navy Personnel Command, Enlisted Submarine/Nuclear Power assignments 
(PERS-403) will issue shore tour orders up to 40 months for billets that 
require additional training or qualification. 
 
6.  The career milestone gates will be utilized as follows 
    a.  PERS-403 will not delay a Sailors return to sea to align them with 
these gates. 
    b.  If a Sailor is behind the nominal SSF career path and approaching a 
gate, PERS-403 will adjust the Sailors future tour lengths when issuing 
orders to align their planned rotation date with the gate or obtain a waiver 
from OPNAV N133 to exceed the gate. 
A Sailors shore tour length would normally not need to be reduced if the 
nominal SSF was being executed. 
    c.  PERS-403 will maintain shore tour lengths of at least 24 months (plus 
any required training or qualification period) unless a waiver is received. 
    d.  Sailors who are unable to meet a gate will be handled on a  
case-by-case basis and will require a waiver submitted by PERS-403 and 
approved by OPNAV N133. 
 
7.  These policy changes will require close coordination between the command, 
each nuclear-trained enlisted Sailor and PERS-403 to facilitate a smooth 
transition to the new SSF.  Therefore, implementation of these changes will 
be phased as follows: 
    a.  Effective immediately, all new first sea tour orders issued by  
PERS-403 will comply with the tour lengths shown in paragraph 5. 
    b.  The 10.5-year and 17.5 year gate discussed in paragraph 3 are 
effective immediately.  Waivers are required to exceed these gates, as 
discussed in paragraph 6. 
    c.  To allow Sailors and their families time to plan for potential future 
duty station changes, projected rotation date (PRD) changes should be made 
using the following guidance.  The *effective date* referenced below is 1 
April 2022 to coincide with the April/May 2022 MyNavy Assignment cycle. 
        (1) For Sailors on their first sea tour: 
            (a) Sailors within 12 months of their previously established PRD 
at the time of the effective date will not have their PRD shifted unless the 
Sailor routes an enlisted personnel action request (NAVPERS 1306/7) that is 
endorsed by the command specifically requesting the PRD change. 
            (b) Sailors who have a PRD greater than 12 months, but less than 
or equal to 14 months from the effective date, will have their PRD shifted to 
align to a 50-month sea tour, unless otherwise requested by the command. 
            (c) Sailors who have a PRD greater than 14 months, but less than 
or equal to 16 months from the effective date, will have their PRD shifted to 
align to a 52-month sea tour, unless otherwise requested by the command. 
            (d) Sailors who are greater than 16 months from their PRD from 
the effective date will have their PRD shifted to align with the new SSF. 
    d.  Within three months of the date of this NAVADMIN, all commands shall 
submit a PRD planning letter or message to PERS-403 using the guidance of 
paragraph 7c.  PERS-403 will coordinate with OPNAV N133 to adjudicate waivers 
to the career milestone gates based on the information received. 
 
8.  A downloadable graphic that displays the modified SSF is available on the 
OPNAV N133 website at the following address:

Management/Enlisted/Nuclear/CCC-Toolbox/.   
Commands are encouraged to download this product and post it for Sailors to
