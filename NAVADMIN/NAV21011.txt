Submission of Letters to Promotion and Selection Boards through MyNavy 
Portal, announced the introduction of a new application known as Electronic 
Submission of Selection Board Documents (ESSBD), accessible through MyNavy

over other LTB submission methods, such as hard copy and e-mail submitted 
letters and related attachments.

boards.
    b.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to electronically 
submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without attachments and 
will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) exactly what will 
be delivered and presented to the board.
    c.  To utilize ESSBD, candidates must access document services through 
MyNavy Portal at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record.
On-screen instructions will direct the submitter thereafter.
    d.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted.  If required, a full visual user 
guide is available through MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion.
    e.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command not later than 2359 
(central standard time) (CST) 10 calendar days prior to the convening date of 
the respective board, as noted below.
Submitters are cautioned to not wait until the deadline date to submit LTBs 
via ESSBD or other available avenues.

concerning the record of the officer that the officer considers important.

individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not originated by 
the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of the eligible 
officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must contain a written 
acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she desires such 
correspondence be presented to the board.
Correspondence without such an acknowledgement is considered third party 
correspondence and will be returned without being presented to the board.  
Classified correspondence will not be accepted.

Center by calling 1 (833) 330-MNCC (1 (833) 330-6622/DSN 882).
