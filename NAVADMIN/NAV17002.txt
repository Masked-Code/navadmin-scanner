RMKS/1.  As directed in reference (a), this NAVADMIN establishes the Chief of 
Chaplains as program sponsor for the professional development of Chaplain 
Corps (CHC) officers and Religious Program Specialists (RP).  The Chief of 
Chaplains conducts annual short-course training for CHC officers and RP to 
update essential techniques and practices in military ministry.  This 
training enables chaplains to obtain continuing education units which may be 
required to maintain their credentials with their religious organizations.

2.  The FY-17 Professional Development Training will consist of two separate 
components for a total of four days.  The Professional Development Training 
Workshop (PDTW), conducted the first day, focuses on Professional Naval 
Chaplaincy pursuant to reference (b).  It is open to all chaplains and 
religious program specialists. The PDTW will enhance the capability of 
chaplains and religious program specialists to meet professional standards 
and develop leadership skills.

3.  The following three days of the Professional Development Training Course 
(PDTC) will address The Role of Chaplaincy in the Face of Violence.  Naval 
service personnel and their families face a broad spectrum of threats to 
include targeted and interpersonal violence.  Chaplains and RP must be 
prepared to respond appropriately to these threats and provide healing and 
recovery to individuals, families, and units.  The PDTC will enable chaplains 
and RP to provide effective religious ministry to those involved in 
circumstances of violence and to provide relevant advice to commanders as 
required by references (a) and (c).

4.  The FY-17 PDTW and PTDC are offered at the following CONUS and OCONUS 
locations:

5.  The PDTC was developed in line with references (d) and (e). Both the 
Under Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the Navy, as directed in 
references (f) and (g), have called for training that better equips chaplains 
and RP in the areas of interpersonal/domestic violence.

6.  Subject to local approval, commands are authorized to provide 
appropriated funds in support of religious ministries within the command to 
include funding chaplains and RP to attend annual PDTCs as directed in 
references (h) through (j).  Chaplains and RP can register for the FY-17 
Professional Development Training through the Enterprise Navy Training 
Reservation System.  More information about the process can be found on 
MilBook.  Registration is on a space available basis.  Chaplains and RP must 
register separately for the PDTW (CIN:  A-5G-0005, CDP:  06ZZ) and the PDTC 
(CIN:  P-5G-1303, CDP:  07A2).  Participants are encouraged to attend the 
training in their local area.
