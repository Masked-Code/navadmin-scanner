RMKS/1.  The Secretary of Defense Awards Program annually recognizes the 
Department of Defense's most outstanding field-level military maintenance 
units from a very competitive field of candidates.  I would like to extend my 
congratulations and gratitude for all Navy units that submitted nomination 
packages.  Each nominee should be proud of their accomplishments.

2.  The field-level awards are given to two outstanding field-level 
maintenance units in each of three categories (small, medium, large) across 
the Department of Defense.  I am pleased to announce the following 2013 
Secretary of Defense Field-level Maintenance Award winners:
Large Category - USS JOHN C. STENNIS (CVN-74)
Medium Category - USS EMORY LAND (AS-39)
Small Category - NAVSEA Submarine Performance Monitoring Team 
This represents half of the awards given to DoD units for field-level 
maintenance. 

3.  Due to the current fiscal uncertainty, OSD is still determining the best 
method to formally present these awards and announce the winner of the 
Phoenix Award.  The Phoenix Award goes to the very best maintenance unit from 
the six field-level awards winners.  It represents the very best of all the 
field-level winners and is the highest award for field-level maintenance.

4.  Congratulations and job well done!  These units can be justifiably proud 
of their accomplishments to maintain Navy's ability to operate forward.  They 
represent the best of military maintenance.
