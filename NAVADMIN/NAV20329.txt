RMKS/1.  Per reference (a), the Culture of Excellence Oversight Committee 
(COE OC) has been reviewing, simplifying and aligning policies and programs 
that are duplicative or ineffective.  This NAVADMIN provides a status report 
on this process and implements specific policy changes as a result of this 
work.  In September 2019, the COE Governance Board approved the COE OCs 
recommendations regarding the 197 resilience related policies, programs, 
practices and processes (P^4s), with only 28 to continue as-is.  Those 
recommendations that require policy changes and guidance are identified 
below, are effective immediately and will remain in effect until the guiding 
instructions and references, where applicable, are
updated:
    a.  General Military Training (GMT).  The recent release of reference (b) 
has limited mandatory GMT to the following and will be reflected in 
subsequent annual GMT NAVADMINs:
        (1) Annual:
            (a) SAPR
            (b) Cyber Awareness Challenge
            (c) Counterintelligence Awareness and Reporting
            (d) Records Management
            (e) Suicide Prevention
        (2) Biennial:

required within the first year of service.
Additional training remains an optional GMT subject to Commanding Officers 
discretion.
         (2) Consolidated Training:
                (a) Per reference (c), Active Shooter Training may be 
consolidated into existing AT Level 1 training.
       (b) Discretionary GMT Hazing Policy and Prevention training has been 
combined with Equal Opportunity, Harassment and Resolution Options.
        (3) The One Love Escalation Workshop is under review.  U.S.
Pacific Fleet commands have master trainers available in most locations to 
support discretionary training.  See reference (d) for details.
        (4) Discontinued Trainings:
                (a) Pure Praxis
                (b) Per reference (e), OSC pre-deployment training and OSC

    c.  Collateral Duties:

assigned for the duration of the fundraising campaign that may include pre-

coordinators and key personnel should be assigned only for the duration of 
the Secretary of the Navy ADFD.
        (4) Per reference (i), the Command Sponsor Program Coordinator and 
Command Indoctrination (INDOC) Program Coordinator collateral are a combined 
collateral duty.
        (5) Command Fitness Leader (CFL) Seminars were reduced 25% from 12 
per year to eight per year, adding regional Fitness Coordinators to teach as 
well.
        (6)  Command Training Teams have been disestablished by reference (j) 
and are no longer required.
        (7) Per reference (k), unit SAPR Point of Contacts (POCs) are no 
longer required.  SAPR POC duties and responsibilities shall be included in 
the SAPR Victim Advocate (VA) responsibilities.  Commands will appoint one 
unit SAPR VA as the primary unit SAPR VA responsible for ensuring the SAPR 
POC responsibilities outlined in reference (k) are met.  Commands will have 
180 days from the date of this message to transfer POC duties to the 
appointed Unit VA.
        (8) In alignment with best practices and, at the discretion of 
Commanders, Echelon II and III SAPR Officers may expand their duties and 
responsibilities to include other COE initiatives.
    d.  Programs, practices and processes:
        (1) CRTs will manage the conduct of Human Factors Councils (CRTHFC), 
which will assess risk factors at the individual Sailor level.  References 
(j), (l), and (m) provide additional guidance.
        (2) The Force Preservation Council (FPC) pilot lessons learned will 
be integrated into CRT guidance.  The FPC will stand down and be managed as 
CRTHFCs in accordance with references (j) and (l).
        (3) The Strategic Workforce Action Group was disestablished by 
reference (n).  It was replaced by the Inclusion and Diversity Practitioners 
Sync and convenes under the COE Working Group in accordance with reference 
(o).
        (4) The Strategic Workforce Council was replaced in reference
(o) by the Inclusion and Diversity Council (IDC), comprised of senior Navy 
leaders and key workforce stakeholders chaired by the Vice Chief of Naval 
Operations.  The IDC convenes semi-annually opposite the Chief of Naval 
Operations COE Governance Board in accordance with reference (n).
        (5) Per reference (p), disenrollment from FEP no longer requires a 
Sailor to remain in FEP until the next official Physical Fitness Assessment 
(PFA).
        (6) Body Composition Assessment (BCA) spot checks, introduced in 
reference (q), remain a highly encouraged best practice.
        (7) Barracks Roving Patrols implemented as a SAPR preventive measure 
in references (k) and (r) are discontinued as a SAPR program; however, they 
may be integrated into the base security programs if required by the base 
commander.
        (8) SAPR *first flag reports* mandated in reference (k) are no longer 
required.  Other *first flag officer* responsibilities detailed in reference 
(k) remain in effect.  Immediate Superiors in Command (ISICs) may require 
additional reporting or information if needed.  Other *first flag officer* 
responsibilities detailed in reference (k) remain in effect.
        (9) Behavioral Health Quick Polls are no longer a program of record 
and were replaced by the Status of Forces Survey and stress- related 
questions in the Defense Organizational Climate Survey.
        (10) Per reference (s), OSC Governance Board has been disestablished.
        (11) Several competing substance abuse campaigns (e.g. *That Guy*, 
*Keep What You Earned*, *The Domino Strategy How to Drink Responsibly*, *Who 
Will Stand Your Watch?*, *Keep What You Earned* and *Prescription for 
Discharge*) have been cancelled and/or consolidated.
        (12) Reference (t), Hand-Held ADD Program, remains a commanding 
officers discretionary program.  Reference (t) will be cancelled when 
incorporated into OPNAVINST 5350.4E to ensure commands that use ADDs have 
sufficient guidance.
        (13) Urinalysis testing.  As a best practice and to reduce excessive 
administrative burden, smaller commands (approximately 80 authorized billets 
or less) are encouraged to join a larger commands urinalysis testing program.  
A memorandum of understanding or memorandum of agreement shall be signed by 
the two commanding officers in order to specify the responsibilities of each 
command.
For further guidance, commands should contact their Type Commander/ISIC or 
Echelon II Alcohol and Drug Control Officer (ADCO).
