NARR/REF A IS THE ENLISTED INFORMATION DOMINANCE WARFARE SPECIALIST

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES AMPLIFYING GUIDANCE TO REFS A AND B.  
EFFECTIVE 01 MARCH 2011, COMMANDS WITH INFORMATION DOMINANCE CORPS (IDC) 
SENIOR ENLISTED PERSONNEL FROM EACH IDC RATE (E6 OR ABOVE FROM THE AG, CT, IS, 
IT RATES) ARE AUTHORIZED TO IMPLEMENT THE EIDWS PROGRAM FOR SAILORS IN IDC 
RATINGS.  NON-IDC SAILORS SUPPORTING THE IDC MISSION AND ABLE TO MEET PROGRAM 
REQUIREMENTS ARE ALSO PERMITTED TO PARTICIPATE.

2.  COMMANDS WITHOUT ALL OF THE IDC ENLISTED SKILL SETS OUTLINED IN PARA 1 MAY 
COORDINATE PARTICIPATION WITH COMMANDS HAVING APPROVED EIDWS PROGRAMS.  
COMMANDER, NAVY CYBER FORCES (NAVCYBERFOR) IS THE APPROVING AUTHORITY FOR 
CROSS-COMMAND EIDWS QUALIFICATIONS.

3.  WHERE APPLICABLE, IDC SAILORS SHALL FIRST COMPLETE THE PRIMARY WARFARE 
PROGRAM FOR THE PLATFORM TO WHICH THEY ARE ASSIGNED PRIOR TO COMPLETING EIDWS 
QUALIFICATION (E.G. AIR WARFARE AT AVIATION SQUADRONS, SURFACE WARFARE ABOARD 
SHIPS).  EIDWS QUALIFICATION TIMELINES SHOULD BE FOLLOWED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
REF A.

4.  EIDWS PROGRAM COORDINATORS AND MANAGERS SHALL ENSURE THEIR COMMAND'S 
PROGRAM INCLUDES PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES TO ALLOW FOR THE QUALIFICATION OF 
ASSIGNED SELECTED RESERVES IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE OPNAV AND NAVCYBERFOR 
INSTRUCTIONS.  PER REF A, SELECTED RESERVE PERSONNEL HAVE FORTY-EIGHT MONTHS 
FROM THE DATE OF ENROLLMENT TO COMPLETE AN INITIAL EIDWS QUALIFICATION.

5.  COMMANDS WITH APPROVED EIDWS PROGRAMS SHALL SUBMIT QUARTERLY PROGRAM 
OVERSIGHT REPORTS TO NAVCYBERFOR THAT INCLUDE QUALIFICATION PROGRESS TO 
JUSTIFY THE COMMAND'S PROJECTED ELIGIBILITY TO FLY THE EIDWS PENNANT.

6.  THE FOLLOWING IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AN APPROVED PROGRAM:
A.  COMPLETE THE EIDWS PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT CHECKLIST PER REF A.
B.  SUBMIT CHECKLIST WITH SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION TO NAVCYBERFOR FORCE MASTER 
CHIEF FOR APPROVAL.

7.  NAVCYBERFOR SHALL ENFORCE RIGOR THROUGH A PERIODIC REVIEW OF APPROVED 
EIDWS PROGRAMS.  IN OCTOBER 2011, NAVCYBERFOR SHALL REVIEW EIDWS PROGRAM 
STATUS TO DOCUMENT THE NUMBER OF EIDWS WARFARE QUALIFICATIONS, AND TO 
DETERMINE IF EIDWS PROGRAM EXPANSION IS REQUIRED.

8.  IDC SAILORS DEPLOYED AS INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEES HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO 
SEE AND PARTICIPATE IN THE FULL RANGE OF INFORMATION DOMINANCE WARFARE 
SPECIALTIES IN A COMBAT ENVIRONMENT.  IF THE SUPPORTED COMMANDER FEELS THE 
PROGRAM WILL ENHANCE NAVY SUPPORT TO JOINT OPERATIONS, NAVY SUPPORT ELEMENTS 
FOR JOINT COMMANDS FORWARD (E.G. AFGANISTAN, IRAQ, HOA) MAY REQUEST TO 
ESTABLISH EIDWS PROGRAMS THROUGH NAVCYBERFOR.
