SUBJ/OBSERVANCE OF NATIONAL AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE
/HERITAGE MONTH 2005//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THE NAVY OF THE 21ST CENTURY IS MADE UP OF
PERSONNEL WHO INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO MISSION
SUCCESS.  IT IS EACH INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR UNIQUE CAPABILITY AND
TALENT WHICH CONTRIBUTE GREATLY TO THE READINESS OF OUR FORCE.  THE
MONTH OF NOVEMBER IS NATIONAL AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE
HERITAGE MONTH AND IS A PERFECT TIME TO HIGHLIGHT THE DIVERSITY OF
OUR FORCE.  OVER THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS, WARS, AND CONFLICTS,
AMERICAN INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVE PERSONNEL HAVE PERFORMED SUPERBLY
IN THEIR ADMIRABLE SERVICE TO OUR GREAT NAVY.

WARS FROM THE REVOLUTION TO OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM.  DURING WORLD
WAR I, NEARLY 12,000 AMERICAN INDIANS/ALASKA NATIVES SERVED AS
VOLUNTEERS.  DURING WORLD WAR II, 44,000 AMERICAN INDIANS/ALASKA
NATIVES SERVED WITH DISTINCTION IN BOTH THE PACIFIC AND EUROPEAN
THEATERS.  IN THE VIETNAM WAR, 42,500 AMERICAN INDIANS/ALASKA
NATIVES SERVED IN THE ARMED FORCES.  DURING OPERATION DESERT
STORM 24,000 SERVED.  TODAY, 10,649 AMERICAN INDIANS/ALASKA NATIVES
PROUDLY SERVE ON ACTIVE DUTY (USN AND USNR) IN THE UNITED STATES
NAVY.  AMERICAN INDIANS/ALASKA NATIVES HAVE THE HIGHEST PER CAPITA
RECORD OF SERVICE WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS.
3.  AMERICAN INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVES HAVE LONG BEEN AN INTEGRAL
PART OF OUR AMERICAN CHARACTER.  TRIBAL TRADITIONS HAVE BROUGHT
VALUES AND IDEAS THAT HAVE BECOME INGRAINED IN OUR AMERICAN SPIRIT.

APPRECIATION OF AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE HERITAGE AND THE
DIVERSITY WE ALL BRING TO THIS GREAT NATION.
