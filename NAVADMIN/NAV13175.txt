RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN shall be read in its entirety to ensure all 
stakeholders in the ship inactivation process are aware of the 
projected inactivation schedule for the upcoming fiscal year, their 
respective responsibilities, and any necessary follow-up actions.  For 
the purposes of this NAVADMIN, the inactivation date in paragraph 2 
reflects the start of the planned inactivation availability for a 
nuclear ship or the official retirement date for non-nuclear ships.

2.  The projected FY14 ship inactivation schedule for inactivating 
U.S. naval ships is promulgated as follows to facilitate fleet 
planning efforts to conduct an inactivation availability:
Ship Name                         Inactivation   Post Decom Status
USS FORD (FFG 54)                 31 Oct 2013     See Note 1
USS THACH (FFG 43)                15 Nov 2013     See Note 1

Note 1:  Designated for foreign military sale (cold).  It is Navy 
policy that ships designated for FMS transfer shall not be stripped.  
Stripping of ships provides diminished operational capability to 
maritime partners and corrodes our efforts to build maritime partner 
capacity.  TYCOMS are required to ensure strict adherence to this 
direction.  NAVSEA PMS 326 will issue additional guidance via SEPCOR 
to Fleet TYCOMS identifying non-transferrable technology.  Except in 
the case of C3/C4 emergent CASREPS, no removals of installed equipment 
(e.g., Combat, C4I, HME SYSTEMS, etc.) will be permitted except as 
specifically authorized by OPNAV N9I in response to a record request 
submitted by PEO IWS or respective NAVSEA ship program office no later 
than 90 days prior to the ships official retirement date that 
includes:  a comprehensive list (by ship) of specific installed 
equipment desired for removal; justification for the removal that 
includes evidence that the Navy supply system, TYCOM/RMC is unable to 
fulfill the requirement; an assessment of the requestor's ability to 
restore the equipment in operational condition in the event the vessel 
transfers as a cold FMS ship; and coordination via the respective 
Systems Command.  All other equipment/supply removals are to be 
conducted per ref (a).     

Note 2:  Dismantlement (scrap).  MSC shall submit a naval message per 
ref (b) NLT 90 days prior to the ships' inactivation to CNO WASHINGTON 
DC //00/09/N4/N42/N9/N9I//, COPY COMNAVSEASYSCOM WASHINGTON DC//SEA 
05/21/, INACTSHIPOFF PORTSMOUTH VA//00/01// and supporting activities 
advising of the planned retirement, disposition, and funding ISO the 
ships' inactivation.  MSC shall coordinate directly with NAVSEA 21I 
regarding lay-up requirements and custody transfer to either NAVSEA or 
MARAD.  MSC shall adhere to refs (b) and (c) status reporting 
requirements.  

Note 3:  Utilize as a logistic support asset primarily ISO remaining 
ships in its class.

Note 4:  Date inactivation begins in a naval shipyard and the unit is 
no longer available for operational tasking.  Official status of the 
vessel will be in-commission/in-reserve (ICIR) pending final 
decommissioning.  Final decom date shall be reported to the CNO and 
NVR Custodian per refs (b) and (c).

Note 5:  Retain in a retention status under NAVSEA custody ISO future 
mobilization requirements. 

3.  Per refs (b) and (d), COMPACFLT and COMUSFLTFORCOM shall 
coordinate with their respective Type Commanders and submit an 
organizational change request (OCR) with enough lead time for OPNAV to 
staff and approve the final decommissioning/inactivation of a naval 
vessel.  

4.  Per ref (b), all ship Commanding Officers/Masters or Ship 
Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC) shall send a separate naval 
message announcing that the actual retirement date has occurred.  It 
shall be addressed to CNO WASHINGTON DC//00/09/N1/N2/N6/N4/N3/N5/ 
support activities, COMNAVSEASYSCOM WASHINGTON DC//SEA 05C/SEA 21// 
and NAVHISTHERITAGECOM N8/N9/N9I//.  Info addees shall include the 
chain of command, all appropriate WASHINGTON DC.  Message should give 
a brief history of the life of the ship to include significant events.

5.  Adjustments to a ship's official inactivation date that crosses 
the current fiscal year must be coordinated with OPNAV N9I per ref (b) 
due to the reporting requirement that Navy must inform Congress on 
execution year force structure changes that differ from what Congress 
authorized/appropriated and signed into law by the President.  OPNAV 
shall promulgate changes to the inactivation year as required.
