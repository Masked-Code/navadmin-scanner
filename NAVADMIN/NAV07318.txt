FIRST TERM.  ADDITIONALLY, THERE REMAINS SIGNIFICANT APPRENTICE LEVEL 
WORK IN THE FLEET WHICH MUST NOW BE ACCOMPLISHED BY RATED SAILORS 
EXPECTING MORE CHALLENGING ASSIGNMENTS TO BUILD ON THEIR INITIAL ?A?
SCHOOL TRAINING.  TO BETTER UTILIZE THE SKILLS OF OUR TRAINED JUNIOR 
SAILORS AND PROVIDE AN APPRENTICESHIP TO RATING CAREER PATH OPTION, THE 
PACT PROGRAM BEGAN OCTOBER 2007.

INITIAL APPRENTICESHIP COURSE FOR THEIR TRACK AND RECEIVE FOLLOW-ON 
ASSIGNMENT TO A FLEET UNIT INTO A VACANT APPRENTICE LEVEL BILLET.  
USING THE FLEET RATING IDENTIFICATION ENGINE (FLEET RIDE) AT 
HTTPS://FLEETRIDE.SSCNO.NMCI.NAVY.MIL, A RATING ELIGIBILITY SCREENING 
AND CAREER PROGRESSION PLAN WILL BE DEVELOPED DURING THE REPORTING 
CAREER DEVELOPMENT BOARD (CDB).  CDBS SHALL BE CONDUCTED AND DOCUMENTED 
IN THE CAREER INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (CIMS) PER REF B.
