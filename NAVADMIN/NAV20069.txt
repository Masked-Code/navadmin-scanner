RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supplements examination administration guidance in 
references (a), (b) and (c) to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 throughout the 
Navy in accordance with reference (d) and (e).  All enlisted advancement 
exams after 17 March 2020, active and reserve component makeup/late exams are 
rescheduled with the following administration dates:
    a.  21 May 2020  Cycle 247 (E-4 only) Active Duty and Full-Time Support 
(FTS) regular Navy-wide Advancement Examinations (NWAEs).
    b.  22 May 2020  Cycle 106 (E-4 through E-7) Selective Reserve

weekend after this date.
    c.  12 June 2020  Cycle 247 (E-4 through E-6) final date to administer 
substitute exams.

2.  Policy.  The examination reschedule dates result in no change to the 
advancement candidates final multiple score and eligibility requirements as 
promulgated in references (a), (b) and (c).  Commands are authorized to 
administer regular exams and must safeguard exams currently held until 
examination administration dates.  Substitute examination administration must 
be kept to a minimum.  Educational Services Officers (ESOs) should forward 
exams in accordance with reference (a) when Sailors transfer prior to the 
rescheduled administration dates.  As the COVID-19 situation becomes clearer, 
we will continue to reevaluate the timeline for each exam.

3.  Results.  E-4 through E-6 Total Force advancements and SELRES
E-7 Selection Board Eligibility are anticipated to be released in July 2020.  
Results are heavily dependent on commands promptly processing and returning 
answer sheets.

4.  Enlisted Advancement Worksheet (EAW).  A system change will be made to 
the Cycle 247 (March 2020) E-4 Enlisted Advancement Worksheets, setting the 
new examination administration date to 21 May 2020.  ESOs will have until 
that date to finalize E-4 Worksheets.  For Cycle 106, it is the ESOs 
responsibility to ensure examination dates are changed for the approved late 
substitute examination administrations.
