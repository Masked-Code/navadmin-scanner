SUBJ/ENLISTED ADVANCEMENT OVERVIEW// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT PAST 
AND FUTURE ENLISTED ADVANCEMENT SYSTEM CHANGES.  THESE IMPROVEMENTS 
RECOGNIZE SUPERIOR PERFORMERS, SUPPORT OUR SAILORS IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON 
TERRORISM (GWOT) AND ESTABLISH THE CRITICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN 
EDUCATION, PERFORMANCE AND ADVANCEMENT. 
2.  OVERVIEW OF SEPTEMBER 2007 MODIFICATIONS.  FOUR MODIFICATIONS 
EFFECTIVE WITH THE SEPTEMBER 2007 EXAM CYCLE REMAIN IN EFFECT. 
    A.  ADMINISTERING ADVANCEMENT EXAMS IN COUNTRY.  NAVADMIN 139/07 
PROVIDES OPERATIONAL COMMANDERS ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY TO ADMINISTER 
ADVANCEMENT EXAMS ON A UNIT BASIS IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN AND THE HORN OF 
AFRICA, IF CONDITIONS PERMIT.  FLEXIBILITY STILL EXISTS FOR EARLY, LATE 
AND MISSED EXAMS.  
    B.  WAIVING OF E7 EXAMS FOR THOSE IN COUNTRY WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY 
SELECTION BOARD ELIGIBLE.  NAVADMIN 139/07 ALSO WAIVES THE EXAM FOR 
THOSE E6 SAILORS WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY SELECTION BOARD ELIGIBLE AND WILL 
BE IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, AND THE HORN OF AFRICA DURING THE EXAM CYCLE. 
    C.  REDUCTION IN TIME REQUIRED IN COUNTRY FOR INDIVIDUAL 
AUGMENTATION (IA) AWARD POINTS.  NAVADMIN 141/07 AWARDS TWO POINTS TO 
THE ADVANCEMENT AWARDS FACTOR FOR SAILORS WHO HAVE COMPLETED GREATER 
THAN 90 DAYS IN AN IA TOUR, PCS TOUR, TEMADD, OR IN ANY DUTY STATUS IN 
IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, HORN OF AFRICA, KUWAIT, GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA, JOINT 
TASK FORCE 515 (USPACOM), AND JOINT SPECIAL OPERATIONS TASK FORCE-
PHILIPPINES (USPACOM).
    D.  ADJUSTMENT TO THE E4-E6 FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE (FMS). 
NAVADMIN 183/07 INCREASED THE WEIGHT OF EVALUATIONS AND EXAMS IN THE
E4-E6 FMS TO PROVIDE A BETTER ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR SUPERIOR DECK 
PLATE PERFORMERS AND THOSE WHO DEMONSTRATE A HIGH LEVEL OF TECHNICAL 
AND PROFESSIONAL MILITARY KNOWLEDGE.
3.  FUTURE MODIFICATIONS.  THREE NEW MODIFICATIONS WERE RECENTLY 
APPROVED.  SPECIFIC DETAILS WILL FOLLOW IN FUTURE MESSAGES.
    A.  EDUCATION POINTS.  A FUTURE NAVADMIN WILL DETAIL THE 
INCORPORATION OF TWO POINTS FOR AN ACCREDITED ASSOCIATE DEGREE AND FOUR 
POINTS FOR AN ACCREDITED BACCALAUREATE OR HIGHER DEGREE IN THE
E4-E6 FMS, EFFECTIVE WITHIN THE ACTIVE/FTS CYCLE 196 (SEPTEMBER
2008) AND RESERVE CYCLE 083 (AUGUST 2008) ADVANCEMENT EXAMINATIONS. 
IN ADDITION, CONTINUED EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON EDUCATION IN E7-E9 
SELECTION BOARD PRECEPTS.  WHILE THE E7 FMS DOES NOT INCLUDE EDUCATION 
POINTS, BOARD PRECEPTS FOR E7-E9 WILL EMPHASIZE FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION 
OF ACCREDITED DEGREES.  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EDUCATION POINTS, 
TOGETHER WITH THE EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION IN PRECEPT LANGUAGE, REFLECT 
THE IMPORTANCE OF CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS REQUIRED FOR A MORE 
EFFICIENT, MORE TECHNICALLY CAPABLE FUTURE FORCE. 
    B.  ADJUSTMENT TO THE E7 FMS.  A FUTURE NAVADMIN WILL ANNOUNCE 
CHANGES TO THE E7 FMS THAT INCREASES THE EVALUATION WEIGHT AND ALTERS 
THE PERFORMANCE MARK AVERAGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROMOTABLE, MUST 
PROMOTE, AND EARLY PROMOTE ADVANCEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS IN SAILOR 
EVALUATIONS.  THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE E7 FMS BECOMES EFFECTIVE WITH THE 
ACTIVE/FTS EXAM CYCLE 198 (JANUARY 2008) AND RESERVE EXAM CYCLE 082 
(FEBRUARY 2008) ADVANCEMENT EXAMINATIONS.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS 
ADJUSTMENT IS SIMILAR TO THE CHANGES MADE TO THE E4-E6 FMS (NAVADMIN 
183/07), IN THAT IT PROVIDES INCREASED OPPORTUNITY FOR SUSTAINED 
SUPERIOR PERFORMERS TO BECOME SELECTION BOARD ELIGIBLE, WHILE 
MAINTAINING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE WITH AVERAGE EVALUATIONS WHO 
DEMONSTRATE A HIGH LEVEL OF TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL MILITARY 
KNOWLEDGE.
    C.  SEAL/SWCC E7 FMS PILOT.  A FUTURE NAVSPECWARCOM GENADMIN WILL 
DISCUSS THE DETAILS OF A NAVAL SPECIAL WARFARE (NSW) COMMUNITY PILOT 
PROGRAM WHICH APPLIES A MULTIPLE VARIABLE ALTERNATIVE FMS TO DETERMINE 
E7 ACTIVE-DUTY SELECTION BOARD ELIGIBILITY IN THE SPECIAL WARFARE 
OPERATOR (SO) AND SPECIAL BOAT OPERATORS (SB) RATINGS, EFFECTIVE WITH 
THE ACTIVE CYCLE 198 (JANUARY 2008) ADVANCEMENT EXAMINATION.  THIS 
THREE-YEAR PILOT ADDS FIVE PERFORMANCE FACTORS TO THE EXAM STANDARD 
SCORE AND PERFORMANCE MARK AVERAGE ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE E7 FMS:  
MEASURES OF LEADERSHIP, DEPLOYMENTS, QUALIFICATIONS, AWARDS, AND ETHOS 
(INDICATION OF BEHAVIORAL ISSUES, SUCH AS NON-JUDICIAL PUNISHMENT, 
DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE AND PHYSICAL FITNESS ASSESSMENT FAILURES).  
FOR THIS PILOT ONLY, ALL TIME-IN-RATE (TIR) ELIGIBILE OR EARLY PROMOTE 
TIR WAIVED SAILORS WHO HAVE A RECOMMENDATION FOR ADVANCEMENT AND PASS 
THE E7 ADVANCEMENT EXAM, OR ARE WAIVED FROM THE EXAM IAW NAVADMIN 
139/07, WILL BE SELECTION BOARD ELIGIBLE.  THIS PILOT PROGRAM WILL 
ALLOW US TO DETERMINE IF A COMMUNITY SPECIFIC FMS WILL BENEFIT THE 
ENTIRE FLEET.
4.  EVERY MODIFICATION TO THE ENLISTED ADVANCEMENT SYSTEM IS CAREFULLY 
RESEARCHED TO ENSURE WE RETAIN AND ADVANCE THE RIGHT MIX OF SKILLED AND 
MOTIVATED SAILORS WHO WILL LEAD OUR NAVY.  THESE CHANGES BENEFIT OUR 
SAILORS AND EMPHASIZE QUALITIES CONSISTENT WITH THE NAVY VISION OF 21ST 
CENTURY LEADERS.
