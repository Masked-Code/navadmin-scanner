AMPN/REF A IS CHIEF OF NAVAL PERSONNEL MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 
REGARDING TRAINING FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT INITIAL DISPOSITION AUTHORITY.// 

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the FY-14 schedule for the senior 
officer course.  The Naval Justice School has presented the senior 
officer course at worldwide locations since 1955.  Participants 
regularly give the course outstanding marks for increasing awareness 
of current legal issues and promoting efficiency in handling legal 
matters.  Per ref (a), the senior officer course is now required for 
all Navy captains (Paygrade O6) en route to O6 commands.

2.  Course registrations will no longer be accepted via e-mail, phone 
or fax.  All quota requests should be made via the Enterprise Naval 
Training Reservation System (ENTRS).  A web guide and user manual are 
available on the site.  Commands are responsible for system 
familiarization.  For ENTRS questions and system guidance call 
commercial (850) 452-1001/DSN 922 option 1.  Access to ENTRS may be 
obtained by logging onto 
https://main.prod.cetars.training.navy.mil/cetars/main.cac_message. 
(lower case).  Select "request access" from the initial login screen 
and fill out the application.  Applicants should accurately enter data 
to avoid disapproval of requests.

3.  Commanding officers, executive officers, and officers in charge 
are encouraged to attend at their earliest opportunity.  Officers O4 
and above who have a mission essential need for this training may be 
assigned on a space available basis.  Officers for whom the class is 
mandatory have priority for quotas.  Officers having completed similar 
training in the past are encouraged to attend as a refresher.  Travel 
and per diem costs will be the responsibility of individual commands.  
The course curriculum is based on familiarization with the uniform 
code of military justice, administrative fact-finding bodies, 
administrative separation procedures, the court-martial process, and 
various other policies relating to command administration of legal 
matters.  This course is not a substitute for the legal officer course 
(S-5F-0014).

School, Newport, RI.  To register, log onto
