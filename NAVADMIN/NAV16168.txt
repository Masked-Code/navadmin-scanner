RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides updated guidance to SECRET Internet Protocol 
Router Network (SIPRNet) Department of Defense (DoD) Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) Cryptographic Log-on (CLO) enforcement deadlines 
promulgated in references (a) and (b).  This NAVADMIN applies to all Navy 
owned, operated, and controlled SECRET networks, web servers, web sites, and 
portals.

2.  Immediate action.  General end user and privileged accounts must
meet the following requirements:
    a. Tactical and Non-Tactical:
        (1) Fleet Cyber Command/Commander TENTH Fleet (FCC/C10F)
        shall enforce PKI CLO on all SECRET Navy and Marine Corps
        Intranet(NMCI) and OCONUS Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-Net) accounts
        by 31 July 2016.  This includes all end user, Windows system
        administrator, and developer accounts with the exception of
        accounts that have no technical solution.  Exceptions are limited to
        network devices, service accounts, Windows limitations (joining
        devices to the network), and functional/group accounts (currently
        limited by DoD PKI infrastructure until 31 October 2016) or accounts
        that have Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare
        (OPNAV N2N6) approved waivers.
        (2) Owners and Program Owners of all other SECRET tactical
        and Non-Tactical networks including networks connected to the
        Secret Defense Research Engineering Network (SDREN) will enforce PKI
        CLO by 31 July 2016.  This includes all end user, Windows system
        administrator, and developer accounts with the exception of
        accounts that have no technical solution.  Exceptions are limited to
        network devices, service accounts, Windows limitations (joining
        devices to the network), and functional/group accounts (currently
        limited by DoD PKI infrastructure until 31 October 2016) or accounts
        that have OPNAV N2N6 approved waivers.  All stand-alone networks not
        PKI CLO compliant must also submit a waiver request.
        (3) PKI CLO enforcement on SECRET Research, Development,
        Testing, and Evaluation standalone networks is held in
        Abeyance pending guidance from DoD Chief Information Office (CIO) and
        Joint Staff.
        (4) Afloat SECRET Networks:  Commands with Integrated
        Shipboard Network System/Common Personal Computer Operating
        System Environment (ISNS/COMPOSE) will enforce PKI CLO upon
        installation of Navy Certificate Validation Infrastructure (NCVI)
        with the exception of functional/group accounts (currently limited by 
        DoD PKI infrastructure until 31 October 2016).  Platforms with
        Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) upgrades
        must enforce PKI CLO as the upgrades include a Validation
        Authority (Validation Server/PKI server) that enables PKI CLO upon
        installation with the exception of functional/group accounts
        (currently limited by DoD PKI infrastructure until 31 October
        2016).
        (5) Owners of all SECRET tactical websites and portals will
        enforce PKI authentication (National Security Service (NSS)
        token based) no later than 31 August 2016.
        (6) Accounts not in compliance by applicable deadlines will
        be disabled.
