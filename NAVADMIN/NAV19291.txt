RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides updated guidance that supports correct and 
consistent implementation of references (a) through (e) which directed Navy 
personnel and Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) 
network, web, and application owners to transition to the Personal Identity 
Verification Authentication (PIV_Auth) certificate for all authentication 
functions.

2.  Action for All Navy Personnel:
    a.  In accordance with references (d) and (e), beginning in February 
2018, new Navy issued Common Access Cards (CAC) had the PIV_Auth certificate 
activated and visible.  No further action is required.
    b.  All ashore Navy personnel to include contractors, Foreign Liaisons 
/Officers and REL - A NIPRNet users who have not received a new CAC since 24 
February 2018 and/or cannot see their PIV_Auth certificate, are overdue and 
must follow the procedures located on the Navy Marine Corps Internet 
Homeport, (https://www.homeport.navy.mil/support/articles/activate-piv_auth-
cert), and Information Security Online Services, (https://infosec.navy.mil 
/PKI/) to activate the PIV_Auth certificate via the Defense Manpower Data 
Center (DMDC) Real-Time Automated Personal Identification Systems (RAPIDS) 
Self-Service website, (https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/self_service).
    c.  All afloat users on Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise 
Services (CANES) who have not received a new CAC since 24 February 2018 
and/or cannot see their PIV_Auth certificate, must activate it no later than 
31 January 2020.

3.  Actions for all Navy owners of PK-enabled networks, websites, and 
applications requiring CAC for authentication (this ONLY applies to the CAC):
    a.  All Navy owners of NIPRNet networks, websites, and applications must 
ensure their systems are capable of supporting the PIV_Auth certificate for 
authentication functions no later than 29 February 2020.  No waivers will be 
considered or granted for this transition.
    b.  CAC Reconfiguration:  For CACs issued starting 1 May 2020, reference 
(c) outlines the CAC modernization changes and mandates that all CACs be 
configured with the Department of Defense (DoD) Public Key Infrastructure 
(PKI) certificate profile:
        (1)  PIV_Auth Certificate:  Per references (a) and (b), the PIV_Auth 
certificate will be the only technically capable PKI certificate on the CAC 
to support network, web, or application authentication.  The PIV_Auth 
certificate will be the only certificate capable of NIPRNet authentication.
        (2)  Identity Certificate:  This PKI certificate will no longer be 
included on the CAC.
        (3)  Email Signing Certificate:  This PKI certificate will no longer 
be technically capable of supporting network, web, or application 
authentication.  The Extended Key Usage (EKU) is being removed and will no 
longer support authentication capabilities.  This PKI certificate will be 
used for the intended purpose of signing emails and documents.  Additionally, 
this certificate will be renamed the Signature certificate beginning 1 May 
2020.
        (4)  Email Encryption Certificate:  No change to this PKI 
certificate.
    c.  Legacy CAC Attrition and Certificate Usage:  Reference (c) mandates 
that DoD component NIPRNet network, web, and application owners configure CAC 
user accounts to support the PIV_Auth certificate.  DoD recognizes that CACs 
issued with the legacy configuration (CACs issued prior to 1 May 2020) and 
any PKI certificates capable of supporting authentication functions are still 
considered valid DoD PKI certificates.  These legacy PKI certificates can 
still be used for authentication if the NIPRNet network, web, or application 
owner allows.  The legacy configuration of authentication capable 
certificates
include:
        (1)  PIV_Auth Certificate.
        (2)  Identity Certificate.
        (3)  Email Signing Certificate:  Includes the EKU.
        (4)  Legacy CAC configurations will be removed from DoD and Navy
        environments via attrition as legacy CACs expire.

4.  NIPRNet Alternate Logon Token (ALT) or NIPRNet Enterprise Alternate Token 
System (NEATS) Use-Case Impacts.
    a.  NIPRNet ALT or NEATS Token users are not impacted, as the PIV_Auth 
certificate implementation is only applicable to the CAC.
    b.  The PIV_Auth certificate is defined in reference (b) as a mandatory 
certificate to be included on federally issued PIV cards, to include the DoD 
CAC.  Certificates issued on other DoD-approved form factors (i.e., ALT or 
NEATS tokens) cannot have PIV_Auth certificates.
    c.  ALT and NEATS tokens have certificates which are approved for use in 
authentication.  These non-CAC authentication certificates may continue to be 
used in accordance with DoD policy, but are not referred to as PIV_Auth 
certificates.
    d.  Role-based user accounts (i.e., System Administrators, Foreign 
Nationals, Code Signers, and other NIPRNet use-cases) can continue 
utilization of their tokens and certificates without loss of access.  Navy 
NIPRNet network, web, and application owners must ensure their systems 
support the ALT and/or NEATS token users.

5.  Impacts to DoD approved External Certificate Authorities (ECA).  ECAs may 
continue to be used for authentication to unclassified DoD websites and 
applications; however, ECAs are not and have not been approved for 
cryptographic logon/authentication to DoD networks.

6.  For additional detail regarding CAC PKI certificate mapping options for 
PIV _Auth and/or legacy CAC certificate options, a Frequently Asked Questions 
document is available at https://intelshare.intelink.gov/sites/disa-pki-pke/
_layouts/15/start.aspx#/SitePages/Home.aspx.  Owners or technical teams can 
contact PMW 130 and NIWC PKI if technical assistance is required:
    a.  PMW 130:  Mr. Cody Persinger, cody.persinger.ctr(AT)navy.mil
    b.  NIWC Atlantic:  Ms. Noni Jenkins, noni.jenkins(AT)navy.mil
    c.  NIWC Pacific:  Mr. Gary Delgado, gary.delgado(AT)navy.mil

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until canceled or superseded.
