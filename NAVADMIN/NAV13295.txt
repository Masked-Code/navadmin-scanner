APPROVAL PROCESS (ITAAP).//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN updates ref (a)guidance for the Information Technology 
Procurement Request (ITPR) and approval process, effective 1 October 2013.

2.  ITAAP ensures effective and efficient expenditure of funding to acquire 
IT capabilities, prevent duplicative investments, provide visibility on all 
Navy IT related expenditures, and ultimately achieve strategic sourcing for 
IT procurement. Procurement actions for IT may not be initiated without an 
ITPR approval.

3.  The following IT procurement guidance applies to all IT assets including 
hardware, software, maintenance, contract support, and telecommunication 
services that are reported in the Program Budget Information System-IT (PBIS-
IT) and resourced with Navy appropriated and non-appropriated funds.

    a. The ITPR threshold for fiscal year (FY) 2014 remains at $500K.  The 
ITAAP governance body will review all ITPRs of $500K or greater and forward 
to the Deputy Department of the Navy Chief Information Officer Navy (DDCIO 
(N)) for approval.  For ITPRs less than $500K, the Echelon II Command 
Information Officer (Ech II CIO) retains discretion to set a local approval 
threshold amount for assigned Echelon III and below commands. 
      
    b. Procurement requests must be submitted electronically via 
Navy Information Dominance Approval System (NAV IDAS) for:

            record software, hardware, maintenance, and support 
            services;

        (3) Cryptologic (UNCLASSIFIED) IT systems;

        (4) IT procured using military intelligence program funds;

        (5) IT for industrial/base operating support (i.e., heating,

        (6) Ashore excepted network infrastructure assets and 
            services;

        (7) Commercial off the shelf and Government modified off the

        (9) Business IT that supports oversight and program 
            management operations of Program Executive Office, 
            Program Manager Warfare, or Program Manager Air; and 
            Weapon Systems support (i.e., portals, hardware, and 
            software tools, engineering services, financial 
            management, installation, and customer support);

        (10) Research, Development, Test and Evaluation laboratory

(DoD) programs using non-Navy budget dollars to procure IT hardware, 
software, maintenance, support, or telecommunications in support of other DoD 
components or non-DoD agency programs may submit an ITPR for tracking 
purposes.  Expenditures for such requests will not be reported in the IT 
expenditure reporting summary.
