NARR/Reference (a) is Chief of Naval Operations Implementation Instruction 
for reference (b).  Reference (b) is Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) 
Instruction prescribing policy and publishing guidance governing Department 
of the Navy support to the Defense Attach Service (DAS).  Reference (c) is 
Navy Personnel Commands Military Personnel Manual (MILPERSMAN) article 
providing information on officer candidate application and selection 
criteria.  Reference (d) is MILPERSMAN article providing information on 
enlisted candidate application and selection criteria.  Reference (e) is 
SECNAV message promoting Navy’s participation in the DAS.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN promotes service within the Defense Attach Service 
(DAS) for Navy personnel, refer to reference (a) for more information.

2.  With our constantly evolving global environment, the U.S. Navy looks to 
its most qualified and capable officers and enlisted personnel to fulfill the 
demanding and rewarding positions of naval attaches and enlisted support 
billets.  In October 2013, the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) issued 
reference (b).  This instruction emphasizes the critical importance of the 
DAS program; includes a more robust screening and selection process with all 
positions now requiring multiple candidates; and for naval attach positions, 
the SECNAV continues to serve as the final approval authority for the 
nomination to the Defense Intelligence Agency .

3.  Interested candidates are required to first contact their community 
detailer to discuss the Navy Attach Program and how it supports their career.  
Once this discussion has taken place, and the prospective candidate has 
received tour-release, the candidate should call the Attach Placement Officer 
(PERS-474B for attach and Operations coordinator (OPSCO) availability) or 
Enlisted Shore Special Assignments (PERS-4010 for operations assistant 
(OPSASST) availability).

4.  Critically important, demanding and exciting opportunities at Defense 
Attach Offices (DAO) in embassies worldwide are available to those who meet 
the selection criteria of references (c) and (d).
    a.  Over the next year, among other billets, Navy Attach Affairs will 
screen for attach positions in China, Denmark, Germany, Nigeria, and Sweden.
    b.  In addition, exceptional Limited Duty Officer/Chief Warrant Officer 
and enlisted personnel will be able to screen for OPSCO and OPSASST positions 
in China, Japan, Germany, Italy, and Malaysia.

5.  To demonstrate the importance SECNAV places on duty at DAO as discussed 
in reference (e), procedures are now in place at Navy Personnel Command (NPC) 
to expand the eligibility for DAS assignments and increase awareness of 
opportunities.  NPC will recognize DAS service through statutory promotion 
board precepts.  Additionally, these tours frequently offer language 
training, foreign language proficiency pay, and special duty assignment pay 
for enlisted personnel.

6.  A comprehensive current list of attach, OPSCO, and OPSASST opportunities 
are available at the following NPC webpages:

7.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.

for Information Dominance, OPNAV N2N6.//
