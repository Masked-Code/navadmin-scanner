RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the annual Special Duty Assignment Pay 
(SDAP) recertification process for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 and clarifies 
retroactive payments and procedures.  In line with references (a) and (b), 
commanding officers (CO) are required to annually review and certify each 
entitlement to SDAP of the Sailor.
This certification is to verify every Sailor who is assigned to an eligible 
billet remains qualified to fill the billet and is receiving the correct 
SDAP.  Certification shall commence upon the release of this NAVADMIN and 
continue through 31 August 2018.  In line with reference (a), commands that 
do not complete the required certification by 31 August 2018 will have the 
SDAP of their Sailors terminated retroactive to 1 June 2018.  Back pay will 
not be approved for commands that do not submit their recertification by the 
deadline.

2.  To verify if a Sailor is eligible and receiving the correct level of 
SDAP, a complete list of authorized skills and pay amounts can be found at:  
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/Pages/SRB.aspx.

3.  Follow these procedures to certify the SDAP report for your command:
    a.  Obtain and print the annual SDAP report of your command.
The annual SDAP report only pulls those Sailors that are currently drawing 
SDAP.
        (1) The command annual SDAP report may be obtained by sending a 
digitally signed email to the SDAP Recertification Report help desk at 
mill_sdap_recert(at)navy.mil.
        (2) Annual SDAP report requesters are to include their primary unit 
identification code (UIC) in the subject line and any required subordinate 
UICs in the e-mail body.
        (3) Requests can only be submitted by Command Career Management 
System-Interactive Detailing (CMS-ID) users with the activity manning manager 
(AMM) role.  Requester must have CMS-ID AMM access for all subordinate UICs 
requested.  Commands with no AMM will need to submit a CMS-ID AMM access 
request as outlined on the Navy Personnel Command (NPC) web site
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/enlisted/cmsid/Pages/default2.aspx.
        (4) The SDAP report will be returned as an attachment either in an 
encrypted email or via the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research 
Development and Engineer Center (AMRDEC) Safe access file exchange process.  
AMRDEC Safe will send an email form *No-Reply(at)amrdec.army.mil* with 
specific instructions on how to access and download the file.
    b.  Verify your command as a whole and make changes as follows:
        (1) Add all Sailors who are eligible for SDAP, but not listed in the 
annual SDAP report.  To add, simply handwrite or type the name, rate, 
effective date, and level on the bottom of the Annual SDAP report.  If there 
is not enough space, attach a list on command letterhead.
        (2) Draw a line through any Sailor who is no longer eligible and put 
a brief description as to why they are no longer eligible 
(transfer/separation/loss of Navy Enlisted Classifications).
        (3) Verify levels are in line with the most recent SDAP eligibility 
chart on the NPC web site http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/Pages/SRB.aspx, and draw a line through listed 
level and replace with new level as required.
        (4) The original signature of the CO must be on each page of the 
annual SDAP report accompanied by the following statement:
*After review, I certify that all required additions and changes have been 
annotated, actions required to start, stop, increase or decrease has been 
processed via Personnel Support Detachment prior to submission of 
recertification and all Sailors at this command are receiving the correct 
SDAP entitlement.*  This statement can be handwritten, typed, or put on with 
a label.  A cover letter is not required, and only recommended if the command 
needs more space for Sailors added.
        (5) Provide a point of contact in the top right hand corner of the 
first page of the annual SDAP report.
        (6) Send the SDAP report via encrypted e-mail to 
MILL_INCEN_PAYS(at)navy.mil.  If you are having trouble sending encrypted e-
mail, contact the Enlisted Incentive Program Department (BUPERS-328) at 
901-874-3260/DSN 882 so that you can be added to the contact list.  E-mail 
subject line should read:  Encryption request for UIC, POC:  name and phone 
number and/or e-mail address.  E-mail is the preferred method, but if you 
need to send via regular mail, please send to:
    Navy Personnel Command
    ATTN:  Enlisted Incentive Program Department (BUPERS-328)
    5720 Integrity Drive
    Millington, TN 38055-0130.
        (7) E-mail subject line must contain:  UIC, POC:  rate, name, and 
phone number.
        (8) SDAP recertifications do not go to the Personnel Support 
Detachment (PSD), only the required changes need to be submitted to PSD via 
the transaction online processing system.

4.  Each command is responsible for ensuring updates are made to the Sailors 
record through the commands servicing PSD.  No changes will be made by NPC as 
part of the annual recertification process.  If changes are required by the 
BUPERS-328, then send via separate correspondence with Sailors name in 
subject line of the e-mail.

5.  Commands can check the status of their SDAP recertification at
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/Pages/SRB.aspx.  Commands are strongly 
encouraged to use this site to ensure all subordinate commands have completed 
the recertification.  Please allow five to ten days after submission for the 
webpage to be updated.

6.  SDAP Processing Timeline:  PSDs may start the SDAP of a Sailor up to 
eight months retroactive to the date of the SDAP memo of the command.  SDAP 
requests that are greater than eight months must be submitted to BUPERS-328 
and will require a letter signed by the Immediate Superior in Command of the 
command explaining why the SDAP of the member was not processed in a timely 
manner.  Payments will be determined by BUPERS-328.

7.  Point of contact via e-mail MILL_INCEN_PAYS(at)navy.mil, at (901)874-
3260/DSN 882.

8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or 1 October 2018, 
whichever occurs first.

9.  You can look forward to this cumbersome administrative requirement being 
automated as we work towards implementation of our new personnel IT system.
