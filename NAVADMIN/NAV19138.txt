RMKS/1.  This message shall be read in its entirety to ensure all 
stakeholders in the ship inactivation process are aware of the projected 
retirement schedule for the upcoming fiscal year 2020 (FY-20), respective 
responsibilities and necessary follow-up actions.
Ship retirement decisions reflected in paragraph 2 below align with the 
President’s Budget for 2020 or subsequent execution year decisions made by 
leadership.

2.  To facilitate fleet planning efforts to conduct decommissioning 
continuous maintenance availability (CMAV) or inactivation availability 
(INAC), the projected schedule for inactivating U.S. battle force and non-
battle force naval vessels in FY20 is promulgated as follows:

Ship Name	Proj Inactive Date	Post Inactive Status

USS OLYMPIA		02 Jun 2020	        Dismantlement
(SSN 717)
USS LOUISVILLE	02 Jun 2020	        Dismantlement
(SSN 724)
USS CHAMPION	31 Mar 2020	        Logistics Support Asset
(MCM 4)
USS SCOUT		31 Mar 2020	        Logistics Support Asset
(MCM 8)
USS ARDENT		31 Mar 2020	        Logistics Support Asset
(MCM 12)

3.  For the purposes of this NAVADMIN, inactivation dates projected in 
paragraph 2 refer to the start of an INAC for nuclear vessels, when the 
vessels are no longer counted as part of the Navys battle force.  
Decommissioning will occur at a later date and be reported to CNO per 
reference (a).

4.  Per ref (b), Fleet Commanders shall submit an Organizational Change 
Request for commissioned U.S. ships and per reference (a) to formally notify 
the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) of a ships 
decommissioning, INAC, or end of service.  Submit revisions due to 
operational schedule changes per references (a) and (b).  It is the 
responsibility of Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command and Commander, U.S. 
Pacific Fleet in coordination with their respective TYCOM to ensure the 
appropriate lower echelon commands are notified of any changes in the ship 
inactivation schedules, as well as Integrated Warfare (OPNAV N9I) and OPNAV 
resource sponsor.

5.  Adjustments to paragraph 2 ship inactivations that cross the current 
fiscal year must be coordinated with OPNAV N9I due to reporting requirements 
that Navy must inform Congress on execution year force structure changes that 
differ from what Congress authorized/appropriated and signed into law by the 
President.  OPNAV shall promulgate changes to the inactivation fiscal year as 
required.

6.  The ships commanding officer, masters, or Immediate Superior In Command, 
shall submit a final naval message (normally transmitted in conjunction with 
the decommissioning ceremony) announcing the ships official retirement date 
and include a brief history of the significant events in the life of the ship 
per ref (a).  The Naval History and Heritage Command (NAVHISTHERITAGE 
WASHINGTON DC) and Naval Vessel Register Custodian (NVR NORFOLK VA), shall be 
included as INFO addees.

7.  Released by VADM W. R. Merz, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, Warfare 
Systems (N9).//
