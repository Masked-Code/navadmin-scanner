RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits applications for the AY19-20 Pol-Mil Masters 
(PMM) Program, with classes commencing Fall term 2019.  The PMM Program 
provides junior Navy officers a graduate education in strategy and politico-
military affairs at leading civilian universities throughout the United 
States.  The PMM program is a key component of the Navy Strategic Enterprise, 
creating through education a naval strategist cadre to be utilized in 
subsequent strategy and policy-related billets.

Restricted Line (RL) (1710, 1810, 1820, and 1830) designated officers are

Submission of official undergraduate transcripts and GRE/GMAT scores is 
highly encouraged but not required. A sample PMM application is found in

requirements.  When completing the university applications, prospective 
students should state that they are a Navy-funded Politico-Military Master's 
candidate.  PMM candidates must verify that they meet the university's work 
experience requirements and are advised to apply to at least three schools.

11 September 2018.  All supplemental information to the board (e.g. GRE 
scores and Letters of Recommendation) must be received NLT 29 October 2018.  
The selection board will convene in mid- November 2018 and results will be 
announced via NAVADMIN in December 2018.
