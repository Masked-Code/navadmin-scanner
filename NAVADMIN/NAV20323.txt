RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the notice of convening of the FY-
21 Active Duty Officer Lateral Transfer and Redesignation Boards.
The lateral transfer and redesignation process is a key tool by which the 
Navy manages the talents of its officers.  It provides flexibility in the 
Active-Duty officer community manning and improves the Navys return on 
investment in officer training and education by leveraging the specialized 
skillsets of officers throughout their careers.  As part of the process, 
applications from qualified unrestricted line, restricted line, staff corps, 
and non- off-ramp limited duty officers (LDO) will be accepted in line with 
below schedule.  Officers in LDO off-ramp communities requesting to 
redesignate within their parent community, as well as full-time support and 
selected reserve officers are not eligible to apply for this board.  All 
officers considering applying for lateral transfer or redesignation through 
this board are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with references 
(a) through (l).  Board results will be posted on the Navy Personnel Command 
(NPC) Active- Duty Lateral Transfer and Redesignation Board website - 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning.
The FY-21 Active-Duty Officer Lateral Transfer and Redesignation Board 
schedules are as follows:
   15 January 2021  Packages are due for the February 2021 Board
   12 February 2021  All addendums (fitness report (FITREPs)/

community requirements found in the lateral transfer letter of instruction 
(LOI), which can be viewed via MyNavy Portal (MNP) at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning/overview.
    a.  Officers who do not meet eligibility requirements in line with 
references (a) through (c) such as time-in-grade, years-of- commissioned 
service, or time-in-service must submit a waiver request in addition to, or 
in conjunction with, their lateral transfer and redesignation application.
    b.  All application packages must include a letter from the current 
commanding officer, acknowledging their review of the application.  It should 
include their positive or negative endorsement of the officer application and 
specifically address any waiver requests by the officer.  These letters must 
be dated within 60 days of the application deadline.
    c.  Active Component LDOs in the supply corps (651X), information warfare 
community (68XX), and submarine communication community (629X) are designated 
for off-ramp as listed in references (k) and (l).  Those who desire to 
redesignate within their parent community should submit their requests in 
line with reference (k) and (l) vice this board.

3.  Submit applications and waiver requests (as required), in line with the 
lateral transfer LOI, which can be viewed on the MNP website.

4.  Applications (including signed command endorsement) and waiver requests 
must be received in line with the dates listed in paragraph 1.

5.  The lateral transfer LOI provides officers with an indication of existing 
lateral transfer and resignation opportunities, as well as year group (YG) 
limitations.  Designators indicated are authorizing a limited number of 
Active-Duty officers to transfer from their current community.  Each YG is 
subject to change prior to the board convening.

6.  Officers are required to list their lateral transfer and redesignation 
choice(s) by priority in their application.
