PROGRAM).
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN, THE THIRD IN A SERIES CONCERNING THE JOINT 
QUALIFICATION SYSTEM (JQS), ANNOUNCES PROCEDURES FOR ON-LINE SELF- 
NOMINATION FOR JOINT CREDIT AND HIGHLIGHTS LESSONS-LEARNED FROM THE 
FIRST TWO JQS JOINT EXPERIENCE VALIDATION PANELS CONDUCTED BY THE JOINT 
STAFF (WITH NAVY/SERVICE FLAG/GENERAL OFFICER MEMBERSHIP) DURING AUGUST 
AND SEPTEMBER. 
2.  AS OUTLINED IN REFS A AND B, THE NEW JQS REPLACES THE PREVIOUS 
DESIGNATION OF JOINT SPECIALTY OFFICER (JSO) WITH THE NEW DESIGNATION, 
JOINT QUALIFIED OFFICER (JQO).  OFFICERS CONTINUE TO REQUIRE JOINT 
PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION (JPME) PHASES I AND II FOR DESIGNATION 
AS A JQO (RESERVISTS WILL SUBSTITUTE ADVANCED JPME FOR PHASE II).  THE 
PRIMARY MEANS TO ACHIEVE JOINT EXPERIENCE WILL REMAIN THROUGH AN 
ASSIGNMENT TO A JOINT BILLET LISTED ON THE JOINT DUTY ASSIGNMENT LIST 
(JDAL).  THE JQS OFFERS ALTERNATIVES AND THUS FLEXIBILITY, ALLOWING 
OFFICERS TO ACCUMULATE POINTS TOWARD JOINT QUALIFICATION THROUGH A 
COMBINATION OF JOINT EDUCATION, JOINT EXPERIENCE, JOINT TRAINING, JOINT 
EXERCISES AND OTHER MILITARY EDUCATION.  THIS ADDED FLEXIBILITY IS 
PARTICULARLY TIMELY BECAUSE BY LAW, EFFECTIVE 1 OCTOBER 2008, AN ACTIVE 
COMPONENT OFFICER MUST BE DESIGNATED AS A JQO PRIOR TO APPOINTMENT TO 
FLAG/GENERAL RANK.
3.  THE JQS SELF-NOMINATION WEB SITE, LOCATED AT 
HTTPS://WWW.DMDC.OSD.MIL/JQS/, IS ON-LINE.  OFFICERS ARE NOW ABLE TO 
SELF-NOMINATE THEIR JOINT EXPERIENCES ON THE WEB SITE FOR POINT CREDIT.  
THE WEBSITE PROVIDES DIRECTIONS FOR SELF-NOMINATION, AS WELL AS HOW TO 
SEND HARD COPY DATA SUPPORTING THE REQUESTS FOR JOINT CREDIT.  
ADDITIONAL JQS INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND ON THE NPC JOINT OFFICER 
MATTERS WEBSITE AT WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/OFFICER/JOINTOFFICER. 
OFFICERS MUST HAVE ALREADY COMPLETED THE EXPERIENCE TOUR FOR WHICH THEY 
ARE SELF-NOMINATING.  THE WEBSITE SHOULD NOT BE USED TO SELF- NOMINATE 
FOR JPME COMPLETION.  GUIDANCE FOR SUBMISSION OF REQUESTS FOR POINTS 
FOR OTHER JOINT TRAINING AND JOINT EXERCISES WILL BE PROMULGATED AT A 
LATER DATE.
4.  OFFICERS MAY NOMINATE THEIR EXPERIENCES FROM JOINT ENVIRONMENTS, AS 
WELL AS FOR JOINT EXPERIENCE IN SERVICE SPECIFIC (NAVY) BILLETS. 
THE FOLLOWING JOINT STAFF LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER 
2007 JQS PANELS APPLY.
    A.  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT PERFORMANCE REPORTS/EVALUATIONS, AND 
AWARDS, AS APPROPRIATE, CLEARLY ARTICULATE ACTIONS RELATED TO THE 
OFFICER?S PERFORMANCE IN JOINT MATTERS.  OFFICERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO USE 
QUOTES, AS APPLICABLE, FROM THESE DOCUMENTS IN THE NARRATIVE PART OF 
THEIR JOINT EXPERIENCE SELF-NOMINATION INPUTS.
    B.  OFFICERS WHO APPLY FOR EXPERIENCE POINTS FROM DUTIES WHILE 
SERVING IN NON-JDAL POSITIONS THAT ARE IN JOINT ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS 
JTFS AND UNITS ON THE WORLDWIDE IA/JTF LISTING WILL NOT NORMALLY BE 
EXPECTED TO PROVIDE AS MUCH JOINT MATTERS JUSTIFICATION VIA PERFORMANCE 
REPORTS AND AWARDS, AS OFFICERS WHO SERVED IN OWN- SERVICE POSITIONS.
    C.  PANELS WILL UNDERSTANDABLY LOOK FOR MORE RIGOR IN AN OFFICER?S 
JUSTIFYING DOCUMENTATION FOR JOINT EXPERIENCE REQUESTS FOR PERIODS 
WHILE SERVING IN OWN-SERVICE POSITIONS. IN THESE CASES, THERE MUST BE 
CLEAR AND COMPELLING INDICATION THAT THE OFFICER WAS REGULARLY INVOLVED 
IN DUTIES MEETING THE DEFINITION OF JOINT MATTERS.
    D.  OFFICERS SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR IN EXPLAINING ANY UNIT OR 
POSITIONAL DUAL-HAT ARRANGEMENTS/RELATIONSHIPS IN SUPPORT OF THEIR 
JOINT EXPERIENCE.  FOR EXAMPLE, CAREFULLY EXPLAIN THE NATURE OF DUTY IN 
OWN-SERVICE MILITARY UNITS THAT ALSO HAVE NATO OR STANDING JTF 
HEADQUARTERS DUAL-HATTED FUNCTIONS.
    E.  OFFICERS MUST ALSO CAREFULLY SPECIFY, IF THEY WERE SERVING IN 
POSITIONS THEY BELIEVED HAD A HIGHER THAN STEADY STATE INTENSITY FACTOR, 
(E.G., 2 OR 3), WHEN THE HIGHER INTENSITY PERIOD BEGAN AND ENDED, AND 
THE UNIT THEY WERE ASSIGNED IN AT THE TIME.  OFFICERS SHOULD PROVIDE 
JUSTIFYING DOCUMENTS SUCH AS LES INFORMATION SHOWING RECEIPT OF HOSTILE 
FIRE PAY/IMMINENT DANGER PAY, TO SUPPORT REQUESTED PERIODS FOR 
INTENSITY FACTOR 3.
5.  IT IS CRITICAL THAT REPORTING SENIORS CAPTURE JOINT EXPERIENCES IN 
FITREPS AND AWARD CITATIONS, WHERE APPLICABLE.  REPORTING SENIORS 
SHOULD BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE DEFINITION OF JOINT MATTERS PER REFS C 
AND D AND INCLUDE REFERENCES IN FITNESS REPORTS AND AWARDS CITATIONS, 
WHERE APPROPRIATE.  OFFICERS SHOULD FORWARD SUFFICIENT SUPPORTING 
MATERIAL TO ALLOW JQS PANELS TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE JOINT NATURE OF 
THE EXPERIENCE AND THE TYPE OF FORCE TO WHICH ASSIGNED.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
AN OFFICER ON AN INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION ASSIGNMENT MAY INCLUDE A 
LETTER FROM HIS/HER (JOINT, COALITION, OTHER SERVICE, INTERAGENCY, AND 
NON-GOVERNMENTAL) SENIOR DETAILING THE JOINT NATURE OF THE ASSIGNMENT, 
ALONG WITH FITNESS REPORTS AND AWARD CITATIONS AS APPROPRIATE.  
SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION MUST CLEARLY INDICATE THE START AND END DATE 
OF THE ASSIGNMENT; THEREFORE THE ASSIGNMENT MUST BE COMPLETED PRIOR TO 
SUBMISSION.
6.  BOTH ACTIVE AND RESERVE OFFICERS MAY SUBMIT PACKAGES FOR EXPERIENCE 
TOURS RETROACTIVE TO 11 SEPTEMBER 2001.  ADDITIONALLY, RESERVE OFFICERS 
MAY SUBMIT PACKAGES FOR EXPERIENCE TOURS IN A JDAL BILLET (I.E., OSD, 
JOINT STAFF, COCOM HEADQUARTERS) RETROACTIVE TO 1986.  OSD AND THE 
JOINT STAFF IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SERVICES ARE STILL DEVELOPING 
POLICY DETAILS FOR AWARDING POINTS TO RESERVE OFFICERS, WITH THE FIRST 
RESERVE JQS PANEL YET TO BE SCHEDULED.  A SEPARATE NAVADMIN WILL BE 
ISSUED AT A LATER DATE WHEN MORE DETAILS OF THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM FOR 
RESERVE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN MORE FULLY DETERMINED.
