RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN message announces the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Training 
and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) Aviation Department Head Retention 
Bonus (ADHRB) Program in line with references (a) and (b).  A vital part of 
developing a total force strategy and maintaining combat readiness is to 
provide appropriate incentives to retain skilled personnel for critical naval 
aviation enterprise billets.  The TAR ADHRB Program provides selected bonuses 
as an incentive to eligible pilots and naval flight officers serving in 
department head (DH) billets during FY-23 and to retain those officers 
through a post-DH aviation staff tour.

2.  The TAR ADHRB Program continues the bonus system of previous years 
directly tied to force structure and targets initial eligible aviators.  
Annual DH rates of up to $35,000 are listed below and vary by community.  DH 
retention bonuses will be paid in three or five equal annual installments.  
If a signed contract is received before completing 12 months of their initial 
DH tour, the Service member is eligible for the 5-year contract beginning on 
their 1-year anniversary in the DH squadron.  Service members may sign up for 
the 3-year contract at any time during their initial DH tour but will not be 
approved until after their 1-year anniversary in the DH squadron.  The 
following are the dollar rates for squadron DH
contracts:
 HM - Pilot                     $25,000/yr
 HSC - Pilot                    $15,000/yr
 HSM - Pilot                    $25,000/yr
 HT - Pilot                     $15,000/yr
 VAQ - Pilot                    $25,000/yr
 VAQ - NFO                      $15,000/yr
 VFA/C - Pilot/NFO              $35,000/yr
 VP/VUP - Pilot/NFO             $35,000/yr

 VT(JET) - Pilot/NFO            $35,000/yr
 VT(PROP) - Pilot/NFO           $35,000/yr
