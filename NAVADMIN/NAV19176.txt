RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance for the 2019 Meritorious Advancement 
Program (MAP) Season Two from 1 September through
31 October 2019 for Active-Duty, Full-Time Support and Canvasser Recruiter 
Service Members and contains the new automation process for MAP nominations 
within the web version of Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).

2.  2019 MAP Season Two Guidance.  Continuing from 2019 MAP Season One, the 
following initiatives remain in effect:  10 percent of the total fiscal year 
2019 advancement quotas have been allocated to
2019 MAP Season Two, alignment with the Navy-wide advancement exam cycle, 
elimination of the redistribution season, approval to use E-4 quotas to 
advance any E-1 through E-3 Service Members to the next higher pay grade on a 
one-for-one basis and meritoriously advancing Service Members who are in a 
frocked status.  The controlled rating process will be eliminated for 2019 
MAP Season Two due to minimal impacts to community health.  For additional 
guidance regarding MAP eligibility, quota substitutions, professional 
apprenticeship career track Service Members and Recruiter of the Quarter 
Program please visit MyNavy Portal (MNP) at
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/a-enlisted-
advancement-resources-and-links then select the *Websites* tab in the blue 
banner, select *MAP* and then select the *2019 MAP Season Two Info Sheet* 
tab.

3.  MAP Automation Process.  In support of Sailor 2025, MAP is transitioning 
from a manual submission process to an automated process within NSIPS.  This 
iteration covers the Active Component and a future system update will cover 
the Reserve Component.

4.  NSIPS Web Afloat Users.  Commands without access to NSIPS must submit 
their MAP nomination request via e-mail directly to their immediate superior 
in command (ISIC), type commander (TYCOM) or budget submitting office 
(BSO)/echelon II command using the Meritorious Certification Letter (MCL).  
The letter must be signed by the commanding officer and should address any 
exceptions to policy (ETP) and/or additional quotas requested.  Sample MCLs 
and detailed information regarding the NSIPS web afloat user process can be 
found via MNP at the *MAP* tab and then select the *Meritorious Certification 
Letter (MCL) Template* and *Offline Process*.

5.  MAP Automation Changes.  MAP enhancements will have a significant impact 
to the advancement process and polices as outlined in reference (a).  The 
following changes will be implemented on 1 September 2019:
    a.  Quota usage, modifications and distribution will be managed within 
the NSIPS environment.  BSO and command quotas have been uploaded into NSIPS 
and can be found under the quota summary report tab.  Quotas can also be 
found via MNP at the *MAP* tab and then select the *MAP Quotas*.
    b.  The current paper MCL process will be replaced by an eligibility and 
nomination list in NSIPS.  Commands are now required to submit their MAP 
advancement through NSIPS and are no longer permitted to submit paper MCLs to 
the Navy Personnel Command, Enlisted Advancement Branch.  Commands without 
access to NSIPS should submit their MCLs via e-mail to their ISIC as detailed 
in paragraph 4.  The system will use authoritative data to determine 
eligibility.  However, commands are still required to locally validate that 
MAP candidates have completed the professional military knowledge eligibility 
examination requirement by 1 September 2019 as outlined in reference (b).
    c.  Additional quotas can be requested using the quota request option.  
Commands must contact their BSO to determine timeline for additional quota 
requests.  All commands are authorized to request quotas from their 
BSO/echelon II command, via their ISIC and TYCOM, whether or not command 
quotas are authorized.
    d.  The system will automatically determine if an ETP is required, using 
predetermined criteria.  Service Members in ratings requiring security 
clearances and rates/pay grades requiring time in rate (TIR) waivers will be 
automatically routed for adjudication.
The request will be routed through the ISIC, TYCOM and BSO/echelon II command 
using a hierarchical workflow.  However, nuclear-trained Service Members must 
have an E-5 TIR date of 1 July 2017 or earlier to be eligible for advancement 
to E-6 during 2019 MAP Season Two.
NSIPS will not automatically generate an ETP for nuclear-trained Service 
Members who do not have sufficient TIR.  If a command desires to advance a 
nuclear-trained Service Members not meeting the TIR requirement, the ETP must 
be routed to Director, Military Personnel Plans and Policy via Nuclear 
Program Manager.
    e.  The MAP hierarchy structure in NSIPS provides the routing workflow 
between senior and subordinate commands within each respective chain of 
command and also establishes security requirements when determining system 
access.  Commands are highly encouraged to validate the accuracy of their 
command hierarchy using the unit identification code (UIC) hierarchy tab 
within NSIPS and submit all inquiries and change requests via e-mail to 
altn_map(at)navy.mil.
    f.   NSIPS web afloat users are required to follow the
procedures outlined in paragraph 5c to request additional quotas and 
paragraph 5d for ETP guidance.

6.  Account Access and Roles.  Commands with access to NSIPS are directed to 
set up their MAP user roles in preparation for 2019 MAP Season Two, which 
will commence 1 September 2019.  Commands with allocated MAP quotas are 
required to have the command reviewer and command reporting senior user roles 
established by 31 August 2019.
ISICs, TYCOMs and BSO/echelon II commands must also designate a command 
reviewer and command reporting senior to support subordinate command MAP 
advancement requests as delineated in the MAP hierarchy structure in NSIPS.  
For account access, initiate the System Authorization Access Request Navy 
(SAAR-N) form from the NSIPS menu, *New Users* link.  The title, command 
reporting senior is not meant to be the commanding officer.  Rather, the role 
must be filled by an
E-7 or above (or the civilian equivalent), who completes a SAAR-N form and 
Appointment/Termination Record-Authorized Signature (DD Form 577).  The 
remaining user roles only require the completion of the SAAR-N form.  
Additional information regarding user roles and access requirements can be 
found via MNP at the *MAP NSIPS User
Guide* tab.

7.  Tutorials.  Training modules for MAP are posted on the NSIPS main page 
beneath the training section.  These tutorials include topics associated with 
user roles and detailed procedures to perform various MAP tasks.

8.  MAP Website.  Example forms, frequently asked questions and points of 
contact for each BSO/echelon II command and list of parent and subordinate 
UICs can be downloaded via MNP at the *MAP* tab.

9.  The point of contact is MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) at
(833) 330-6622 or via e-mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil.

10.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
