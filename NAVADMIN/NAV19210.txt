As a follow-up to references (a) and (b), this NAVADMIN serves as 
notification of a new Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise Secure Access 
File Exchange (SAFE) capability.  DoD SAFE is available at 
https://safe.apps.mil and offers a no-cost, enterprise-wide method of 
securely transferring large files.  This is the general use replacement for 
the Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center 
(AMRDEC) SAFE website.
2.  Features include online exchange of data files (up to 8 GB) between DoD, 
other governmental, and civilian agencies.  The service offers encryption 
capability for sensitive information to include For Official Use Only (FOUO), 
Personally Identifiable Information
(PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI).  DoD SAFE is approved for 
unclassified data exchange only.
3.  Alternative methods of information exchange outlined in reference
(a) remain valid options, except for the discontinued Army Research 
Laboratory Safe Access File Exchange (ARL SAFE).  Commercial information 
technology service alternatives are not authorized.  All parties are 
encouraged to exercise the best practice of sharing links rather than large 
files when practical.  Chief Information Officers and security managers are 
responsible to ensure all practices comply with regulations governing PII/PHI 
and other content.
