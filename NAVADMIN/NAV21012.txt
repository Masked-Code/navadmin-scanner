SUBJ/NOTICE OF CONVENING FY-22-1 TEST PILOT SCHOOL SELECTION BOARD//

REF/A/DOC/BUPERS/06JAN21//

NARR/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1500.62E, TEST PILOT SCHOOLS//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces convening of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot 
School (USNTPS) Selection Board on 24 February 2021.  This board will select 
highly qualified Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers (NFO) for USNTPS.  
Test Pilot School (TPS) graduates have significant and long-lasting influence 
on platforms and systems that directly impact the future warfighting 
capability of the fleet.
Request command and fleet community assistance to identify candidates with 
strong operational performance and ideally, strong academic backgrounds in 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics fields of study.

2.  To be eligible for board consideration, a command-endorsed application in 
accordance with reference (a), must be received by MyNavy Career Center 
(MNCC) no later than 27 January 2021.
Additional documentation (including Wing/CAG endorsements, letters of 
recommendation, FITREPs, etc.) will be accepted until 12 February 2021, but 
must be submitted by the applicant, as a letter to the board, in line with 
subparagraph 4a below.  The e-mail address(es), phone number(s), college 
transcripts and post-TPS test squadron assignment preferences of the 
applicant must be included with the application.  Current contact information 
(ashore/afloat) of commanding officer must be included to expedite 
notification, if selected.

3.  The command endorsement shall explicitly state whether the applicant, if 
selected, will be allowed and available to report for pre-arrival training by 
the following dates:
    a.  1 June 2021 for Fixed Wing pilots
    b.  28 June 2021 for Rotary Wing pilots
    c.  2 August 2021 for NFOs
Endorsements with availability dates after these respective dates may be 
removed from consideration and not reviewed by the board.
Inability for the applicant to meet the above date may be mitigated by 
conducting initial training in a temporary additional duty
(TEMADD) status at the expense of the endorsing command.  If this is 
required, it must be explicitly stated in the command endorsement that the 
endorsing command will provide TEMADD funds until the applicant can 
officially detach.

of lieutenant commander may be selected if they are able to serve a 36-month 
follow-on test tour and still meet career milestones.
