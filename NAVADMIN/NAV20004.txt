instruction.

2.  Eligibility of Wear Criteria.  The SWO leather jacket is designated as 
organizational clothing with the exclusive designation for SWO community 
members of the U.S. Navy.  Eligibility criteria for issue and wear are as 
follows:
    a.  Active, Reserve and Full-Time Support (FTS) officers with designators 
1110, 1115, 1117 who have earned the SWO qualification in line with reference 
(b) are authorized to wear.
    b.  SWOs with designator 1113 are authorized to wear the SWO leather 
jacket if issued while on Active-Duty or during reserve support assignments.
    c.  Officers who earn a surface warfare qualification and are issued a 
SWO leather jacket while serving in designators 1110, 1115 and 1117 and 
transfer to other designators are authorized to continue wearing the SWO 
leather jacket.  Officers who transferred from designators 1110, 1115 and

jacket.
    d.  Retired SWOs will not be issued SWO leather jacket.
