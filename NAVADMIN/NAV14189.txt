RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the two new mandated requirements with 
regard to accountability for certain sex-related offenses per references (a) 
and (b).

2.  Requirements:
    a.  The inclusion of disposition information on certain sex-related 
offenses in the personnel service records (PSR) of service members.
    b.  The mandatory review of each service member*s personnel record 
notation of those sex-related offenses by the service member*s commander, 
commanding officer (CO), or officer in charge (OIC).

3.  The purpose of including disposition information on certain sex-related 
offenses in PSRs is to alert commanders, COs, and OICs of members in their 
commands who received a court-martial conviction or non-judicial punishment 
(NJP) for these offenses to reduce the likelihood that repeat offenses will 
escape the notice of commanders, COs, and OICs.

4.  Per references (a) and (b), commanders, COs, and OICs shall submit and 
file the Sex Offense Accountability Record (NAVPERS 1070/887) in a member*s 
official military personnel file (OMPF) where it will remain for the duration 
of his or her career.

5.  Effective immediately, NAVPERS 1070/887 will be used to annotate the 
service record of any service member who is convicted at court-martial or 
awarded NJP for any sex-related offense(s) listed in paragraph 6 below.  
NAVPERS 1070/887 will be submitted within two business days of the court-
martial conviction or imposition of NJP through e-submission (e-Sub) for 
those with e-Sub access, or via mail from commands without e-Sub capability 
to:
Navy Personnel Command
PERS-313
5720 Integrity Drive
Millington, TN 38055

NAVPERS 1070/887 will be filed in the service member*s OMPF under field code 
91 (FC 91).  Once the OMPF is updated, NAVPERS 1070/887 will be available for 
commanders, COs, and OICs to review using the OMPF command view application 
on BUPERS Online (BOL).

6.  Sex-related offenses under this requirement include a violation of 
Articles 120, 120a, 120b, 120c, or 125 of the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice (UCMJ); or an attempt to commit any of these offenses punishable 
under Article 80, UCMJ.

7.  In the Navy, the term punitive administrative action, as delineated in 
references (a) and (b), is limited to punishments imposed by court-martial or 
NJP (e.g., punitive letters of reprimand).  Therefore, the punitive 
administrative action option in NAVPERS 1070/887 is inapplicable and should 
not be used.

8.  Commanders, COs, and OICs are required to review all documents in FC 91 
for all newly reporting personnel within 30 days.  In order to identify these 
documents in a member*s record, the OMPF can be sorted by form number NAVPERS 
1070/887 or by FC 91.

9.  NAVPERS 1070/887 is a fillable form and is available online at the 
following website:  www.public.navy.mil/bupers- 
npc/reference/forms/Pages/default.aspx.

10.  These requirements do not supersede any requirements for reporting or 
processing NJP or court-martial actions as required by the MILPERSMAN, 
requirements for reporting incidents of sexual assault stipulated in 
references (c) through (e), or requirements to submit the Sexual Assault 
Disposition Report (NAVPERS 1752/1).

11.  Point of contact is LT Christopher Labissiere, OPNAV N17, at (703) 604-
6989/DSN 664 or via e-mail at christopher.labissiere(at)navy.mil.

12.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.

13.  Released by Vice Admiral W. F. Moran, N1.//
