RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the alignment with the U.S. Navy's 
Enlisted Leadership Development continuum.  The U.S. Navy Senior 
Enlisted Academy (SEA) has ensured capacity to afford every Navy 
senior chief petty officer (SCPO) the opportunity to attend the SEA 
prior to selection to master chief petty officer (MCPO). 
 
2.  Starting in Fiscal Year (FY) 2026, all U.S. Navy Active Duty, 
Training and Administration of the Reserves and Selected Reserve 
SCPOs will be required to complete the SEA in Newport, Rhode Island, 
or attend either the Air Force Senior Noncommissioned Officer 
Academy, Marine Corps Senior Enlisted Academy, Coast Guard Senior 
Enlisted Leadership Course, Army Sergeants Major Academy, or the 
Joint Special Operations Forces Senior Enlisted Academy in order to 
be eligible for advancement to MCPO.  Reference (a) reflects the 
course construct and the number of classes offered per year.  From 
the SEA and student perspectives, the current distance learning and 
in-resident construct significantly reduces the Sailor's time away 
from home and parent command, while not compromising educational 
content. 
 
3.  Those Sailors who have already earned the rank of MCPO or are 
selected prior to the FY26 MCPO board will be grandfathered under 
the old policy and will not be required to attend the SEA.  The 
course still remains a requirement for those who apply for the 
Command Senior Enlisted Leader program. 
 
4.  Limited funding will be available during a permanent change of 
station transfer.  The vast majority of SCPOs will attend the SEA on 
temporary assigned duty orders.  The primary funding for the program 
will come from Naval Education and Training Command. 
 
5.  Eligibility requirements are provided in reference (b). 
 
6.  For additional information, refer to the SEA website at 
https://www.netc.navy.mil/SEA/ for the course schedule and 
enrollment procedures. 
 
7.  The Senior Enlisted Academy's points of contact are the SEA 
Director at (401) 841-2912, the SEA Deputy Director at (401) 841- 
4946, and the SEA Course Director at (401) 841-4944. 
 
8.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
