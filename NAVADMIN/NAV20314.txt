RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the guidance for the administration of the 
spring 2021 (cycle 108) Navy-wide Advancement Exam (NWAE) for Selected 
Reserve (SELRES) Sailors in paygrades E-5 through E-7 and
E-4 Prior Service Reenlisted Eligibility Reserve (PRISE-R) candidates and the 
use of an alternative final multiple score (FMS) rank-order method without an 
exam for all other E-4 advancement candidates.  As a continued safety measure 
during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, E-4 exams (with the 
exception of PRISE-R) have been cancelled and an expanded testing window has 
been established for E-4 PRISE-R, E-5 and E-6 candidates.  E-7 candidates 
will complete their exams from 1-28 February in order to meet deadlines for 
the Chief selection boards.  These expanded testing windows will allow for 
smaller groups of test takers to ensure adequate social distancing can be 
maintained between testers at testing facilities, while maintaining the high 
standards and continued culture of learning that drive our enlisted 
advancement system.  Information pertaining to selection board criteria will 
be promulgated via a future NAVADMIN.  All candidates serving on voluntary 
recall, mobilization or as Canvasser Recruiters (CANREC) will compete for 
advancement as a SELRES.  This is a change from previous policy, which 
stipulated that CANREC Sailors take the Active Duty/Full Time Support exam.

2.  Timeline
    a.  1 January 2021:  PMK-EE completion deadline
    b.  1-28 February 2021:  E-7 exam administration

must still be completed by this date.

3.  Eligibility Requirements.  For all E-4 through E-7 candidates, 
eligibility requirements are found in chapter 2 of reference (a), with the 
following information specific only to cycle 108:
    a.  The terminal eligibility date used to compute time-in-rate (TIR) for 
E-4 through E-6 is 1 July 2021 and for E-7 is 1 January 2022.
    b.  The minimum TIR date must be on or before:
        (1) E-7  1 January 2019
        (2) E-6 - 1 July 2018
        (3) E-5 - 1 July 2020
        (4) E-4 - 1 January 2021
    c.  E-6 and E-7 candidates TIR requirements for early promote Sailors can 
be waived by 1 year with commanding officer (CO)/officer-in-charge(OIC) 
approval, in line with paragraph 214 of reference (a).
    d.  High-year tenure (HYT) date for E-4 through E-6 must be effective 1 
July 2021 or later.  HYT date for E-7 must be effective 1 September 2021 or 
later.  Any HYT waiver must be approved prior to 1 February 2021.
    e.  Candidates who have submitted a formal written request for voluntary 
transfer to the retired reserve (with or without pay) or Fleet Reserve on a 
date prior to their mandated HYT are ineligible for advancement.
    f.  Candidates in a rating requiring a security clearance must have a 
favorable investigation adjudication by the Department of Defense Central 
Adjudication Facility reflected properly in the Joint Personnel Adjudication 
System (JPAS) prior to 1 February 2021.
If the CO of the candidate grants an interim clearance, it must be entered in 
JPAS prior to 1 February 2021.  Candidates must maintain security clearance 
eligibility throughout the advancement cycle to be eligible for advancement.  
If, for any reason, a clearance is denied, revoked or not reflected in JPAS, 
an exam is not authorized and commands will not allow candidates to take the 
exam until the discrepancy is corrected or a new clearance is granted and is 
properly reflected in candidates EAW.  Ratings requiring a security clearance 
are AC, AE, AG, AO, AT, AWF, AWO, AWR, AWS, AZ, CTI, CTN, CTR, CTT, EOD, ET, 
ETR, ETV, FC, FCA, GM, HT, IS, IT, ITS, LN, MA, MC, MMA, TM, MN, ND, OS, QM, 
SB, SO, STG, STS and YN.  Refer to references (a) and (b) for additional 
guidance.
    g.  Branch class and special program indicator (SPI) code.  All SELRES 
and CANREC are required to take the cycle 108 SELRES NWAE.
Full-Time Support Personnel with a SPI code of V will take cycle 250
(E-7) or cycle 251 (E-4 through E-6) Active-Duty NWAEs.
    h.  PRISE-R Sailors required to participate in the NWAE to complete their 
rate conversion are only required to complete the professional military 
knowledge - eligibility exam (PMK-EE) if they are an E-3 and are eligible for 
advancement in conjunction with testing to complete rate conversion.
    i.  For candidates for advancement to E-4 and E-5, compute performance 
mark average (PMA) using all applicable evaluations in the current pay grade 
of the candidate with an ending date that falls within the following periods:
        (1) E-4 - 1 June 2020 to 31 January 2021
        (2) E-5 - 1 February 2020 to 31 January 2021
    j.  For candidates for advancement to E-6 and E-7, calculate the  
eporting seniors cumulative average (RSCA) PMA, as outlined in reference (c), 
using evaluations in the current paygrade of the candidate with the ending 
date that falls within the time periods:
        (1) E-6 - 1 February 2018 to 31 January 2021
        (2) E-7 - 1 February 2018 to 31 December 2020
    k.  Refer to reference (c) and paragraph 308 of reference (a) for 
additional guidance on RSCA PMA and PMA including guidance on establishing 
PMA for new accessions that have graduated from A-school and do not have a 
current evaluation.
    l.  For guidance on establishing EAW user roles and completing 
worksheets, refer to reference (d).  EAW is mandatory for cycle 108 and will 
be the authority for PMA, RSCA PMA and awards.
    m.  PMK-EE is mandatory for cycle 108 candidates, even if no NWAE is 
being administered, and must be completed prior to 1 January 2021 in 
accordance with reference (e).  No Sailor should be permitted to participate 
in the advancement cycle without having a completed PMK-EE captured in EAW.
    n.  Commands must accurately validate, complete and finalize all
E-4 EAWs in the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).
EAW accuracy is critical since NEAS will be reprogrammed to use finalized 
EAWs rather than the candidate exam answer sheets to create E-4 candidate 
records.  The success of this process will be dependent upon the accurate 
completion of E-4 EAWs to establish advancement cycle participation.  Cycle 
108 E-4 EAWs must be completed by 28 February 2021.

4.  Exam ordering.  Order exams in line with chapter 4 of reference (a).
    a.  Deploying commands and candidates departing to Congressionally-
Designated Combat Zones and Approved Contingency Operations Areas (CDCZ/ACOA) 
can order exams up to 6 months prior to the scheduled exam date.  For 
additional guidance, refer to chapter
4 and paragraph 614 of reference (a).
    b.  Sensitive compartmented information (SCI) exams.
Cryptologic Technician Interpretive (CTI), Cryptologic Technician Networks 
(CTN) and Cryptologic Technician Collection (CTR) SCI exam ordering dates can 
be found on the NEAS website via MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-advancement-center/my-eso.  ESOs must 
verify initial TIR eligibility lists on the NEAS website for exam ordering.  
Supplemental SCI exams are ordered via preferred message formatted e-mail to 
sfly_cryptologic.products(at)navy.mil or naval message following the 
guidelines in line with chapter 4 of reference (a).  The deadline for 
additional orders is 30 January 2021.
    c.  Non-SCI Exams.
        (1) Initial exam ordering for non-SCI exams will be available through 
13 December 2020.  ESOs must verify TIR eligibility lists on the NEAS 
website.
        (2) Eligible candidates who were not added to the initial TIR list 
can be added to a supplemental TIR list.  Supplemental TIR lists will be 
available from 14 December 2020 to 20 January 2021.
The deadline to order supplemental SELRES exams is 28 February 2021.
    d.  Exams ordered after the TIR lists have closed and exams for PRISE-R 
Sailors shall be ordered using preferred message formatted e-mail or naval 
message following the guidelines in chapter 4 of reference (a).  Ensure a 
point of contact is included in the submitted e-mail or message.
    e.  Exams for CDCZ/ACOA Sailors or recalled reservists will be ordered by 
the command holding the service record of the Service Member.  Authority is 
granted for these candidates to be administered exams with the Active-Duty 
exam administration.
However, all SELRES and CANREC candidates are still required to take the 
cycle 108 SELRES exam and not the cycle 250 (E-7) or cycle 251
(E-4 through E-6) Active-Duty exam.
    f.  When an exam is not used during the normally scheduled event, do not 
destroy the exam prior to 1 April 2021.
    g.  Cycle 108 exams should only be administered from 1 February through 
14 March.  A request for late administration must be submitted with 
justification via e-mail to sfly_N321_exam_order(at)navy.mil for permission 
to retain exams for administration on the next drill weekend.  Ensure the 
reason for a requested delay is included.  Approved late administrations must 
be administered prior to 14 April 2021.
        (1) Since SELRES may take the NWAE anytime from 1 February to 14 
March, except for E-7 candidates who must take it in February, Annual 
Training (AT) and additional Duty for Training (ADT) orders are not valid 
reasons for any Sailors to take the late exam.  ESOs shall ensure that 
Sailors take the NWAE prior to going on AT/ADT orders or when Sailors return 
from their AT/ADT.  If a Sailor will be on AT/ADT during the entire month of 
the scheduled advancement exam, then the ESO shall coordinate with the 
gaining command to forward the Sailors exam and EAW.
        (2) Naval Education and Training Professional Development Center 
(NETPDC) (N321) has the final approval for all late exam requests, but all 
SELRES late exam requests must come through the Navy Reserve Force ESOs prior 
to contacting NETPDC.  The Command ESO may e-mail the Navy Reserve Force ESOs 
at CNRFC_Reserve_Forces_ESO(at)navy.mil and carbon copy their Immediate 
Superior in Command ESOs for validation of their late exam request.
Once the Reserve Force ESOs validate the reason of the request, the Command 
ESO will request approval from NETPDC to allow the Sailor to take the late 
exam.  A request for approval from NETPDC must be submitted with 
justification via e-mail to sfly_N321_exam_order(at)navy.mil for permission 
to retain exams for late administration on the next drill weekend in March 
2021.  Ensure the reason for a requested delay is included.
    h.  ESOs must verify the exam orders at the *View Previous Exam
Orders* link via the NEAS website within 7 to 10 days of placing the order.  
If exam order discrepancies are noted, contact NETPDC (N321) as listed on the 
NEAS website at NETPDC (N321) Point of Contact Table.

5.  Exam administration and answer sheet returns
    a.  SELRES E-5 through E-6 and E-4 PRISE-R exam administrations will 
occur from 1 February through 14 March 2021.  SELRES E-7 exam administrations 
will occur from 1 February through 28 February.
Administration for all late exams will follow guidelines in references (a) 
and (b).
    b.  Every effort should be made to spread the administration of the exams 
evenly throughout the exam administration period, in order to minimize the 
number of exam-takers at any one administration to ensure maximum social 
distancing.
    c.  All commands should develop a plan to meet COVID-19 mitigations.  
Every effort should be made to ensure appropriate COVID-19 mitigation 
measures are in place, to include, but not limited to, face coverings, 
adequate social distancing, available hand sanitizer, medical (questionnaire) 
screenings and temperature checks.
    d.  Following the administration of exams, it is critical that ESOs 
expeditiously mail in answer sheet packages to NETPDC (N321).
Do not hold exams until the end of the testing window.  Prompt return of 
answer sheets will help ensure results are released in a timely manner.  For 
answer sheet return instructions, refer to chapter 6 of reference (a).
    e.  ESOs must check the exam tote board on the NEAS website often to 
ensure answer sheets have been received and processed.
Answer sheets that are in error will not be counted until they are processed 
successfully.
    f.  All candidates serving on voluntary recall, mobilization or as CANREC 
will now compete for advancement as a SELRES and participate in this 
advancement cycle.

6.  Discrepancy Correction
    a.  A detailed discrepancy list can be found at the NEAS website via 
MyNavy Portal.  For guidance on discrepancy correction requirements, refer to 
reference (a), chapters 3 and 7.
    b.  Post-exam administration discrepancy correction correspondence with 
NETPDC (N321) is to be submitted using the EAW post-exam administration 
comments (PAC) function, refer to reference (e).  All corrections must have 
CO/OIC letter and supporting documentation included as attachments.  
Education point corrections require a submission of the Joint Service 
Transcript indicating the degree type and date of completion.
    c.  For guidance on E-4 through E-6 candidates with missed exams due to 
assignment in CDCZ/ACOA, and E-7 candidates assigned to CDCZ/ACOA refer to 
chapter 6 of reference (a).
