2.  BASED ON INPUTS FROM COMMANDERS AND COMMANDING OFFICERS REGARDING 
STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR OUR NAVY'S BEST AND BRIGHTEST SAILORS, THE 
REASONS FOR SEPARATION UNDER REF A HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO DEFINE 
CATEGORIES OF UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE OR SITUATIONS IN WHICH AN

REQUIRED COUNSELING/WARNING ON A MILPERSMAN 1070/613 PRIOR TO 
SEPARATION OF MEMBERS UNDER THESE CATEGORIES.  ADDITIONAL REASONS FOR 
SEPARATION INCLUDE:

CONSECUTIVE EVALUATIONS.

IMPROVEMENT IN TWO CONSECUTIVE CYCLES.

CODE, NOT RELATED TO MEDICAL REASONS.

COMPLETE FORMAL TRAINING REQUIRED VIA PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) PROGRAM.  
    E.  SAILORS WHO LOSE ABILITY TO CARRY OR HANDLE WEAPONS IN 
PERFORMANCE OF DUTIES DUE TO LAUTENBERG AMENDMENT INVOLVING DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE.  

3.  ARTICLE 1616-010 OF REF A, DFC OF ENLISTED PERSONNEL, HAS BEEN 
CHANGED TO ALIGN THE PROCEDURES FOR DFC FOR ENLISTED PERSONNEL WITH

COMMANDER, NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (NAVPERSCOM).

4.  ARTICLE 1616-040 OF REF A, ENLISTED PERFORMANCE (E-6/7/8/9), NOW 
ADDRESSES REQUIRES COMMANDERS AND COMMANDING OFFICERS TO INFORM 
NAVPERSCOM (PERS-832) OF ANY MILITARY OR CIVILIAN DISCIPLINARY ACTION 
AND INCIDENTS INVOLVING PERFORMANCE OR CONDUCT WHICH MAY BE OF 
WIDESPREAD PUBLIC INTEREST, OR WHICH WILL REQUIRE ACTION BY NAVPERSCOM
