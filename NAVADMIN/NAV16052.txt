SUBJ/FY-17 NAVY GRADUATE EDUCATION UPDATE//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the FY-17 Navy graduate education quota 
plan.

2.  This plan provides education opportunities to enhance warfighting and 
support capabilities consistent with defense and Navy strategic guidance.
This plan prioritizes programs that develop expertise in the Middle-East,
Asia-Pacific regions, cyberspace, undersea warfare, and energy plans and 
policy.  In addition, the plan provides the foundation to sustain our 
technological advantage and develop the skills to plan for and operate the
Navy of the future while eliminating strategic and operational energy 
vulnerabilities.

3.  The FY-17 plan provides over 1,600 funded opportunities for degree and 
non-degree programs across the full spectrum of communities and ranks that 
include 412 quotas at Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), 180 quotas at top 
civilian universities, 242 quotas at the Naval War College, 379 quotas at
Joint and other service colleges, 22 quotas at international military 
colleges, and 85 quotas dedicated to fellowship and training with industry 
opportunities for 15 officer/15 enlisted personnel, and the Secretary of the 
Navy Naval innovation advisory council (5 opportunities).

4.  Enlisted graduate education opportunities will continue to be offered in 
the Cyber Systems Operation program, which allows up to five enlisted 
personnel per year to obtain a masters degree over 12 months in-residence at 
NPS.

5. The Navy continues to offer various fellowship programs, including the
Federal Executive Fellowship (15 quotas/year), White House Fellowship (1
quota/year), Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellowship (2 quotas/year),
Legislative Fellowship (15 quotas/year), and the Navy Supply Corps Training
with industry program (4 quotas/year).

6.  In addition, there are many other programs for officers to gain advanced 
education such as the political military masters program (8 quotas/year), the 
Olmsted Scholarship program (5 quotas/year), the Law Education program
(7 quotas/year), and the Unrestricted Line Graduate Education Voucher program 
(80 quotas/year).  All Navy personnel are encouraged to explore education 
opportunities with their detailer or mentor as an integral part of a career 
development strategy.

7.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
