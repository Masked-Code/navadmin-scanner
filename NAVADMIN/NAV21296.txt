RMKS/1.  The Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC) is excited to announce 
the annual New Years Day Deck Log Poem Contest for 2022 and calls for 
submissions by 2359 Eastern Daylight Time, 25 February 2022. 
 
2.  Celebratory congratulations to our winners from last year. 
First Place:  USS ROOSEVELT (DDG-80) written by LTJG Jacob C. Singleterry. 
Second Place:  USS CAPE ST. GEORGE (CG-71) written by FC1 David Sean Willis. 
Third Place:  USS LITTLE ROCK (LCS-09) written by OS1 Charles Casey Smith. 
Thank you to everyone that submitted entries for last years contest. 
We look forward to reading your 2022 entries! 
 
3.  The deck log is the official record maintained by all commissioned U.S. 
Navy vessels.  While regulations normally restrict the types of entries in 
logbooks, the Navy has long held the tradition of the Midnight New Years 
Poem. The first entry of the New Year, written in verse, allows Sailors to 
express their creativity, experience of shipboard life, and pride in their 
command.  To highlight this unique tradition, NHHC will host a New Years Day 
Deck Log Poem Contest. Sailors, we want to hear your voice. 
 
4.  Reviving aspects of our heritage like this time-honored tradition 
enhances our warfighting effectiveness.  As CNO Admiral Michael M. Gilday 
noted in FRAGO 1, As we focus on the future, we will value and celebrate our 
heritage. Harkening back to our heritage connects us with the generations of 
Sailors that came before us, creating a sense of belonging and responsibility 
to uphold their legacy of valor and sacrifice. 
 
5.  The focus of this contest is to celebrate the voices of our Sailors and 
to preserve this Navy tradition.  The contest also reminds the Fleet of the 
importance of the deck log as a historical document, one that preserves for 
future generations the actions and voices of our Sailors. 
 
6.  Contest details: 
    a.  Deadline for submissions is 2359 Eastern Daylight Time, 25 February 
2022.

    d.  Eligibility.  While it is not uncommon for squadrons and staffs to
