REF/A/DOC/COMNAVPERSCOM/5NOV18//
AMPN/REF A IS MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1401-020, ADVANCEMENT EXAM READINESS REVIEW 
(AERR)//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Advancement Examination Readiness Review 
(AERR) schedule from October 2024 through March 2025.  AERR panels provide an 
opportunity for selected rating Fleet Subject Matter Experts (FSME) from 
Fleet and shore-based commands to positively impact their respective ratings 
by updating and validating the examination question banks.  Selected Chief, 
Senior Chief, and Master Chief Petty Officers on Active Duty, Training and 
Administration of the Reserves, and Reservists currently on Active Duty for 
Operational Support may take part in the process.  AERRs enable the Navy to 
advance the most qualified and rating- knowledgeable Sailors.

2.  AERRs are held at Naval Education and Training Professional Development 
Center (NETPDC) in Pensacola, Florida.  Temporary Duty Travel (TDY) in 
support of AERR events is considered mission critical and is Flag Officer 
approved.  All costs pertaining to TDY are funded by NETPDC and will be 
conducted in line with applicable Joint Travel Regulations.

3.  In line with reference (a), Type Commanders (TYCOM) and rating sponsors 
will recruit rating FSMEs, select AERR panel members plus two alternate 
members, and provide names and contact information no less than 45 days prior 
to the AERR convening date to NETPDC via e- mail at 
NETPDC_AERR_MAILBOX@us.navy.mil with a subject line of "AERR Selectees."

selections.  Due to financial considerations, outside continental United 
States applications will only be approved for emergent, rating-specific 
needs.
