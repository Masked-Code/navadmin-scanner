NARR/REF A IS THE REVISED NAVY FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY BONUS
(FLPB) PROGRAM POLICY.  REF B IS THE FY-06 NAVY STRATEGIC LANGUAGE
LIST (SLL), WHICH IS "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" AND NOT AVAILABLE
ON-LINE.  REF B MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE POC INDICATED PARA 7
BELOW.//
REMARKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN CLARIFIES NAVY S FOREIGN LANGUAGE
PROFICIENCY BONUS (FLPB) POLICY (REF A) RELATIVE TO:
    A.  LANGUAGES DECLARED "DOMINANT IN THE FORCE" AND,
    B.  THE PAYMENT OF FLPB TO MIDSHIPMEN AT U.S. NAVAL ACADEMY
(USNA) AND IN THE NAVAL RESERVE OFFICERS TRAINING CORPS (NROTC).
2.  AS DESCRIBED IN REF A AND IDENTIFIED IN REF B, DOMINANT LANGUAGES
ARE THOSE IN WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND NAVY HAVE SUFFICIENT
CAPACITY.  AS A CONSEQUENCE, INCENTIVIZING DOMINANT LANGUAGES VIA
FLPB IS NEITHER WARRANTED NOR AUTHORIZED UNLESS AN INDIVIDUAL MEETS
THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:
    A.  A CAREER LINGUIST (I.E., CRYPTOLOGIC TECHNICIAN
(INTERPRETIVE) OR FOREIGN AREA OFFICER) IN A DOMINANT LANGUAGE, OR
    B.  SERVING IN A BILLET CODED FOR A DOMINANT LANGUAGE
3.  EFFECTIVE WITH THIS NAVADMIN, PARAGRAPH 7.B.(5) OF REF A IS
AMENDED AS FOLLOWS:  "REGARDLESS OF RANK, RATE OR BILLET, SAILORS WHO
RECEIVED LANGUAGE TRAINING AT THE DEFENSE LANGUAGE INSTITUTE (DLI) OR
OTHER DOD-APPROVED INSTITUTION ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE CONTINUOUS
FLPB PROVIDED THEY MEET THE PROFICIENCY PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH 7A IN
THE LANGUAGE FOR WHICH THEY RECEIVED INSTRUCTION.  LANGUAGES
IDENTIFIED AS DOMINANT IN THE FORCE IN THE STRATEGIC LANGUAGE LIST
ARE NOT ELIGIBLE OR AUTHORIZED FOR FLPB."
4.  SAILORS (OFFICERS AND ENLISTED) WHO DEMONSTRATE QUALIFYING
CAPABILITY VIA THE DEFENSE LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY TEST IN STRATEGIC,
NON-DOMINANT LANGUAGES REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR FLPB, REGARDLESS OF
BILLET, RATING, DESIGNATOR, OR METHOD OF LANGUAGE ACQUISITION.
5.  THE SLL IS A TOOL TO SHAPE LANGUAGE CAPABILITY/CAPACITY IN THE
FORCE AND IS REVIEWED/UPDATED ANNUALLY.  LANGUAGES INDICATED AS
STRATEGIC AND DOMINANT ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO CHANGE ON A YEARLY
BASIS.
6.  WITH RESPECT TO MIDSHIPMAN ELIGIBILITY, SINCE PROMULGATION OF REF
A, DOD OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL HAS REVIEWED THE NATIONAL DEFENSE
AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006 AND DETERMINED THAT SERVICE
ACADEMY AND ROTC MIDSHIPMEN/CADETS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MONETARY
INCENTIVES.  ACCORDINGLY, EFFECTIVE WITH THIS NAVADMIN, PAYMENT OF
FLPB IS NO LONGER AUTHORIZED FOR USNA AND NROTC MIDSHIPMEN.
PARAGRAPHS 7.B.(2), 7.B.(3), AND 7.B.(4) WILL BE AMENDED TO REFLECT
THIS CHANGE.
