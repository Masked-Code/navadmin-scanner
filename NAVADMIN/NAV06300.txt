SUBJ/OFFICIAL RECOGNITION AND ACCURATE TRACKING OF NAVY GLOBAL WAR ON
TERRORISM INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION//
RMKS/1.  THIS IS THE FOURTH IN A SERIES OF NAVADMINS DETAILING NAVY
INITIATIVES FOR OUR SAILORS WHO ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS
IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM (GWOT).  WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS,
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF NAVY INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATIONS (IA) WILL REACH
50,000 SAILORS EITHER CURRENTLY SERVING OR HAVE SERVED SINCE 2001 IN
SUPPORT OF THE GWOT.  THE EFFORT, TALENT, AND DEDICATION EXPENDED IN
THIS WAR CANNOT BE MEASURED IN MAN-DAYS OR SOME OTHER FORM OF
ARBITRARY ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.  SAILORS SERVING ON IA, AND THOSE WHO
HAVE ALREADY RETURNED, MADE SUBSTANTIAL PERSONAL SACRIFICES AND HAD
EQUALLY POSITIVE IMPACTS ON OUR NATIONS EFFORT TO BRING STABILITY
AND FREEDOM TO REGIONS THAT HAVE LONG SUFFERED FROM TYRANNY AND
OPPRESSION.  OUR NAVY IS MAKING A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THIS FIGHT AND
WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO THROUGHOUT THIS LONG WAR.
2.  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE ACCURATELY AND EXPEDITIOUSLY DOCUMENT
OUR SAILORS SERVICE IN SUPPORT OF GWOT.  TASK FORCE IA WAS CHARTERED
TO QUICKLY AND THOUGHTFULLY DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A SYSTEM TO AWARD
CREDIT FOR SAILORS IA TOURS.
3.  EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, COMMANDING OFFICERS, OFFICERS-IN-CHARGE,
AND COMMAND MASTER CHIEFS WILL ENSURE THOSE SAILORS ORDERED AWAY FROM
THEIR PARENT COMMAND RECEIVE ACCURATE RECOGNITION IN BLKS 29 AND
41/43 OF THEIR PERIODIC REGULAR FITREP/EVAL TO DOCUMENT A SAILORS IA
DATES, AND LOCATION TRAINING, AND LOCATION.  EVERY EFFORT SHALL BE
MADE TO OBTAIN A CONCURRENT FITREP/EVAL FROM THE ASSIGNED IA GAINING
COMMAND TO DOCUMENT THE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE RECEIVED WHILE
SAILORS SERVE ON IA DUTY.
4.  IN ADDITION, COS/OICS AND CMCS WILL DOCUMENT SAILORS SERVING AWAY
FROM THEIR PARENT COMMAND THROUGH THE ITEMPO REPORTING SYSTEM VIA
BUPERS ONLINE (BOL).  NAVYS ITEMPO SYSTEM PROVIDES A VEHICLE TO
ENTER AND ARCHIVE EACH SAILORS DEPLOYED EVENTS.  THIS APPLICATION
AND DATABASE WILL BE USED TO CAPTURE INFORMATION ON IA MISSIONS
(SERVED AWAY FROM A SAILORS PARENT COMMAND).  THE SAILORS PARENT
COMMAND WILL INPUT THE IA START DATE (DATE OF DETACHMENT FROM PARENT
COMMAND), PROJECTED END DATE, AND UIC FOR THE IA ASSIGNMENT LISTED ON
IA ORDERS AS ITEMPO DUTY UIC (MOST IA UICS END WITH A, E.G. 3951A
DENOTES MOB ACTIVITY IRAQ).  UPON THE SAILORS RETURN TO THEIR PARENT
COMMAND, THE COMMAND MUST REPORT THE IA END DATE THROUGH THE ITEMPO
SYSTEM.  DUE TO THE NATURE OF IA ASSIGNMENTS AND ORDERS, ALL IA
TRAINING AND TRANSIT TIME IS COUNTED AS ITEMPO DEPLOYMENT TIME.  THIS
POINT IS EMPHASIZED BECAUSE TRAINING AND TRANSIT TIME NORMALLY DO NOT
COUNT AS AN ITEMPO DEPLOYMENT EVENT.
5.  TO ACCESS THE ITEMPO ONLINE APPLICATION AND FOR MORE DETAILED
PROCEDURES REGARDING IA REPORTING IN ITEMPO SYSTEMS, REFER TO THE
ITEMPO FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS) AND USERS GUIDE:  LOGIN TO
BUPERS ONLINE AT HTTPS:(SLASH, SLASH)WWW.BOL.NAVY.MIL; FROM THE BOL
APPLICATION MENU SELECT (NAVPERS LEGACY AND ITEMPO) FOR FREQUENTLY
ASKED QUESTIONS; SELECT THE ITEMPO FAQS HYPERLINK.  FOR ITEMPO USER'S
GUIDE, SELECT THE USERS GUIDE HYPERLINK.  FOR QUESTIONS REGARDING
ITEMPO SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES, CONTACT THE ITEMPO DATA TEAM AT
(901)874-4717/DSN 882 OR E-MAIL AT MILL_LEGACYHELPDESK@NAVY.MIL.
6.  AN IA AQD HAS BEEN APPROVED AND OVER TWENTY-FIVE NEW NECS HAVE
BEEN ESTABLISHED TO CAPTURE CRITICAL SKILLS SAILORS HAVE EARNED
THROUGH TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE IN GWOT.  THIS AQD AND NECS WILL BE
ASSIGNED TO SAILORS WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED SPECIFIC IA
TRAINING AND/OR SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED AN IA TOUR OF SIX-MONTHS OR
GREATER.  COMNAVPERSCOM IS REVIEWING ALL TRAINING AND DEPLOYMENT
RECORDS TO ENSURE THAT CREDIT IS GIVEN TO THOSE WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY
COMPLETED IA TRAINING AND/OR TOUR.
7.  THIS STEP IS THE FIRST IN AN AGGRESSIVE PLAN TO PROPERLY AND
ACCURATELY DOCUMENT THE INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY OUR SAILORS
SERVING ON IA IN THE PROUD TRADITION OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY.
