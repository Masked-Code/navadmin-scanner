SUBJ/FAMILYGRAM 06-10 COMMAND SPONSOR PROGRAM AND SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT//

RMKS/1.  THIS FAMILYGRAM IS THE SIXTH IN A SERIES DESIGNED TO PROVIDE 
INFORMATION ON SUPPORT SERVICES, ASSISTANCE, AND ENTITLEMENTS AVAILABLE 
TO NAVY FAMILIES.  THIS EDITION LOOKS AT THE COMMAND SPONSOR PROGRAM 
AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO NAVY SPOUSES SEEKING EMPLOYMENT.

2.  THE COMMAND SPONSOR PROGRAM.  THE COMMAND SPONSOR PROGRAM IS ONE OF 
THE MOST IMPORTANT QUALITY OF LIFE PROGRAMS FOR SAILORS AND FAMILIES 
WHO ARE RELOCATING UNDER PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION (PCS) ORDERS.  THE 
PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO EASE THE TRANSITION OF SAILORS AND THEIR 
FAMILIES INTO NEW WORKING AND LIVING ENVIRONMENTS, MINIMIZING THE 
ANXIETY ASSOCIATED WITH PCS MOVES.  A SMOOTH TRANSITION PROVIDES 
SAILORS AND FAMILIES THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY FOR A SUCCESSFUL AND 
PRODUCTIVE TOUR OF DUTY.  THE COMMAND MASTER/SENIOR CHIEF OVERSEES THE 
SPONSOR PROGRAM ENSURING INCOMING PERSONNEL ARE ASSIGNED A SPONSOR.
    A.  SPONSOR RESPONSIBILITIES.  THE SPONSOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
INITIATING AND MAINTAINING CONTACT WITH AN INCOMING SAILOR AND THEIR 
FAMILY, PROVIDING INFORMATION REGARDING THE NEW COMMAND AND LOCAL AREA, 
AND HELPING THE NEW ARRIVAL.  THE SPONSORSHIP PROCESS BEGINS UPON 
RECEIPT OF PCS ORDERS AND CONTINUES UNTIL THE SAILOR AND FAMILY ARE 
FULLY INTEGRATED INTO THE COMMAND TEAM.  THE SPONSOR WILL MEET THE NEW 
MEMBER UPON ARRIVAL, ENSURE AVAILABILITY OF TRANSPORTATION FROM POINT 
OF ARRIVAL TO THE COMMAND, PROVIDE BASE FAMILIARIZATION INFORMATION, 
INCLUDING EXCHANGE/COMMISSARY LOCATIONS AND MEDICAL/ DENTAL FACILITIES, 
AND BE AVAILABLE TO HELP THROUGHOUT THE CHECK-IN PROCESS.  THE SPONSOR 
WILL PROVIDE A WELCOME ABOARD LETTER AND PACKAGE THROUGH THE CHAIN OF 
COMMAND.  THE LETTER WILL PROVIDE THE NAME, TELEPHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL 
ADDRESS OF THE SPONSOR.  IN THE EVENT OF RELATIVELY SHORT-FUSED ORDERS 
(E.G., "A" SCHOOL GRADUATION), IT IS IMPERATIVE THE NEW MEMBER CONTACT 
THE GAINING COMMAND, WHILE ON LEAVE OR IN TRANSIT, PROVIDE CONTACT 
INFORMATION, AND COMMUNICATE ANY NEEDS TO THE SPONSOR.  OPEN 
COMMUNICATION IS KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON 
THE COMMAND SPONSOR PROGRAM, SEE OPNAV INSTRUCTION 1740.3C AVAILABLE AT
