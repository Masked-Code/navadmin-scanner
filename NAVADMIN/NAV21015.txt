RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the Spring Fiscal Year (FY) 
2021 FTS Officer Transfer and Redesignation Board on 12 March 2021.  
Applications from qualified Active Component (AC) and Selected Reserve 
(SELRES) officers will be considered by this board.
In line with reference (a), this board will also accept applications from FTS 
officers requesting redesignation into another FTS officer community.

2.  Application requirements and procedures can be found via MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning and selecting the Full Time 
Support Redesignation link.  Complete applications with associated enclosures 
and the applicant information document must be received no later than 2359 
(CST) on 25 February 2021.

3.  Eligibility
    a.  All applicants must meet eligibility requirements outlined in 
reference (a) and the Spring FY-21 FTS eligibility criteria document.
    b.  Specific eligibility requirements are described for each designator 
and aviation community.  General eligibility criteria include projected 
rotation date (PRD), minimum service requirement (MSR), year group (YG) and 
aviation bonus (AvB) contracts.  Officers who do not meet the eligibility 
requirements will need to have a waiver approved by BUPERS-35, Head Reserve 
Officer Community Manager (OCM).
        (1) PRD.  Applicants should have a PRD no later than 30 September 
2022.  Waiver requests will need to be endorsed by your Commanding Officer 
with your application.
        (2) MSR.  AC applicants should have completed their MSR prior to 30 
September 2022.  Waiver requests (no additional documentation required by the 
applicant) will be considered on a case-by-case basis by your AC OCM.
        (3) YG.  All AC applicants are subject to AC OCM manning needs.  All 
applicants are subject to FTS OCM manning needs.  No action is required by 
the applicants.
        (4) AvB.  Aviation officers with obligated service as a result of AvB 
are eligible to apply if the officer will be within 12 months of completing 
AvB obligation or department head tour at the time the board convenes.  
Redesignation immediately following a department head tour may result in 
cancellation of AvB, which will be adjudicated by Aviation Officer 
Assignments (PERS-43).
        (5) Failure of Selection (FOS).  AC officers in a 2x FOS status for 
promotion to Lieutenant Commander are eligible to apply for FTS regardless of 
MSR and AvB contract term; a waiver request is not required.
    c.  All AC applications will be routed by the FTS OCM through the 
applicable AC OCM for community release prior to applications being sent to 
the board.  Applicants that are not released by the AC OCM will not be 
eligible for the board.  AC officers with a resignation submitted or 
Lieutenants in a 2x FOS status are eligible to apply and do not require AC 
OCM release.
    d.  Limited Duty Officers are eligible for the FTS program and must 
possess a four-year baccalaureate degree.

4.  Officers applying for multiple aviation platforms will be selected based 
on qualifications and Navy mission requirements.

5.  AC officers will incur a minimum two-year FTS obligation if selected.  In 
line with references (b) and (c), aviators selected for the VR community will 
incur a three-year FTS obligation.  All SELRES officers will incur a three-
year FTS obligation regardless of community.  All FTS obligations will begin 
on the date a Service Member redesignates as an FTS officer, unless otherwise 
stated in reference (c).

6.  Upon approval of the board proceedings, the results of the board will be 
posted on the FTS redesignation board website.  Applicants can expect to see 
the results posted within 30 days of board adjournment.  Within two weeks of 
the board results being posted, selectees will receive an acceptance package 
and will have 10 days upon receipt to accept or decline FTS 
transfer/redesignation.

7.  Points of contact are CDR Christopher Labissiere, Affiliation and 
Redesignation (PERS-92), at (901) 874-4512/DSN 882 or via email at

whichever occurs first.
