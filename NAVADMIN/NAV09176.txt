INSTRUCTION.// 
RMKS/1.  THE NAVY HAS HAD A SUPERB YEAR WITH RESPECT TO INCREASED 
RETENTION AND REDUCED ATTRITION.  ACROSS THE BOARD, LEADERSHIP AT ALL 
LEVELS IN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND AND OUR PERSONNEL INITIATIVES HAVE PAID 
DIVIDENDS.  AS EXAMPLES, WE HAVE ACHIEVED OUR FISCAL YEAR RETENTION 
GOALS IN ZONE A NUCLEAR RATINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 38 YEARS, AND OUR 
MORE STRESSED EXPEDITIONARY RATINGS AS A WHOLE ARE TRACKING ABOVE THEIR 
PREDICTED PHASING GOALS.
2.  ONE OF THE PERSONNEL TOOLS WE HAVE IS THE SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT 
BONUS (SRB); A MARKET-BASED INCENTIVE PROGRAM DESIGNED TO HELP RETAIN 
THOSE SAILORS WHO SERVE IN OUR MOST CRITICAL RATINGS AND NECS.  THIS 
YEAR, THE SRB PROGRAM IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR OTHER INITIATIVES, HAVE 
PERFORMED AS DESIGNED AND WE ARE ON TRACK TO MEET OR EXCEED MANY OF OUR 
FY-09 RETENTION GOALS, INCLUDING OUR MOST HISTORICALLY HARD TO FILL 
AREAS.  
3.  BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD SUCH GREAT SUCCESS THIS FISCAL YEAR, WE ARE NOW 
AT THE FUNDING LIMITS OF OUR CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY FOR SRB.  
MATCHING SRB'S INTENT AS A FORCE SHAPING TOOL, AND IN LIGHT OF OUR 
EXCELLENT PROGRESS THIS YEAR, WE CONSEQUENTLY ARE TEMPORARILY 
SUSPENDING THE SRB PROGRAM AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF ANY NEW REQUESTS FOR 
THE REMAINDER OF THIS FISCAL YEAR.  THESE CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE 
IMMEDIATELY.  THOSE REQUESTS WHICH HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY PERS-811 
THROUGH OPINS PRIOR TO 1600 CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME, 10 JUNE 2009, WILL 
STILL BE PROCESSED IAW REFS A, B AND C.  
4.  WE WILL BEGIN TO ACCEPT NEW SRB REQUESTS IN EARLY FY-10.  A 
SUBSEQUENT NAVADMIN WILL PROVIDE SRB WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE 
SAILORS WHO QUALIFY, AND WILL ADJUST SPECIFIC RATING AND NEC AWARD 
LEVELS TO MEET THE CRITICAL NEEDS OF OUR FORCE.  
5.  AS WE TRANSITION OUR RETENTION FOCUS TOWARDS FY-10, IT IS ESSENTIAL 
THAT THE SRB PROGRAM REMAINS FLEXIBLE AND AGILE IN ORDER TO RAPIDLY 
RESPOND TO CHANGING CONDITIONS THAT CHALLENGE OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN 
THE HEALTH OF OUR FORCE.  THEREFORE, YOU CAN EXPECT THE PROGRAM WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE APPLIED IN A DYNAMIC MANNER THROUGHOUT FY-10, AS IT WAS 
EXECUTED THIS YEAR.
6.  THE SRB PROGRAM IS ONE PIECE OF OUR WORLD-CLASS PAY AND 
COMPENSATION PACKAGE.  WHILE NOT EVERY SAILOR WILL QUALIFY FOR AN SRB, 
ALL OUR SAILORS ARE VITAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF NAVY MISSIONS.  
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE THIS OUTSTANDING PAY 
AND COMPENSATION PACKAGE THAT SUSTAINS OUR NAVY.  EACH OF YOU SHOULD BE 
PROUD OF THE TREMENDOUS JOB YOU DO EVERY DAY FOR OUR GREAT NATION.
7.  FINALLY, I OFFER MY PERSONAL APPRECIATION TO THOSE WHO PROVIDED THE 
OUTSTANDING MENTORING AND GUIDANCE IN LEADING OUR SAILORS IN 
CHALLENGING TIMES.  YOUR COVENANT LEADERSHIP HAS DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTED 
ACHIEVING OUR PERSONNEL GOALS, IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF OUR FORCE, AND 
ENSURING THE NAVY'S ABILITY TO ACCOMPLISH ITS GLOBAL MISSIONS.
