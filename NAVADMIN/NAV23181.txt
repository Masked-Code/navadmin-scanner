RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 
Navy Reserve National Command and Senior Officer (APPLY) board on 16 October 
2023.  All Selected Reserve (SELRES) officer communities will utilize the 
APPLY Board process for command and senior officer non-command assignments. 
 
2.  Eligible officers desiring a billet assignment are required to complete 
and submit all applicable sections of the APPLY application.  Applications 
must be submitted via the Reserve Forces Manpower Tools (RFMT) website 
available at https://rfmt.private.navyreserve.navy.mil/my.policy.  Officers 
are encouraged to place the maximum number of billet choices on their dream 
sheets to maximize the opportunity for an assignment.  In addition, officers 
are highly encouraged to note their willingness to accept suggested billets 
along with any travel limitations for billets not listed on their dream 
sheets.  Doing so will enable the board to select the best qualified 
applicants. 
 
3.  All correspondence to the board must be received no later than 2359 CST, 
5 October 2023.  Correspondence received after 2359 CST on 5 October 2023 
will not be accepted and will not be considered by the board. 
 
4.  Board correspondence can be submitted via the following: 
    a.  Electronic Submission of Selection Board Documents (ESSBD) is the

and-promotion/overview or the BUPERS Online main menu.  If required, an ESSBD 
users guide is available on the MyNavy HR Selection Board Support web 
page.  If unable to submit a LTB package using ESSBD 
(e.g., low bandwidth, system outage, etc.), candidates should submit 
via one of the below alternate methods.
