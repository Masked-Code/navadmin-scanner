RMKS/1.  On March 5, 2017, the U.S. Navy will proudly commemorate the 75th 
anniversary of our Fighting Seabees.  The Seabees were established in the 
dark days following the attack on Pearl Harbor to answer the crucial demand 
for builders that could fight.

2.  The Seabees have a long-standing tradition of support to the National 
Military Strategy through contingency construction since their establishment 
in 1942.  The Seabees are a proud and dedicated force with proven warfighting 
competence and character.

3.  To help convey the important role our Seabees have performed for more 
than seven decades for our U.S. Navy and Department of Defense, the Naval 
History and Heritage Command launched a Seabee 75th Anniversary Toolkit in 
January 2017.  In this toolkit, you will find historical imagery of Seabees, 
a digital resources section, as well as other commemoration and educational 
resources.

4.  For those wishing to participate in the Seabee 75th celebration, visit:  
https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/commemorations-toolkits/wwii-
75/seabee-75.html for posters, draft leaderships speeches, videos, historical 
references and other information.

5.  I encourage you to use this toolkit as we celebrate the Seabees 
throughout 2017 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the creation of the 
Naval Construction Force on March 5, 1942.  Please read, share, and 
incorporate it into your communications planning and execution throughout 
2017.
