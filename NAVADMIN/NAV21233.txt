RMKS/1.  The Navy and the Submarine Force are pleased to announce that 
applications for female Sailors in pay grades E-1 through E-8 to convert to 
Submarine Force non-nuclear trained ratings are being accepted on a 
continuous basis.  Applicants will be considered for conversion to fill open 
billets on previously integrated submarine crews and for initial enlisted 
integration of submarine crews as part of the Submarine Force integration 
plan.  Integrated submarines include USS OHIO (SSGN 726) and USS MICHIGAN 
(SSGN 727) in Bangor, WA and USS FLORIDA (SSGN 728), USS GEORGIA (SSGN 729), 
and USS WYOMING (SSBN 742) in Kings Bay, GA.
 
2.  Applications will be processed as they are received.  There is no 
specified due date.  Since available rating quotas will be filled as 
applications are processed, it is recommended that interested Sailors submit 
applications as soon as possible.  Applicants can expect to be notified by 
the Navy Personnel Command Enlisted Nuclear/Submarine Assignments Branch 
(PERS-403) and the Military Community Management, Enlisted Branch (BUPERS-32) 
of results within two months of submission.
3.  Sailors from all communities are eligible to apply for submarine service 
as part of this initiative.  Additional information regarding the selection 
process and application requirements is available via MyNavy HR at
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Enlisted/Submarine/Enlisted-Women-Submarines/.
    a.  For E-6 and below, the following submarine career fields are open for 
conversion.  The Non-Nuclear Enlisted Community Manager
(ECM) will best fit each Sailor to a rating based on their application 
package inputs and continued need for each rating.
        (1) Service support career field includes yeoman submarines (YNS), 
culinary specialist submarines (CSS), and logistics specialist submarines 
(LSS).
        (2) Submarine electronics career field includes sonar technician 
submarines (STS), fire control technician (FT), electronics technician-
navigation (ETV), missile technician (MT), and information systems technician 
submarines (ITS-electronic warfare and communications career paths).
        (3) Mechanical career field includes torpedoman (TM) and machinists 
mate-auxiliary (MMA).
    b.  Applications for pay grades E-7 and E-8 will be accepted in the 
following ratings:  ITS (see note 1), LSS, CSS and YNS (see note 2).
    c.  Sailors interested in serving as an independent duty corpsman (IDC) 
on submarines should contact the applicable force IDCs listed below for 
additional information regarding volunteering for this program.
Note 1:  E-7 and E-8 ITS conversions must have one or more of the following 
Navy enlisted classifications (NEC):  742A, H08A, 746A or equivalent.
Note 2:  E-7 and E-8 personnel specialists (PS) are encouraged to apply.  
Each application will be assessed to ensure the chief petty officer has the 
experience and expertise to manage and oversee all administrative and 
personnel actions to support the crew in the role of leading YNS aboard a 
submarine.
 
4.  All Sailors, regardless of rating or rank, must meet the following 
minimum criteria to be eligible for conversion:
    a.  Be a U.S. citizen already in possession of, or capable of receiving, 
a secret security clearance.
    b.  Meet armed services vocational aptitude battery (ASVAB) requirements 
for the desired rating(s) as outlined in reference (a).
    c.  Have no non-judicial punishments or convictions in civilian or 
military courts within the past 24 months.
    d.  Be medically screened and suitable for duty onboard a submarine in 
line with reference (b), chapter 15.  Further information regarding this 
requirement is provided in subparagraph 5.a.(7).
 
5.  Applications
    a.  The following is required for applications in line with reference 
(c):
        (1) Enlisted personnel action request (NAVPERS 1306/7) signed by the 
Sailor and endorsed by the commanding officer (CO) that clearly states the 
following:
            (a) Recommended earliest and latest release dates from the 
current command.
            (b) The submarine career field choices of the Sailor in order of 
preference.
            (c) Homeport preference for either Kings Bay, GA or Bangor, WA.
        (2) Last three performance evaluations.  Sailors with minimal service 
and less than three evaluations are still eligible and should submit all 
evaluations on record.
        (3) Physical readiness information maintenance system data covering 
the last four years of physical fitness assessment information, as available.
        (4) ASVAB scores (E-6 and below only).
        (5) Official statement volunteering for submarine service as outlined 
in reference (d).
        (6) CO recommendation letter (optional).
        (7) A completed submarine duty physical is not required for 
processing of applications.  However, candidates must have a current 
submarine duty physical approved by an undersea medical officer
(UMO) within 30 days of application submission.  Due to the nature of 
submarine service, medical fitness for duty standards are stringent.  
Therefore, interested candidates are encouraged to start this process as soon 
as possible following their decision to apply.
The Medical History Form (DD Form 2807-1) and Physical Examination Form (DD 
Form 2808) may be completed by any Department of Defense privileged provider.  
However, a UMO is required to review and approve the overall submarine duty 
physical on DD Form 2808.  UMOs are located at all submarine homeport medical 
departments.  Contact numbers and locations of submarine homeport medical 
departments and UMOs:
           (a) Submarine Readiness Squadron 32 (Groton, CT):   
(860) 694-2470/2795.
           (b) Submarine Readiness Squadron 34 (Norfolk, VA):   
(757) 967-6175.
           (c) Naval Branch Health Clinic Kings Bay (Kings Bay, GA):
(912) 573-4230.
           (d) Submarine Readiness Squadron 31 (Bangor, WA):  (360) 396-6789.
           (e) Submarine Squadron 11 (San Diego, CA):  (619) 553- 8719.

           (h) Submarine Group 7 (Yokosuka, Japan):  DSN (315) 243- 7101.
            (i) For applicants not in proximity to a submarine homeport 
listed above, contact the Force IDC, Submarine Forces, U.S.
Atlantic Fleet (COMSUBLANT):  (757) 836-1351/1354 or Force IDC, Submarine 
Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMSUBPAC):  (808) 473-
1479/5788
    b.  Sailors are encouraged to contact Submarine (Non-Nuclear) Branch 
(BUPERS-322) (see paragraph 9) to discuss ways to improve chances of 
selection and update their application.
    c.  Professional Apprentice Career Track (PACT) Sailors and junior rated 
Sailors are encouraged to apply, even with limited time in service, no 
warfare qualification or at-sea experience.  In line with reference (e), PACT 
Sailors selected for submarine service will be eligible for advancement to E-
4 upon successful completion of the training track for the selected rating 
and attainment of the required obligated service.
 
6.  Applications must be scanned and delivered to BUPERS-322.  If the social 
security number of the Service Member is included in the application, an 
encrypted email is required for submission.  An example package is available 
via MyNavy HR at:
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Enlisted/Submarine/Enlisted-Women-Submarines/.
 
7.  Prior to detailing selectees, PERS-403 will coordinate with commands to 
minimize the impact on the mission of the specific command as the Sailor 
transitions to submarine service.
8.  If a selectee is required to conduct a conversion from the reserve 
component to active component before eligible for orders, the selectee is 
required to coordinate directly with BUPERS-322 to allocate a career 
waypoints reenlistment application quota for conversion.  Failing to do so 
will result in a delay in receiving orders and follow-on assignment.
 
9.  For questions about the application process or about submarine service, 
contact BUPERS-322 Submarine Enlisted Community Manager:
    a.  CDR Steve Halle, (901) 874-2082/DSN 882,

10.  Nuclear-trained women are selected from the Nuclear Power Training Units 
(NPTU), and thus applications for nuclear-trained Sailors are no longer 
required.  Nuclear-trained women volunteering for submarine service will be 
detailed by PERS-403 in accordance with current policies and procedures.  
Female junior staff instructors or Sailors in initial training at NPTU 
interested in volunteering for submarine duty should inform their chain of 
command as soon as possible in order to adequately manage their career 
timing.  Surface nuclear-trained female Sailors, desiring to serve on 
submarines, may convert their N2XO or N2XS NEC to a N1XO or N1XS NEC by 
following reference (f), paragraph 4.a.2(b).  Submarine duty physicals must 
be completed prior to nuclear NEC conversion.
Nuclear-trained Sailors may contact the Nuclear ECM Team with any questions 
at the following:
    a.  CDR James Kepper at (703) 604-5493/DSN 664 or via e-mail at 
james.h.kepper2.mil(at)us.navy.mil.
