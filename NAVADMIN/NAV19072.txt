RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Advancement Examination Readiness Review 
(AERR) schedule from July to September 2019.  AERR events provide an 
opportunity for selected rating subject matter experts from fleet and shore-
based commands to impact Sailorization by affecting the careers of every test 
taker in the Navy.  Selected chief, senior chief, and master chief petty 
officers on Active Duty, Full-Time Support and Reservists currently on Active 
Duty for Special Work may take part in the process.  AERRs enable the Navy to 
advance the most qualified and rating-knowledgeable Sailors.

2.  AERRs are held at Naval Education and Training Professional Development 
Center (NETPDC) Pensacola, FL.  Temporary Duty Travel (TDY) in support of 
AERR events is considered mission critical and is flag officer approved.  All 
costs pertaining to TDY are funded by NETPDC.

3.  In line with reference (b), Type Commanders (TYCOM)/rating sponsors will 
recruit rating Fleet Subject Matter Experts (FSME), select AERR attendees 
plus two alternate members and provide names and contact information no less 
than 45 days prior to the AERR convening date to NETPDC using the e-mail 
sfly_netpdc_aerr(at)navy.mil with a subject line of AERR Selectees.

4.  The following AERRs are scheduled from July through September 2019.  AERR 
schedule is in the following format:

6.  In line with reference (c), nomination waivers with accompanying 
justification must be approved by NETPDC prior to TYCOM/rating sponsor 
selections.  To maximize TDY funding, Outside Continental United States 
waivers must be by NETPDC, and require justification by meeting specific 
rating skills, experience or platform/command type not available in the 
Continental United States.
