SUBJ/SUICIDE PREVENTION QUARTERLY UPDATE//

REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/04AUG09//
REF/B/DOC/OPNAV/22DEC09//
REF/C/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON DC/231556ZAPR09//
NARR/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1720.4A, WHICH ESTABLISHED THE NAVY SUICIDE 
PREVENTION PROGRAM AND DIRECTED COLLECTION OF DATA ON NAVY 
SUICIDES.  REF B, OPNAVINST F3100.6J, AND REF C, NAVADMIN 122/09, 
DIRECTED THE REPORTING OF SUICIDES AND SUICIDE-RELATED BEHAVIORS 
VIA THE OPREP-3 REPORTING SYSTEM.//

RMKS/1.  THIS YEAR SO FAR, NEARLY 700 TROUBLED SAILORS WERE REACHED 
BY A SHIPMATE, FAMILY MEMBER OR LEADER WHO REMEMBERED TO "ACT":  
(A-ASK THE QUESTION, C-CARE AND HELP THE PERSON FIND T-TREATMENT).   
THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING A SHIPMATE IN NEED.  

2.  REGRETTABLY, THOUGH, IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF 2011, WE LOST 
24 SHIPMATES TO SUICIDE.  OUR COLLECTIVE SYMPATHY GOES OUT TO THOSE 
WHO ARE PERSONALLY GRIEVING THE LOSS OF A FRIEND OR COLLEAGUE TO 
SUICIDE.  WHILE THE NATION DEPENDS ON US TO DEPLOY AROUND THE WORLD, 
CHALLENGES AT HOME ADD ADDITIONAL STRAIN AND GREATER STRESS NOT ONLY 
ON FAMILIES BUT ALSO ON SAILORS AND THEIR UNITS.  ONCE IN THE 
PSYCHOLOGICAL TUNNEL OF SUICIDAL THINKING, IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THOSE 
IN CRISIS TO SEE THEIR WAY OUT.  IT REMAINS AS IMPORTANT AS EVER TO 
MAINTAIN VIGILANCE AND BE PREPARED TO ACT TO HELP A SHIPMATE.  

3.  IT IS EASIER TODAY TO GRAB A LIFELINE WHEN IN CRISIS.  EVERY 
NAVY HOMEPAGE NOW HAS A DIRECT LIFELINE LINK TO A LIVE CHAT STAFFED 
BY VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA) PROFESSIONALS.  WE SHOULD ADD THE NATIONAL 
SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE NUMBER - 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) 
TO OUR PHONES AND OUR FAMILY MEMBER'S PHONES ALONG WITH OTHER 
EMERGENCY NUMBERS THAT ARE STORED FOR QUICK ACCESS.  JUST LIKE FIRE 
EXTINGUISHERS AND FLOTATION DEVICES, THESE PHONE AND INTERNET CHAT 
LINKS CAN BE LIFE SAVING TOOLS IF THEY ARE READY AND AVAILABLE WHEN 
HELP MAY NOT BE PHYSICALLY OR EMOTIONALLY WITHIN REACH OR WHEN WE 
SEEK EXPERT SUPPORT TO BETTER HELP A SHIPMATE IN NEED.  

4.  A NEW COMMANDER'S TOOLKIT FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE 
IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD OR WEB VIEWING AT 
WWW.SUICIDE.NAVY.MIL.  THIS PRACTICAL COLLECTION OF GUIDANCE, CHECK 
LISTS, AND TEMPLATE MATERIALS WILL ASSIST COMMANDS WITH ASSESSING 
AND DIRECTING UNIT EFFORTS TO SAVE LIVES AND SUPPORT THOSE AFFECTED 
BY A TRAGEDY.

5.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, GO TO WWW.SUICIDE.NAVY.MIL AND 
WWW.NAVYNAVSTRESS.COM.
