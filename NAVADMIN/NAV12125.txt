SUBJ/FAMILYGRAM 02-12 - FAMILY CARE PLAN//

REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/27OCT09//
AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1740.4D, U.S. NAVY FAMILY CARE POLICY.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN REITERATES THE REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDANCE 
PROVIDED IN REF A.  A CURRENT FAMILY CARE PLAN (FCP) ENSURES THAT 
SAILORS ARE MISSION READY AND HAVE A WELL THOUGHT OUT PLAN OF ACTION 
FOR THE CARE OF MINOR CHILDREN AND DEPENDENT ADULT FAMILY MEMBERS 
WHEN MILITARY RESPONSIBILITIES, DEPLOYMENTS, NORMAL AND EXTENDED 
WORKING HOURS, TEMPORARY ASSIGNED DUTY, AND WEEKEND DUTY, AMONG 
OTHERS, ARISE.  A COMPLETE AND WELL-PREPARED FCP IMPROVES INDIVIDUAL, 
UNIT AND FAMILY READINESS AND KEEPS US IN LINE WITH OUR NAVY'S 21ST 
CENTURY SAILOR AND MARINE INITIATIVE.

2.  A FCP IS REQUIRED FROM:
    A.  SAILORS WITH PRIMARY OR SHARED PHYSICAL CUSTODY OF A MINOR 
CHILD, NOT MARRIED TO THE OTHER NATURAL OR ADOPTIVE PARENT.
    B.  BOTH MEMBERS OF A MARRIED DUAL-MILITARY COUPLE WHERE ONE OR 
BOTH HAVE PRIMARY OR SHARED PHYSICAL CUSTODY OF A MINOR CHILD.
    C.  SAILORS WHO ARE LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR AN ADULT FAMILY 
MEMBER WHO IS INCAPABLE OF PROVIDING FOR THEMSELVES IN THE ABSENCE OF 
THE SERVICEMEMBER.
    D.  SAILORS WHOSE FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE THEM LEGALLY AND 
PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARE OF ANOTHER PERSON.

3.  A FCP CONSISTS OF THE FAMILY CARE CERTIFICATE (NAVPERS 1740/6), 
FAMILY CARE PLAN ARRANGEMENTS (NAVPERS 1740/7), AND LEGAL DOCUMENTS 
(E.G., CUSTODY OR SEPARATION AGREEMENTS, CUSTODY AND SUPPORT ORDERS, 
DIVORCE DECREES, ETC.) WHEN APPLICABLE.  INABILITY TO PROVIDE OR 
MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE FAMILY CARE PLAN MAY RESULT IN ADMINISTRATIVE 
SEPARATION FROM THE NAVAL SERVICE.  REF A CLARIFIES THIS REQUIREMENT.

4.  SAILORS MUST SUBMIT A NEW OR UPDATED FCP WHEN THEY:
    A.  REPORT TO A NEW DUTY STATION.
    B.  CHANGE CAREGIVER CIRCUMSTANCES.
    C.  CHANGE PERSONAL OR FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS BIRTH OR 
ADOPTION OF A CHILD.
    D.  ASSUME SOLE CARE FOR AN ELDERLY OR INCAPACITATED FAMILY 
MEMBER.

5.  THE FAMILY CARE PLAN DOES NOT CREATE A RIGHT OR ENTITLEMENT, AND 
DOES NOT SUPERCEDE A PRE-EXISTING OR SUBSEQUENT SEPARATION AGREEMENT, 
COURT ORDER, CHILD CUSTODY ORDER, OR DIVORCE DECREE THAT ADDRESSES 
CHILD CUSTODY AND SUPPORT ISSUES.  FOR QUESTIONS REGARDING YOUR 
FAMILY CARE PLAN AND ANY OF THESE COURT-RELATED MATTERS, CONSULT YOUR 
LOCAL LEGAL SERVICES OFFICE.  SUPPORT FOR CAREGIVERS DESIGNATED IN A 
FCP IS AVAILABLE NAVY-WIDE THROUGH FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS, 
NAVY/MARINE CORPS RELIEF SOCIETY, MILITARY ONE SOURCE, BASE CHILD 
DEVELOPMENT CENTERS, NAVY OPERATIONAL SUPPORT CENTERS, AND COMMUNITY 
AND FAMILY SUPPORT GROUPS.
