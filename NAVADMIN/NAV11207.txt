RMKS/1.  THIS PROMULGATES THE 2011-2012 INFLUENZA VACCINATION AND REPORTING 
GUIDANCE.  INFLUENZA OR "FLU" HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT NAVY FORCE READINESS 
AND MISSION SIGNIFICANTLY.  EACH YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES, INFLUENZA RESULTS 
IN OVER 25 MILLION REPORTED CASES, 150,000 HOSPITALIZATIONS, AND 24,000 
DEATHS.

2.  IN SUPPORT OF REFS A AND B, THE 2011-2012 INFLUENZA VACCINATION AND 
REPORTING POLICY AND INSTRUCTION FOLLOWS:
A.  INFLUENZA PREVENTION.  VACCINATION IS THE PRIMARY METHOD TO REDUCE RISK OF 
INFLUENZA.  MAINTAINING A CLEAN WORK ENVIRONMENT, GOOD HYGIENE PRACTICES, AND 
MANAGING WORKFORCE EXPOSURE (E.G., SOCIAL DISTANCING, TELE-WORKING, SICK 
LEAVE, ETC.) ARE SOME SIMPLE METHODS THAT WILL ALSO REDUCE RISK OF SPREADING 
INFLUENZA.
B.  INFLUENZA VACCINE.  THE SEASONAL TRIVALENT INFLUENZA VACCINE CONTAINS 
THREE INACTIVE VIRUS COMPONENTS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF THE MOST PREVALENT 
STRAINS FOR THE UPCOMING SEASON.  THE 2009 H1N1 PANDEMIC STRAIN IS 
INCORPORATED AS ONE OF THE THREE 2011-2012 SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE 
COMPONENTS.  NEW INFLUENZA STRAINS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME PANDEMIC HAVE 
NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR 2011-2012, BUT THE POSSIBILITY REMAINS THAT A NEW 
VIRUS STRAIN COULD EMERGE, BECOME A PANDEMIC AND REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL 
INFLUENZA VACCINE.  THE ARMED FORCES HEALTH SURVEILLANCE CENTER WILL CLOSELY 
MONITOR THE EMERGENCE OF POTENTIAL NEW VIRUS C.  INFLUENZA VACCINE PRIORITY.  
DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NAVY SHIPS ARE VACCINE PRIORITY ONE 
IN 2011.
D.  INFLUENZA VACCINE REQUISITIONS.  THE NAVY ON-LINE VACCINE INFORMATION AND 
LOGISTICS SYSTEM (VIALS) WAS ESTABLISHED IN MARCH 2010 AS THE REQUISITION 
SYSTEM FOR SEASONAL AND NEW INFLUENZA VACCINES.  NAVY VIALS REPLACES THE 
PREVIOUS PROCESS THROUGH WHICH COMMANDS INDIVIDUALLY REQUISITIONED VACCINE VIA 
MILSTRIP.  NAVY VIALS SIMPLIFIES VACCINE REQUISITIONS AND ENABLES COMMANDS TO 
TRACK VACCINE ORDERS ON-LINE FROM REQUISITION TO RECEIPT.  YOU CAN TRACK THESE 
ORDERS VIA THE VIALS WEB SITE AT 
HTTPS://GOV_ONLY.NMLC.MED.NAVY.MIL/INT_CODE03/VIALS/.
E.  INFLUENZA VACCINE ORDERING.  NAVY INFLUENZA VACCINE IS NOW BATCH-ORDERED 
BY NAVAL MEDICAL LOGISTICS COMMAND (NAVMEDLOGCOM) FROM THE DEFENSE LOGISTICS 
AGENCY (DLA) USING COMMAND REQUIREMENTS IN NAVY VIALS.  NAVY INFLUENZA VACCINE 
IS NOW CENTRALLY FUNDED.
F.  INFLUENZA VACCINE DISTRIBUTION.  THE 2011 FLU SEASON WILL BE EXECUTED AS 
IF NAVY IS IN A PANDEMIC EVENT.  NAVY COMMANDS WILL TRACK VACCINE SHIPMENTS 
VIA VIALS, COORDINATE WITH NAVMEDLOGCOM AND THEIR SERVICING MILITARY TREATMENT 
FACILITY (MTF) TO DETERMINE WHEN INFLUENZA VACCINE WILL BE AVAILABLE, AND 
CONDUCT COMMAND-WIDE VACCINATIONS UPON VACCINE ARRIVAL.
G.  INFLUENZA VACCINATION COMPLIANCE.
(1) NAVY MILITARY PERSONNEL.  PER REFS A AND B, SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINATION 
IS MANDATORY FOR ALL DOD UNIFORMED PERSONNEL WHO ARE NOT MEDICALLY OR 
ADMINISTRATIVELY EXEMPT.  ALL NAVY ACTIVE AND RESERVE COMPONENT (AC/RC) 
PERSONNEL, NOT MEDICALLY OR ADMINISTRATIVELY EXEMPT, MUST RECEIVE DOD 
INFLUENZA VACCINE(S).
REFUSAL TO RECEIVE THE INFLUENZA VACCINE(S) MAY CONSTITUTE A FAILURE TO OBEY A 
LAWFUL ORDER AND MAY BE PUNISHABLE UNDER THE UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE 
(UCMJ) AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION.  PRIOR TO RECEIVING THE INFLUENZA 
VACCINE, NAVY AC/RC PERSONNEL SHALL HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO 
DISCUSS OBJECTIONS OR CONCERNS WITH INFLUENZA VACCINATION(S).
(2) NAVY CIVILIAN PERSONNEL.  MANDATORY INFLUENZA
VACCINATION(S) IS/ARE A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT FOR ALL CIVILIAN HEALTH CARE 
WORKERS PROVIDING DIRECT PATIENT CARE IN DOD MTFS PER REF (E).  INFLUENZA 
VACCINATION(S) IS/ARE MANDATORY FOR ALL CIVILIANS WHERE IT IS WRITTEN IN THEIR 
POSITION DESCRIPTION AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT.  OTHER NAVY CIVILIAN 
PERSONNEL ARE HIGHLY ENCOURAGED BUT NOT REQUIRED TO RECEIVE INFLUENZA 
VACCINATION(S).
(3)  TRICARE BENEFICIARIES.  REF (F) ALLOWS FOR A TRICARE RETAIL NETWORK 
PHARMACY TO ADMINISTER THE SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE.
TRICARE BENEFICIARIES MAY RECEIVE INFLUENZA VACCINATION WITH NO COPAY AT ANY 
RETAIL PHARMACY OFFERING VACCINES.  CONTACT THE PHARMACY TO SEE IF THEY HAVE 
AN AGE RESTRICTION.  SOME PHARMACIES DO NOT ADMINISTER THE FLU VACCINE TO 
INDIVIDUALS LESS THAN 18 YEARS OF AGE.
H.  INFLUENZA VACCINATION REPORTING
(1) OPERATIONAL VACCINATION REPORTING.  OPERATIONAL REPORTING VIA THE NAVY 
FAMILY ACCOUNTABILITY AND ASSESSMENT SYSTEM (NFAAS) HAS CEASED AND IS NOT 
REQUIRED FOR THE 2011 INFLUENZA SEASON.  NAVY FORCE VACCINATION WILL BE 
MONITORED VIA THE MEDICAL READINESS REPORTING SYSTEM (MRRS).
I.  NAVY'S GOALS AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
(1) NAVY UNITS HAVE 72 HOURS (THREE WORKING DAYS) TO DOCUMENT, ADMINISTER, AND 
REPORT VACCINATION FROM TIME OF VACCINE RECEIPT.
NAVY RESERVE COMPONENT (RC) UNITS HAVE ONE DRILL WEEKEND TO DOCUMENT, 
ADMINISTER, AND REPORT VACCINATION FROM TIME OF VACCINE RECEIPT.  IF SHIPMENTS 
ARRIVE WITH TEMPERATURE SENSORS IN AN ALARMED STATUS, THE CLOCK BEGINS AT THE 
TIME THE VACCINE IS APPROVED FOR ADMINISTRATION
BY DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY (DLA).    UNIT SITREPS ARE REQUIRED IF
VACCINE SHIPMENTS TO COMMANDS OR COMMAND VACCINATIONS ARE DELAYED.
COMMANDS WILL COORDINATE WITH THE SERVICING MTF TO ALIGN COMMAND-WIDE 
VACCINATIONS WITH VACCINE ARRIVAL. MEDICAL PERSONNEL AT SERVICING MTFS WILL 
EXPEDITIOUSLY REPORT VACCINATIONS IN THE MEDICAL READINESS REPORTING SYSTEM 
(MRRS).
(2) THE NAVY'S VACCINATION GOAL IS 90 PERCENT VACCINATED BY
01 DEC 2011 FOR ACTIVE COMPONENT, 90 PERCENT VACCINATED BY 31 DEC
2011 FOR RESERVE COMPONENT, AND 100 PERCENT VACCINE ACCESS FOR TOTAL NAVY 
FAMILY (INCLUDES DEPENDENTS, BENEFICIARIES, DON CIVILIANS).
(3) INFLUENZA VACCINATION PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.  THE FOLLOWING MILESTONES 
WILL BE MONITORED:
- NAVY VIALS REPORTS 1.0 MILLION VACCINE DOSES ORDERED FOR
  TOTAL NAVY FAMILY BY 31 JUL 2011*
- NAVY VIALS REPORTS 100% OF FLEET DOSES SHIPPED BY
  30 SEP 2011*

  31 DEC 2011*
*DEPENDENT ON DLA RECEIVING 70% OF CONTRACTED VACCINE BY 31 AUG 2011 AND 100% 
BY 30 SEP 2011.
J.  COMMANDER, NAVY INSTALLATIONS COMMAND (CINC) AND NAVY BUREAU OF MEDICINE 
AND SURGERY (BUMED) WILL COORDINATE AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON CONDUCTING A MASS 
VACCINATION (SHOTEX) AT SELECT INSTALLATIONS.  THE SELECTED REGION WILL 
ADMINISTER A SHOTEX WITHIN TWO (2) WORKING DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THE 2011 
INFLUENZA (FLU) VACCINE.  CINC AND BUMED WILL PROVIDE OBJECTIVES AND EXECUTION 
TIMELINE VIA SEPCOR.

3.  IMPROVEMENTS TO NAVY'S INFLUENZA VACCINATION REQUISITION, ORDERING, 
DISTRIBUTION, COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING PROCEDURES ARE FOCUSED ON ENSURING NAVY 
FORCE READINESS AND MISSION ACCOMPLISHMENT BY VACCINATING THE FORCE AS QUICKLY 
AS THE VACCINE IS AVAILABLE.  IT IS CRUCIAL THAT COMMANDS ATTAIN THE NAVY 
VACCINATION GOAL OF 90 PERCENT BY 1 DECEMBER FOR AC AND 90 PERCENT BY 31 
DECEMBER FOR RC TO ENSURE FORCE READINESS.
