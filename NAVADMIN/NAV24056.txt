NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 051/24, CULTURE OF EXCELLENCE 2.0.   
REF B IS BUREAU OF NAVAL PERSONNEL CAREER COUNSELOR HANDBOOK.   
REF C IS NAVADMIN 095/18, BRILLIANT ON THE BASICS II PART A REVISITING THE 
BASICS.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN outlines the FY24 retention environment, and provides 
FY24 reenlistment rate benchmarks as well as Retention Excellence Award (REA) 
and Best in Class (BIC) criteria.
Additionally, it reemphasizes our commitment towards promoting a culture of 
excellence in line with reference (a), and the need to retain the best talent 
in a forward-operating and talent-rich Navy team.

2.  FY24 Retention Environment.  As we progress through this FY24, we are in 
a war for talent to attract, develop, and retain the very best by utilizing 
all force management levers at our disposal.
Tomorrow's Fleet readiness is reliant on retaining today's Sailors, within 
both the Active Duty and Reserve Force.
    a.  All Hands on Deck.  We MUST retain our trained and experienced 
Sailors who are personally invested in mission success by actively building 
great people, leaders, and teams.  Similarly, our leaders must think, act, 
and operate differently to encourage and foster an environment where Sailors 
want to stay Navy.
    b.  Importance of Reserve Affiliation (RA).  We depend on both the Active 
and Reserve components to maintain Fleet readiness and it remains a top 
priority.  To be accredited and calculated towards the command's reenlistment 
rate, RA can occur greater than 180 days from separation, however, it must be 
within the same FY.

3.  FY24 Reenlistment Rate Benchmarks
    a.  REA/BIC.  REA/BIC now includes 19 platform types, along with Naval 
Education and Training Command, Commander, Navy Installations Command, Navy 
Supply Systems Command, and Navy Personnel Command.
The BIC distinction highlights those commands who are optimizing the 
principles outlined in references (a) through (c).
    b.  Commands who meet their specific platform reenlistment rate (with RA) 
benchmarks and remain at or below the Navy's Zone A attrition benchmark will 
be awarded the REA and are automatically considered for BIC.  TYCOMs will 
evaluate commands who meet their respective class REA criteria and from those 
commands the "Best in Class" will be determined.  BIC recipients can be 
awarded based on individual Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC) or Type 
Command (TYCOM) determined metric.  Echelon III commands will forward the 
finalized REA/BIC awardees to the Echelon II command for release the of the 
recognition message.
    c.  FY24 Legacy and BIC reenlistment with RA benchmarks can be found on 
the MyNavy HR website at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
Management/Career-Counseling/.

4.  REA Criteria for Legacy and BIC.  If commands meet or exceed the
FY24 reenlistment benchmarks (with RA) and are at or below the attrition 
benchmark, they are eligible to receive the REA.  The benchmarks must be met 
for at least two quarters or the FY overall.
Additionally, Echelon II commands may utilize retention and Sailor related 
metrics to determine final eligibility.
    a.  An eligible command must have a designated Command Career Counselor 
(CCC) and units must have a minimum of 50 cumulative Sailors in Zones A, B 
and C identified using the non-average End of Active Obligated Service (EAOS) 
inventory.  This can be found on the "RET-ATT" report within the Navy 
Retention Monitoring System (NRMS).
Exceptions will be determined by the applicable Echelon II Commander.
    b.  Computation Exceptions.  A zone that has no Sailors reaching EAOS 
will have its reenlistment rate for that zone set to the minimum required 
benchmark required for the zone, as long as the command has qualifying 
transactions in other zones.  Commands must have a minimum of one zone with 
qualifying transactions.
    c.  Zone A attrition percentages can be recalculated to exclude any loss 
transactions for a Sailor transferred from a command due to pending 
separation, medical, or legal hold.
    d.  Sailors separated due to "Other Medical" or "Disability"
will not be counted towards the attrition benchmark and commands will utilize 
reference (b) to adjust computed attrition in Zone A to be submitted to their 
ISIC/TYCOM.
    e.  Requests for an Exception to Policy (ETP) of any award element in 
paragraph 4 must be submitted in writing via the respective ISIC/TYCOM with 
specific justification.  ETP requests must be signed by the Commanding 
Officer.  Requests disapproved at any level will not be considered.  
Disapprovals at ISIC or TYCOM level do not need to be forwarded to their 
respective Echelon II.
ETP final approval authority resides with Echelon II commands.
    f.  TYCOM and direct reporting counselors will evaluate and submit 
eligible commands to their respective Echelon II commands no later than 1 
December 2024.

5.  Legacy REA and BIC Announcement Recognition
    a.  Echelon II commands should announce their FY24 REA Legacy and BIC 
recipients following consolidation of Echelon III and direct reporting 
command submissions no later than 31 January 2025.
    b.  Following the announcement message, REA/BIC awardees may fly the BIC 
pennant (blue, with silver anchor) and paint their anchor gold as applicable.  
Legacy REA award winners and BIC contenders who meet benchmarks and who are 
not selected for BIC distinction can fly the Retention Award pennant (gold, 
with blue anchor) and paint their anchor haze grey.

6.  Career Counselor of the Year (CCOY):  A key to successful execution of 
Brilliant on the Basics as detailed in reference (c) is recognition.  The 
CCOY award provides an opportunity to recognize CCCs who manage an 
outstanding Career Development Program and serve a critical role in the 
military life cycle of a Sailor's career.
The CCOY program is maintained at the Echelon II level.
