RMKS/1.  Per references (a) and (b), this NAVADMIN outlines the process to define the billet coding, 
awarding criteria and captures a standardized medium in the cyber workforce in regards to three new 
Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) Codes for the Cryptologic Technician Networks (CTN) rating due to 
varying requirements that are outside normal Navy processes, but affect Navy commands and ultimately 
the Sailors.

2.  Defense Cyber Operations Analyst (DCOA) H30A, Adversarial Pursuit Operator (APO) H31A, and Cyber 
Threat Emulation Operator (CTEO) H32A were brought online to improve the Navy abilities to track, 
retain and distribute skilled technicians within a critical warfare area.  As the Navy leans forward to 
increase lethality in our Information Warfare Domain, we recognize our need to provide the necessary 
skills to build critical talent and skillsets in the cyber workforce.  We will deliberately and efficiently 
provide critical talent where it is most required.  To that end, the Navy will be directing rapid award of 
these NECs to Sailors who meet the criteria and immediate alignment to billets that require this skillset.

3.  Commands will work with Type Commanders (TYCOMs) to identify and code CTN billets that require 
this skillset within Total Force Manpower Management System (TFMMS) NLT 120 days from release of 
this message.  TYCOMs will serve as the final validation authority for billet coding in TFMMS.  TFMMS 
remains the authoritative database to set the proper demand and properly inform Department of Navy, 
Manpower, Personnel, Training, and Education Systems.

4.  Commanding Officers will identify and request award of these NECs for Sailors currently serving at 
their command via bulk memorandum to BUPERS-327F NLT 60 days from the release of this message.  
Award criteria is as follows:
    a.  Sailors who meet all requirements outlined in references (b) and (c).
    b.  Sailors who are currently serving on a Cyber Protection Team
(CPT) and are considered Fully Trained and Fully Qualified (FTFQ) for the Discovery and Counter 
Infiltration (DCI) role (or the equivalent CPT Mission Element) requirement for APO-H31A.
    c.  Sailors who are currently serving on a CPT and are considered FTFQ for the Cyber Threat Emulation 
(CTE) role (or the equivalent CPT Mission Element) requirement Cyber Threat Analyst role for CTEO- 
H32A.
    d.  Sailors who are currently serving on a CPT and are considered to have met the requirements for 
Intermediate Cyber Core either through course completion or granting of equivalency through official 
process (i.e. United States Cyber Command Individual Training Equivalency Board) for DCOA-H30A.
    e.  For Sailors who have met the above requirements but are no longer serving on a CPT, NEC(s) will 
be considered on a case-by-case basis outlined in subparagraph (g).
    f.  For any Sailors who do not meet the above requirements including missions outside the Cyber 
Mission Force (Fleet Information Operations Center, Navy Cyber Defense Operations Center, and Cyber 
Systems and Operations missions), the awarding of NEC(s) must include the requirements outlined in 
H30A, H31A and H32A Navy Enlisted Manpower and Personnel Classifications and Occupational 
Standards awarding criteria.
    g.  Awarding of the NEC to those Sailors outlined in subparagraphs (e) and (f) will be determined by a 
panel of Subject Matter Experts (SME) and will largely be based upon the applicability of those skills to 
their current work.  United States Fleet Cyber Command/10th Fleet is designated as the primary 
command to administer the SME panel and provide recommendations on all exceptions outside the 
above awarding criteria including any training waivers through the joint qualification requirements 
process.  BUPERS-327F will ensure that these NECs are only awarded to personnel with currently 
relevant skillsets in these areas based on the recommendation from the panel.
