RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces Cycle 094 Navy-Wide Examinations for 
advancement in rate of selected reserve (SELRES) personnel.  Inactive reserve 
examinations will be administered February 2014 for
E4/E5/E6/E7 candidates.  All candidates serving on voluntary recall, active-
duty training, or active-duty under presidential recall authority, including 
mobilization, will compete for advancement as SELRES inactive (USNR-INACTIVE) 
in Cycle 094.  Individual ready reserve (IRR) personnel who are mobilized are 
considered under the SELRES requirements for advancement.  Refer to ref (a) 
regarding advancement examination options for Sailors who are pending 
deployment to or are deployed and operating in, Iraq, Afghanistan or the Horn 
of Africa.  This NAVADMIN supplements ref (b).  Paragraph
12 contains a list of key dates and events, paragraph 13 contains a list of 
websites, and paragraph 14 contains a list of points of contact (POC) for 
quick reference.

20 December 2013 through 29 January 2014.
        (3) Once internet ordering is closed, late examination orders can be 
made via message or encrypted e-mail to sfly_n321_exam_order (at)navy.mil in 
accordance with figure 4-1 of ref (b).  Encrypted e-mail should have message 
format as an attachment with POC included in message.  The deadline for 
ordering examinations is 3 March 2014.
There are no substitute examinations for SELRES.
    c.  Commands must verify the examination order status on the NEAS website 
under "View Previous Exam Orders" within 14 days of placing examination 
orders.  If discrepancies are noted, contact NETPDTC at (850) 473-6142/DSN 
753. 
    d.  When an examination is not used, do not destroy the examination prior 
to 1 April 2014.  The last available day to administer an examination is 31 
March 2014.
    e.  Commands must verify TIR lists and take the following actions as 
required:
        (1) Eligible candidates are not listed - Commands must add candidates 
and appropriate examinations to the TIR list.
        (2) Listed candidates are not eligible or are no longer recommended 
for advancement - Commands must click "no" and then click the submit button 
to delete names from the TIR list.
        (3) Candidates no longer attached to command - Commands must delete 
or order/forward examinations, as applicable.
        (4) Appropriate examination for candidates - Commands must select 
appropriate examinations, particularly for rating conversions or separate 
competitive groups within ratings, such as ATI/ATO.  
        (5) Nuclear propulsion candidates - Since there are no nuclear 
billets within SELRES community, no nuclear power examinations are 
authorized.

3.  Eligibility requirements:
    a.  SELRES candidates must meet the basic eligibility requirements per 
ref (b), chapter 2 NLT 31 January 2014.  Candidates who do not meet 
eligibility requirements are ineligible for advancement and shall not be 
administered a Cycle 094 advancement examination.  
    b.  Terminal eligibility dates for Cycle 094 (Refer to ref (b) to compute 
TIR.):
        (1) E7 candidates - 1 January 2015.  Personnel with a TIR date of 1 
January 2012 or earlier are TIR eligible. 
        (2) E6 candidates - 1 July 2014.  Personnel with a TIR date of 1 July 
2011 or earlier are TIR eligible. 
        (3) E5 candidates - 1 July 2014.  Personnel with a TIR date of 1 July 
2013 or earlier are TIR eligible.
        (4) E4 candidates - 1 July 2014.  Personnel with a TIR date of 1 
January 2014 or earlier will be TIR eligible for this examination cycle.
    c.  Early promote (EP) TIR waiver must be in accordance with ref  (b), 
paragraph 216.f.  Candidates who have been granted EP TIR waivers must be 
identified during examination ordering, on the answer sheet, and on the 
letter of transmittal to NETPDTC (N321).  This will prevent automatic system 
invalidation as a result of insufficient TIR.
Candidates not granted an EP TIR waiver by their commanding officer
(CO) will not be eligible for consideration by either the regular or a 
special selection board.  The "EP" evaluations on which the TIR waiver is 
based must be available to the selection board prior to the board convening 
date; otherwise the candidate 
will be invalidated.    
    d.  E4/5/6 candidates who reach High Year Tenure (HYT) on or after 1 July 
2014 or who have received a HYT waiver to remain in a SELRES status on or 
after 1 July 2014, are eligible to participate in the advancement 
examination, per ref (c).  Personnel who exceed the HYT limit for the next 
paygrade do not meet the criteria to serve in the next paygrade vacancy and 
therefore are not eligible for advancement and shall not be administered an 
examination.
    e.  E7 candidates who reach HYT on or after 1 September 2014, or who have 
received a HYT waiver prior to the board convening date to remain on active-
duty (or remain in SELRES status) beyond
1 September 2014 are eligible for consideration by the selection board.  
Candidates with a HYT date prior to 1 September 2014 are not eligible to 
compete for advancement and shall not be administered an examination unless 
they have an approved HYT waiver and have been validated by their command 
prior to the board convening date.
    f.  Candidates who have submitted a formal written request for voluntary 
transfer to the retired reserve (with or without pay) or fleet reserve on a 
date prior to their mandated HYT are ineligible for advancement.
    g.  Members who were validated as selection board eligible (SBE) and have 
submitted a request for voluntary transfer to the retired reserve (with or 
without pay) or fleet reserve may regain selection board eligibility provided 
cancellation of retirement/fleet reserve authorization is approved at Navy 
Personnel Command (NPC) prior to selection board convening date.  Otherwise, 
they are ineligible for consideration by the chief petty officer (CPO) 
selection board.  
Commands must revalidate members whose cancellation of retirement/fleet 
reserve authorization is approved prior to selection board convening date by 
encrypted e-mail to NETPDTC (N321), info copy to PERS-812/802 at 
advancements-reserve(at)navy.mil prior to convening of board.  The encrypted 
e-mail must include reason for revalidation.
    h.  Commissioning programs:  Sailors who have been selected for Seaman to 
Admiral (STA-21), Medical Enlisted Commissioning Program, and Medical Service 
Corps In-service Procurement Programs remain eligible for advancement to CPO.  
Selection to any other officer commissioning program renders the member 
ineligible and examinations that were administered in error must be 
invalidated by their command.  
    i.  Warfare qualification requirements for E6 candidates are contained in 
the applicable OPNAV Instruction 1414 series and should be reviewed when 
verifying advancement eligibility.
    j.  Candidates must meet special requirements (citizenship, medical, 
armed services vocational aptitude battery test) for certain ratings outlined 
in ref (b), paragraph 204 no later than 31 January 2014.
    k.  Security clearance:  All personnel in certain ratings must, at a 
minimum, maintain continuous security clearance eligibility.  
Favorable investigation adjudication must be issued from Department of 
Defense Central Adjudication Facility or the member's CO must grant temporary 
access (an interim clearance) prior to 31 January 2014.  COs must follow 
procedures from the Navy personnel security program to grant interim access.  
In accordance with ref (d), Sailors with an expired or expiring security 
clearance who have proper access and have maintained security clearance 
eligibility may participate in this examination cycle.  Sailors in the 
following ratings who do not meet this requirement are ineligible for 
advancement and shall not be administered an examination:  AC, AE, AG, AO, 
ATI, ATO, AWF, AWO, AWR, AWS, AZ, CTI, CTN, CTR, CTT, EOD, ET, FC, GM, HT, 
IC, IS, IT, LN, MA, MC, MN, ND, OS, QM, SB, SO, STG, STS, and YN.  This 
guidance supersedes chapter 2 of ref (b).
    l.  Candidates must meet physical readiness program requirements of ref 
(e). 
    m.  "A" school candidates:
        (1) Sailors who have reported to "A" school for a rating conversion 
and have not graduated from the "A" school by 31 January
2014 are not eligible to participate in the examination.
        (2)  Sailors graduating from mandatory "A" school for the rating 
entry after the regular examination month are not eligible for regular or 
late examinations in their new rating.
    n.  Branch class (BRCL) and special program indicator (SPI)
Code:  BRCL 32 with a blank "SPI" code is an invalid Navy accounting status 
which may cause Sailors to be reflected in the incorrect advancement 
competitive category.  Commands with Sailors in this invalid accounting 
status must take action to correct this error either via Navy Standard 
Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) corrective action or the Sailor must 
submit a Board for Correction of Naval Records petition.  This accounting 
status is reflected on the command's Enlisted Distribution Verification 
Report.  Sailors in this invalid accounting status will have their 
examination invalidated.  Candidates who are invalidated for this reason and 
do not have the corrections completed prior to the board convening date may 
not be eligible for a special selection board.
    o.  Special requirements for Navy diver (ND) personnel:  To be eligible 
for advancement to E7, Sailors must hold the first class diver navy enlisted 
classification (NEC) 5342 prior to the E7 board convening date.  It is the 
command's responsibility to invalidate examination results for those SBE 
Sailors that fail to hold the NEC
5342 as outlined. 
    p.  Special requirements for explosive ordnance disposal (EOD)
personnel: To be eligible for advancement to E7, Sailors must hold the senior 
EOD technician NEC 5335 or the master EOD technician NEC 5337.  It is the 
command's responsibility to invalidate examination results for those SBE 
Sailors that fail to hold the NEC 5335 and NEC
5337 as outlined.
    q.  The in-theater SBE waiver is not an automatic process.
        (1) Commands must take action to validate as SBE those eligible for 
the in-theater SBE waiver.  Command failure to validate as SBE prior to the 
board convening date will result in the member not being considered by the 
selection board.
        (2) Validation process.  Prepare and submit a transmittal letter with 
Encl (1) as the listing by activity and Encl (2) as candidate worksheets.  
Submit SBE waiver transmittal letter separately from examination answer 
sheets.  Deadline for requesting SBE waiver is 15 April 2014.
        (3) Candidates are directed to verify that they have been validated 
as SBE by viewing their profile sheet via NKO at https://wwwa.nko.navy.mil. 
(Refer to paragraph 8.e. of this
NAVADMIN.)
        (4) NETPDTC SBE waiver POCS are Mr. Bruce Dietly at 
bruce.dietly(at)navy.mil or Ms. Jennifer Spohn at jennifer.
spohn(at)navy.mil or by phone at (850) 473-6148/DSN 753.

4.  Performance mark average (PMA):  Evaluations used to compute PMA must be 
inclusive of the periods listed below:  
    Prospective    Evaluation    Computation
    Paygrade       Paygrade      Period
    E4             E3            1 June 2013 to 31 January 2014
    E5             E4            1 February 2013 to 31 January 2014
    E6             E5            1 February 2011 to 31 January 2014
    E7             E6            1 February 2011 to 31 December 2013
When recommending candidates for advancement, commands must verify candidates 
have an evaluation in current paygrade to establish a PMA.
Refer to ref (f) for use of concurrent evaluations for specific individual 
augmentees (IA) and operation support assignment (OSA) tours for PMA 
computation and for use to establish eligibility for EP TIR waivers.  IA/OSA 
concurrent evaluations used for TIR waivers must have an ending date by 31 
January 2014.  If a service member does not have an evaluation within the 
period specified, prepare a special evaluation with block 15 reflecting 31 
January 2014 for E4, E5, and E6 candidates; 31 December 2013 for E7 
candidates.

5.  General examination info: 
    a.  Ensure all candidates, ESOs, proctors, and administrators have 
required clearance prior to examination administration.
    b.  Examinations will be administered per Chapter 6 of ref (b), this 
NAVADMIN, and the general examination verbatim instruction.  Do not 
administer any Cycle 094 examinations prior to 1 February 2014 unless 
specifically authorized by COMNAVPERSCOM (PER-812) or under the provisions of 
ref (a).
    c.  Points for off-duty education for E4/5/6 candidates:  Sailors will be 
awarded two points for an accredited associate's degree and four points for 
an accredited baccalaureate degree or above.  
Education points will be awarded for the highest degree held.  To allow 
sufficient time for the Navy college center to process all documents, 
transcripts for Sailors must be received by the Navy college center no later 
than 15 January 2014.  The Navy college center will validate the transcript 
and enter education data into the Navy college management information system 
(NCMIS).  The NCMIS value will be used in the final multiple score 
calculation.  When calculating award points locally, do not include degree 
award points in that calculation.
    d.  For ratings with multiple examinations, it is imperative that ESOs 
ensure proper examination identification is used during examination ordering 
and answer sheet verification (i.e., ATI/ATO, ET/ETR/ETV, MM/MME/MMW).  
Incorrect examination identification will cause examinations to be 
incorrectly graded.
    e. Aviation electronics technician (AT) examinations:  Administer ATI 
examinations for intermediate maintenance personnel and ATO examinations for 
organizational maintenance personnel.  To ensure the best possible candidates 
are selected for CPO, beginning with the Cycle 222 FY-15 E7 selection board, 
ATI and ATO board eligible personnel will be merged into one selection pool.  
Personnel will continue to be tested via two separate exams.
    f.  Examinations for recalled reservists will be ordered by the command 
holding the member's service record.  Authority is granted to administer 
examinations to SELRES candidates on active-duty concurrently with their 
regular Navy counterparts on 23 January 2014 for E7, 6 March 2014 for E6, 13 
March 2014 for E5 and 20 March 2014 for E4.  However, these SELRES candidates 
are still required to take the Cycle 094 reserve examination and not the 
active-duty Cycle 222 or 223 examinations.
    g.  The examination answer sheet form has been updated to reflect the 
newly structured 175-question examination format, and replaces the social 
security number (SSN) with the Department of Defense Identification Number 
(DOD ID).  The new form, NETPDTC
1430/2 (Rev 3-2013), can easily be identified by its green color.  
Destroy all red examination answer sheets, NETPDTC 1430/2(Rev 9-2000).  Block 
4 of the examination answer sheet should be filled in with 094 as the cycle. 
    h.  Rating entry for non-designated personnel must be approved by PERS-
812.  Non-designated members who require an "A" school waiver for advancement 
examination participation must submit a request to PERS-812 postmarked by 31 
December 2013.
    i.  Requests to administer examinations late must be held to a minimum to 
allow time for adequate processing and quota determination.  Submit requests 
to administer examinations late per paragraph 605.d. of ref (b) via message 
or encrypted e-mail to NETPDTC (N321).  Requests are to include member's 
name, rate, DOD-ID number, and justification for missing regular examination.  
No action will be taken on requests received without justification.  Ensure 
"Admin Error" and "Operational Commitment" are clarified when used as 
justification.  Requests received by NETPDTC after 7 March 2014 will be 
disapproved.  Examinations administered late must be administered NLT 31 
March 2014 or within seven days of receipt.  
When a candidate justifiably misses a regular examination and an examination 
is at the command, do not destroy examination.  Submit a request as described 
above for permission to retain the examination for late administration.  
    j.  If an examination is administered in error, the command must request 
to invalidate it per paragraph 610 of ref (b). 

6.  Forwarding examination returns.  Submit examination answer sheets by 
close of business the day after administration of the examination.  
Expeditious submission is required; grading cannot commence until the 
majority of examinations are received.  Mail enlisted advancement examination 
answer sheet packages via a traceable method to: 
    COMMANDING OFFICER
    NETPDTC (N321)
    BLDG 2435 RM 1167
    6490 SAUFLEY FIELD ROAD
    PENSACOLA, FL  32509-5240
Per ref (b), paragraph 611.a. and ref (a), package the original transmittal 
letter, answer sheets and enclosures in an envelope using a cardboard 
stiffener.  Do not seal the envelope with excessive tape and do not fold, 
staple, spindle, cut, or mutilate answer sheets.  Do not send packing lists 
or letters of destruction (maintain at command per ref (b), paragraph 
612.a.). Do not send worksheets (except for IA and SBE waiver candidates).  
Mail in the following manner:
    a.  CONUS installations.  Send examination answer sheets via FedEx under 
the current GSA contract.  Retain a proof of delivery tracking number.  FedEx 
may be tracked at www.fedex.com/us.
    b.  Overseas shore commands.  Send examination answer sheets via FedEx or 
United States Postal Service (USPS) three-day express mail service.  Retain a 
proof of delivery with FedEx or a return receipt 
with USPS.  Express mail may be tracked at www.usps.com.    
    c.  Deployed ships.  Send examination answer sheets in registered mail 
working bag addressed to the servicing fleet mail center in the deployed 
area.  The third line of the address should read "ADVANCEMENT EXAMINATION 
ANSWER SHEETS ENCLOSED - DO NOT OPEN IN THE MAILROOM".  The Postal Officer 
will then forward via USPS three-day express mail to NETPDTC.
    d.  Do not mix cycles together when returning answer sheets.  
Separate each cycle and mail individually.
    e.  Commands shall verify receipt of examination answer sheets by NETPDTC 
on the NEAS website's electronic tote board located at 
https://neasos.cnet.navy.mil/neas/public/toteboard.aspx.

7.  Examination discrepancies:  A detailed discrepancy list will be 
maintained at the NEAS website for ESOs and authorized viewers.  
Resolve examination discrepancies in accordance with ref (b), table 7-3, via 
letter or encrypted e-mail with attachments to 
sfly_n321_discrepanc(at)navy.mil.  Ensure NSIPS is correct prior to 
submitting requests for correction.  

8.  Examination results:  Examination results will be posted on the NEAS 
website and may be accessed by registered users.
    a.  The examination status verification report (ESVR) is the official 
source for the results.  This report must be verified for accuracy prior to 
frocking and advancement.  Confirmation of a candidate's selection board 
status will be indicated on the candidate's profile sheet or the ESVR. 
        (1) Commands must submit a message to NETPDTC Pensacola, FL (N321), 
info COMNAVPERSCOM Millington, TN (PERS-812), requesting invalidation for 
candidates no longer eligible or no longer recommended for advancement.
        (2) Withdrawal of advancement recommendation must be documented in 
accordance with ref (b), paragraph 721.b.
    a.  Commands will be notified via Naval message if a candidate's 
examination is invalidated due to unusual circumstances.  All other 
invalidation notifications will be through ESVR for accuracy and profile 
sheets.  Contact NETPDTC by phone or encrypted e-mail for clarification of 
invalidations. 
    c.  Commands are directed to verify the ESVR for accuracy and re-verify 
weekly thereafter until scheduled board convening date.  
If necessary, take corrective actions per ref (b) to ensure candidates who 
qualify for selection board consideration are designated as SBE prior to the 
board convening date.
    d.  Rate change authorizations, profile sheets, and command statistic 
reports are available at the NEAS website.
    e.  Individual Sailors may view/download their profile sheet at the 
"Profile Sheets" link on the NKO Navy Advancement Center website.  Log onto 
Navy NKO at https://wwwa.nko.navy.mil and follow the Navy CAC link under 
career management.  
    f.  As noted in paragraph 102 of ref (b), candidates share equal 
responsibility with their parent commands in ensuring their name appears on 
the selection board eligibility list.  After exhausting local resources, if 
the candidate's name still does not appear on the eligibility list, contact 
PERS-802 prior to board convening.  
Failure to do so may affect approval of special selection board requests.  
The FY-15 reserve selection board will convene 19 May 2014.

9.  Communication with the selection board.  Candidates' letter to board 
(LTB), which may be mailed or e-mailed to the addresses below, provides 
candidates the opportunity to submit any missing documents from the sections 
of their records that are viewed by the selection boards.  Candidates are 
encouraged to review ref (b), chapter 12 and ref (g) concerning selection 
board record review and guidance for LTB submission.  Selection boards will 
review the OMPF and performance summary record (PSR) Parts I, II, and III of 
all candidates, as well as items submitted by candidates per policy outlined 
in this NAVADMIN.  A LTB is only recommended if the candidate's OMPF is 
missing information, their PSR reflects incorrect data, or they have 
information they desire to convey to the board.  Candidates are not required 
to submit a LTB to notify the board that everything is correct in their 
record.  Candidates are encouraged to access their OMPF via BUPERS online to 
verify completeness.  Candidates may also request a copy of their OMPF as 
outlined in ref (h).  In many cases, items viewable in NSIPS electronic 
service record (ESR) may not be contained in a candidate's OMPF.  Therefore 
if documents that candidates want the board to review are not viewable via 
"OMPF My Record", they may submit those documents with their LTB.  Further 
LTB submission guidance is as follows: 
    a.  Communication to the board must originate from the individual member 
and must be accompanied under the candidate's LTB.  Information received that 
is not under the candidate's LTB (third party correspondence) or not received 
by the NPC customer service center (CSC) by the established deadline will not 
be presented to the board.  The time and date LTBs are received in the NPC 
CSC inbox is the time and date used for deadline verification (Central 
Standard Time).  LTBs must be received by NPC CSC by 28 April 2014.  Although 
a late LTB may be accepted by the NPC CSC, it will not be presented to the 
board.  This supersedes ref (b).
    b.  All mailed LTBs must be on plain white paper, paper clipped (no 
staples, binders, folders, or tabs), and submitted under cover letter to the 
president of the board.  Candidates must verify the correct board number (see 
below) is on their LTB to ensure it appears before the proper board. 
    c.  Full name and full SSN must be affixed and legible on all documents 
submitted.                                                 
    d.  Selection board mailing addresses.  Use of special handling mail 
(certified or registered) is not advised due to significant delays in 
handling.

    e.  E-mail address for submitting a LTB is cscselboard(at)navy.mil.E-
mailed LTBs must be encrypted to protect personally identifiable information.  
Trouble with file encryption or certificate issues does not justify a late 
LTB.  If the candidate is unable to send the e-mail encrypted to 
cscselboard(at)navy.mil, candidates may utilize the safe access file exchange 
(SAFE) website at https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/safe/ to transmit their LTB.  
In order for LTBs to be considered by the board, the NPC CSC must receive the 
e-mail notification of the file upload from SAFE before the deadline.  There 
may be a delay for the SAFE web site to notify NPC CSC of file upload.  
Therefore, candidates are highly encouraged to submit their LTB early.  
    f.  Candidates are authorized to submit more than one LTB, vice waiting 
until the deadline to submit one all-inclusive LTB.  LTBs forwarded for 
consideration by the selection boards will not be added to the candidate's 
OMPF, except for award citations accurately reflected in the Navy department 
awards services (NDAWS) website, per ref (i).

10.  Selection board official results will be announced via NAVADMIN.
