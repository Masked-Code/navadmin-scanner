SUBJ/CPO BIRTHDAY MESSAGE// 
 
RMKS/1. Today is a time of reflection. As you go about your day, we 
ask that all of you wearing anchors contemplate and reflect upon 
yourself as a leader, a Sailor, and as a person. Our Navy depends on 
you to ensure that our Sailors are prepared to fight and win when 
challenged. The tone of your command and the tone on the deck plate 
is established by your actions and the standards you set and adhere 
to. You create a culture that breeds warfighting, professionalism, 
and positivity. You should always ask yourself, "Are your Sailors 
ready?" Are they prepared in mind, body, and spirit? Are you 
preparing our future leaders to answer our nation's call? Are you 
ready? 
 
2. You are humble servants to our great Nation, our Navy, and your 
Sailors. You are the driving force that creates and empowers great 
people, great leaders, and great teams. You are relied upon to 
always be forward leaning, anticipate problems before they occur, 
and pivot at a moment's notice. Today is no different. 
 
3. Today is a day for renewed dedication; to grade yourself, to 
correct weaknesses and build upon your strengths. Today of all days 
is the time to assess your technical skills, qualifications, 
foresight, and preparedness. It is critical to be honest with 
yourself both professionally and personally. Ask yourself if you are 
doing everything you need to be doing to self-assess, hold yourself 
accountable, and hold yourselves accountable as a collective Mess. 
 
4. As you don your anchors today, take time to reflect on the 131 
years of the privilege to serve. Take a brief moment to celebrate 
the enduring legacy of Chief Petty Officers and those that have gone 
before you, then get back to the deck plate and do what you all do 
best - lead. 
 
5. Released by ADM L. M. Franchetti, Chief of Naval Operations and 
MCPON J. Honea, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy.
