SUBJ/FY-17-2 TEST PILOT SCHOOL SELECTION BOARD//

REF/A/DOC/BUPERS/5OCT10//
AMPN/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1500.62B, TEST PILOT SCHOOLS.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces convening of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot 
School (USNTPS) selection board on 20 July 2016.  This board will select 
highly qualified Naval Aviators and naval flight officers (NFO) for USNTPS.  
In particular, NFO applicants are in high demand.  Request command and fleet 
community assistance to identify candidates with strong operational 
performance and, ideally, strong academic backgrounds in science, technology, 
engineering, and math (STEM) fields of study.  USNTPS graduates have 
significant and long-lasting influence on platforms and systems, and thus 
directly impact the future warfighting capability of their fleet community.  
The Naval Postgraduate School/USNTPS cooperative program will not be offered 
during this board or in the near future.

2.  To be eligible for board consideration, a command-endorsed application 
per reference (a) must be received by Navy Personnel Command (NPC) Customer 
Service Center (CSC) no later than 17 June 2016.  Additional documentation 
will be accepted until 18 July 2016. The command endorsement shall address 
whether the applicant, if selected, will be allowed and available to report 
for initial training as early as October 2016.  The Service Member's e-mail 
address(es), phone number(s), college transcripts, and post-USNTPS test 
squadron assignment preferences must be included with the application.  It is 
highly recommended that applicants provide an official photograph in current 
rank if not already in their permanent service record.  Information on 
updating photographs and other record items can be found at
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/Pages/default2.aspx.

officers (O-2 or O-3) with detailer-forecasted career timing to complete the 
selected USNTPS program and a 24-36-month follow-on test tour prior to their 
expected department head tour.  If there are not enough qualified junior 
officers to meet requirements, lieutenant commanders with exceptional records 
may be selected, provided they can meet applicable career milestones.
    c.  Aerospace engineering duty officer (1510) aviators through the grade 
of lieutenant commander may be selected if they are able to serve a 24-36-
month follow-on test tour and still meet career milestones.
