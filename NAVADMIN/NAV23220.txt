SUBJ/SUICIDE PREVENTION MONTH// 
 
RMKS/1.  September is Suicide Prevention Month.  This year, the 
Department of Defense's theme is "Connect to Protect; Support is 
within Reach," which highlights the value of unit connectedness as a 
key protective factor in suicide prevention.  Suicide Prevention is 
an All Hands effort.  We must dedicate ourselves to fostering 
supportive environments where Service Members feel connected with 
one another, seek help without fear, and can readily access mental 
health resources when needed. 
 
2.  To prevent suicide, it is critical that every Navy unit has a 
command-wide climate built on trust and respect, with high 
protective factors and low risk factors, where the stigma for 
seeking help does not exist.  NAVADMIN 139/23, "Revisions to Command 
Climate Assessments," and its supporting fact sheet provide guidance 
for the 2023 Command Climate Assessment Annual Fielding Window, 
emphasizing the importance of building the protective factors of 
connectedness and inclusion, while targeting recognized risk factors 
of moderate and high stress; workplace hostility; and the presence 
of harassing behaviors (both racial and sexual).  The fact sheet 
provides manners and methods for doing so. 
 
3.  A healthy command climate that promotes high morale and 
significantly reduces stress should be an essential part of every 
unit's suicide prevention program.  Suicide prevention should be 
part of a command's daily business, and every member of our Navy 
team should be prepared to recognize warning signs and provide our 
people the help and care they need. 
    a.  The Mental Health Playbook (V1.1) offers guidance on how to 
have effective conversations that promote trust and create a sense 
of connectedness.

6JZs35TCd2ZQ%3d%3d b.  If you believe that a shipmate is experiencing 
suicidal thoughts, remember to ACT - Ask, Care, Treat. 
        (1) Ask - Ask your shipmate directly "are you thinking about 
killing yourself?  Do you have a plan to kill yourself?" 
        (2) Care - Tell your shipmate that you're concerned about 
them, without judgment. 
        (3) Treat - Take your shipmate to get help immediately and 
stay with your shipmate until they are directly connected with 
immediate care. 
    c.  Service Members within the Continental United States (CONUS) 
experiencing suicidal ideation should call the Veterans Crisis Line 
at 988 and press 1, or go directly to the nearest emergency room. 
    d.  Service Members outside the Continental United States 
(OCONUS) experiencing suicidal ideation should call Europe: 
00800 1273 8255 or DSN 118, Korea:  080-855-5118 or DSN 118, 
Philippines:  Dial #MYVA or 02-8550-3888 and press 7.  For all other 
locations, reach out via the Veterans Crisis Line by following the 
country code dialing procedures to call the CONUS 800 number (1-800- 
273-8225 and press 1).  Alternatively, Service Members can open a 
chat at https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/get-help-now/chat/ and 
request a phone call from the crisis line responder who will call 
them at any OCONUS location, or follow local procedures to access 
emergency care. 
 
4.  The majority of Sailors and family members who die by suicide 
use personal firearms to take their lives.  Consistently storing 
personal firearms in a gun safe or with a gun lock, and separate 
from ammunition is critical to preventing a Service Member or family 
member from taking an impulsive, highly lethal action. 
    a.  More than 413,400 gun locks have been distributed Navy-wide 
since 2020 and are available free of charge at all Fleet and Family 
Service Centers and Navy Reserve Centers. 
    b.  For more information, posters and products on Lethal Means 
Safety see  
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/Culture-Resilience/Suicide-
Prevention/Products-Resources/. 
 
5.  Numerous resources are available for commands, Service Members 
and their families. 
    a.  Access to mental health care is a key protective factor in 
suicide prevention.  Refer to the mental health care roadmap on the 
back of the Mental Health Playbook for resources on access to care. 
Additionally, NAVADMIN 166/23, "Self-Initiated Referral Process for 
Mental Health Evaluations of Service Members" was issued in July 
2023.  This policy can be found at: 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/References/Messages/NAVADMIN-2023/. 
    b.  Chaplains are also a significant part of our continuum of 
care.  Chaplains offer a uniquely protected confidentiality to our 
Sailors that makes them a safe place to start seeking care.  If you 
or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or 
feelings, you can reach out to a chaplain. 
   c.  The Project 1 Small Act (P1SA) campaign provides a toolkit of 
suicide prevention activities, not just for Suicide Prevention month 
but for use year round.  A recently updated Suicide Prevention 
Handbook and General Military Training products are also available 
on the website at:  https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/Culture-
Resilience/Suicide-Prevention/Products-Resources/  
   d.  Sailor Assistance and Intercept for Life (SAIL) is an 
evidence-informed intervention program that assigns a case worker to 
provide rapid assistance, ongoing risk assessment, care 
coordination, and reintegration assistance to Active Duty Sailors 
who experience a suicide ideation or attempt. 
 
6.  The point of contact for Navy specific suicide prevention 
questions is the Navy Culture and Force Resilience Office via e-mail 
at suicideprevention@navy.mil.
