RMKS/1.  To improve readiness and reduce turnover of our Forward Deployed 
Naval Force (FDNF) sea duty units, in line with reference (a), effective 
immediately first-term Sailors assigned to sea duty billets in Japan, Guam, 
and Spain will be assigned to longer tour lengths.  Tour lengths will reflect 
the Prescribed Sea Tour (PST) up to a maximum of 48 months accompanied and 48 
months unaccompanied.
The tour length exceptions in exhibit (1) of reference (b) are still valid 
and in effect.

2.  In the event the dependents of a member are not given command 
sponsorship, a maximum of 24 months unaccompanied orders will be issued.

3.  This change only impacts orders issued after the date of reference (a) 
and is only for first-term enlisted Sailors assigned to their first sea duty 
tour in Japan, Guam, and Spain.  It does not apply to enlisted Sailors 
assigned to sea duty on their second, third, fourth, or subsequent tour.

4.  For Sailors currently assigned to a sea duty tour in Japan, Guam, and 
Spain (including First-term Sailors), reference (c) remains in effect and 
these Sailors are encouraged to take advantage of the incentives offered to 
extend their tours.

5.  For First-term Sailors affected by reference (a) and who are assigned 48 
month tours, the incentives offered in reference (c) do not apply.  However, 
these Sailors will have any remaining PST from their first sea duty tour 
waived.  Sailors will only become eligible for Overseas Tour Enlisted 
Incentive Program after completion of their initial assigned tour.

6.  Supplemental guidance is available via the Navy Personnel Command (NPC) 
website.  Questions concerning this message should be referred to the NPC 
Customer Service Center at 1-(866)-U-ASK-NPC/ (866)827-5672, or via e-mail at 
cscmailbox(at)navy.mil.
