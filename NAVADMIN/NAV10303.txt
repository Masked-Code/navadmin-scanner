SUBJ/OBSERVANCE OF HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 2010// 

RMKS/1.  NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH WILL BE OBSERVED FROM 15 
SEPTEMBER - 15 OCTOBER 2010.  THE THEME FOR THIS YEAR'S OBSERVANCE IS 
"HERITAGE, DIVERSITY, INTEGRITY, AND HONOR:  THE RENEWED HOPE OF 
AMERICA."

2.  IN SEPTEMBER 1968, CONGRESS AUTHORIZED PRESIDENT LYNDON B.
JOHNSON TO PROCLAIM A NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE WEEK.  TWENTY YEARS 
LATER, THE OBSERVANCE WAS EXPANDED BY CONGRESS TO A MONTH-LONG 
COMMEMORATION TO CELEBRATE THE CULTURE AND TRADITIONS OF THOSE WHO 
TRACE THEIR ROOTS TO SPAIN, MEXICO, AND THE SPANISH-SPEAKING NATIONS OF 
CENTRAL AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA, AND THE CARIBBEAN.  SEPTEMBER 15 WAS 
CHOSEN AS THE STARTING POINT OF THE COMMEMORATION BECAUSE IT IS THE 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE FIVE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES OF 
COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, AND NICARAGUA.  MEXICO 
AND CHILE CELEBRATE THEIR INDEPENDENCE DAYS ON SEPTEMBER 16 AND 18, 
RESPECTIVELY.

DIVERSITY OF OUR PEOPLE.  WITH A POPULATION OF MORE THAN 48 MILLION,

PERCENT OF THE NATION'S POPULATION AND 24 PERCENT OF OUR COUNTRY'S 
WORKFORCE.

4.  TODAY, MORE THAN 63,000 HISPANIC OR LATINO SAILORS AND CIVILIANS 
SERVE HONORABLY IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY.  EVERY DAY, AND IN EVERY 
FACET OF NAVAL OPERATIONS, THESE TALENTED PROFESSIONALS OF OUR TOTAL 
FORCE WORK, SERVE, AND SACRIFICE FOR OUR NATION AND FELLOW CITIZENS.
EACH BRINGS UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIENCES TO OUR NAVY, ENHANCING 
OUR CULTURE AND IMPROVING OUR MISSION READINESS.
