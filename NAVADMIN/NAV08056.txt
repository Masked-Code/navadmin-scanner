TITLE 10 OF THE UNITED STATES CODE OUTLINES THE ROLE OF ARMED FORCES IN 
THE UNITED STATES CODE.// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN CLARIFIES THE RULES GOVERNING MANAGEMENT OF THE 
RESERVE COMPONENT (RC) PERSONNEL MEDICAL HOLD (MEDHOLD) SCREENING AND 
ASSIGNMENT PROGRAM.
2.  FOLLOWING THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE NAVY GREATLY 
INCREASED THE NUMBER OF RC SAILORS ON ACTIVE DUTY.  AS A RESULT, WE SAW 
AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF RC SAILORS INCURRING/AGGRAVATING INJURIES 
OR ILLNESSES WHILE ON ACTIVE DUTY.  IN TURN, THIS HAS LED TO A LARGER 
NUMBER OF RC SAILORS RETAINED ON ACTIVE DUTY IN MEDHOLD FOR MEDICAL 
EVALUATION (MEDEVAL) AND TREATMENT (REFS A THROUGH E APPLY).
3.  COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-95) IS THE BENEFITS ISSUING AUTHORITY (BIA) FOR 
THE NAVY RC MEDHOLD PROGRAM DESCRIBED IN REF A.
4.  MEDHOLD IS A SHORT-TERM MEDICAL TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR RESERVE 
COMPONENT SAILORS TO ADDRESS CONDITIONS INCURRED OR AGGRAVATED DURING 
PERIODS OF ACTIVE DUTY OF 30 DAYS OR MORE.  EVIDENCE MUST EXIST IN THE 
MEDICAL RECORD THAT A CONDITION WAS IDENTIFIED AND DOCUMENTED WHILE THE 
SAILOR WAS ON ACTIVE DUTY ORDERS OF 30 DAYS OR MORE.  IAW REF A, AND 
WITH THE MEMBER’S CONSENT, MEMBERS MAY THEN BE ORDERED TO, OR CONTINUED 
ON, ACTIVE DUTY TO COMPLETE FURTHER MEDICAL EVALUATION (MEDEVAL) AND TO 
RECEIVE AUTHORIZED MEDICAL CARE UNDER THE MEDHOLD PROGRAM.
5.  PERSONNEL WILL BE LIMITED TO A TOTAL OF 12 MONTHS ON MEDHOLD IN 
PERIODS NO GREATER THAN SIX MONTHS.  PERIODS EXCEEDING 12 MONTHS IN 
TOTAL DURATION REQUIRE COMNAVPERSCOM APPROVAL AND WILL BE APPROVED ON A 
CASE-BY-CASE BASIS IF THE MEDICAL CONDITION WILL BE RESOLVED DURING AN 
ADDITIONAL SIX MONTH MEDHOLD PERIOD.  OTHERWISE, IAW REF B THE CASE 
WILL BE ENTERED INTO THE DISABILITY EVALUATION SYSTEM (DES) AND THE 
SAILOR WILL BE REFERRED TO THE PHYSICAL EVALUATION BOARD (PEB) FOR 
DETERMINATION OF FITNESS TO CONTINUE NAVAL SERVICE, ENTITLEMENT TO 
BENEFITS, DISABILITY RATINGS, AND DISPOSITION OF THE SERVICE MEMBER.
6.  THE MERE EXISTENCE OF AN ILLNESS, INJURY OR DISEASE DOES NOT 
NECESSARILY QUALIFY A SAILOR FOR MEDHOLD.  THE CONDITION MUST RESULT IN 
THE SAILOR NOT FIT FOR DUTY.  SAILORS FOUND FIT FOR DUTY, IAW REF A, 
WHO REQUIRE MEDICAL CARE FOR A MINOR OR CHRONIC CONDITION MAY BE 
RELEASED FROM MEDHOLD.  CONTINUED TREATMENT FOR SUCH CONDITIONS MAY BE 
MANAGED USING THE SAILORS VETERAN AFFAIRS (VA) OR TRICARE BENEFITS, OR 
THE LINE OF DUTY (LOD) BENEFITS PROGRAM DESCRIBED IN REF A.
7.  PROCEDURES:
    A.  THE BIA SHALL PLACE A SERVICE MEMBER WITH AN IDENTIFIED INJURY 
OR ILLNESS ON MEDEVAL ORDERS FOR UP TO 30 DAYS FOR FURTHER MEDEVAL AND 
TREATMENT, WITH THE GOAL TO RETURN THE SAILOR TO FIT FOR DUTY STATUS, 
AND RELEASE FROM ACTIVE DUTY OR AVAILABLE FOR REASSIGNMENT.  AT ANY 
TIME DURING THE MEDEVAL PERIOD, THE TREATING PROVIDER MAY RECOMMEND TO 
PERS-95 THAT THE SAILOR IS FIT FOR DUTY, OR IS UNFIT FOR DUTY AND 
REQUIRES FURTHER MEDICAL CARE.  ONE OF THE FOLLOWING COURSES OF ACTION 
SHALL BE TAKEN:
        (1) IF FIT FOR DUTY, THE SAILOR SHALL BE IMMEDIATELY CLEARED 
AND RETURNED TO A DUTY STATUS FOR COMPLETION OF ACTIVE DUTY ORDERS, 
REASSIGNMENT, OR PROCESSING FOR RELEASE FROM ACTIVE DUTY.
        (2) IF UNFIT FOR DUTY, THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS SHALL BE TAKEN:
            (A) THE TREATING PROVIDER SHALL COMPLETE A NAVMED 6100/5, 
ABBREVIATED MEDICAL EVALUATION BOARD REPORT (AMEBR) PER REF E.
            (B) THE MEDICAL BOARD CONVENING AUTHORITY AT THE MEDICAL 
TREATMENT FACILITY (MTF) SHALL REVIEW AND APPROVE THE AMEBR.
            (C) THE MTF SHALL MAKE THE APPROPRIATE ENTRY INTO THE

            (D) THE MTF SHALL FORWARD THE AMEBR TO PERS-95.

PLACING THE SAILOR IN THE MEDHOLD PROGRAM.
            (F) PERS-95 SHALL DIRECT PERS-4G TO INITIATE RC MEDHOLD 
ORDERS UNDER AUTHORITY OF SECTION 12301 (H) OF REF F.  AS STATED IN

            (G) PERS-95 SHALL DIRECT PERS-4G TO ASSIGN OR TRANSFER THE 
SAILOR TO A COMMAND FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT, WITH THE GOAL OF 
CONTINUED TREATMENT UNTIL THE SAILOR IS RETURNED TO ACTIVE DUTY, 
RELEASED FROM ACTIVE DUTY, OR UNTIL FINAL DISPOSITION IS DETERMINED BY 
THE PEB PER REF B.
    B.  TRANSFER OF SAILOR:  AT ANY TIME DURING THE MEDHOLD PERIOD,
PERS-95 MAY DIRECT THE TRANSFER OF THE SAILOR TO THE MOST APPROPRIATE 
COMMAND FOR MEDICAL CARE.  SAILORS TRANSFERRED OUTSIDE THE GEOGRAPHICAL 
AREA OF AN MTF SHALL HAVE A COMPLETED AMEBR AND UPDATED RECORD ENTRY 
INTO MEDBOLTT BY THE INITIATING MTF PRIOR TO TRANSFER.
    C.  RELEASE FROM MEDHOLD:  THE TREATING PROVIDER MAY RECOMMEND THE 
RELEASE OF A PATIENT FROM MEDHOLD AT ANY CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE TIME 
DURING MEDHOLD.  THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS SHALL BE TAKEN:
        (1) THE TREATING PROVIDER SHALL MAKE THE APPROPRIATE ENTRY INTO 
THE SAILORS MEDICAL RECORD AND COMPLETE NAVMED 6100/6, RETURN OF A 
PATIENT TO MEDICALLY UNRESTRICTED DUTY.
        (2) THE MTF SHALL NOTIFY PERS-95 AND FORWARD A COPY OF THE

        (3) UPON REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THE RECOMMENDATION, THE
PERS-95 SENIOR MEDICAL OFFICER (SMO) AND/OR THE MEDICAL STATUS REVIEW 
OFFICER (MSRO) SHALL RELEASE THE SAILOR FROM ACTIVE DUTY STATUS PER REF 
A.
    D.  SECOND MEDHOLD PERIODS:  AT ANY TIME DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTH 
MEDHOLD PERIOD, IF THE TREATING PROVIDER DETERMINES THE SAILOR WILL 
LIKELY NOT BE FOUND FIT FOR DUTY DURING THE FIRST PERIOD OF MEDHOLD, 
BUT WILL LIKELY BE FOUND FIT FOR DUTY DURING A SECOND PERIOD OF MEDHOLD, 
THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS SHALL BE TAKEN:
        (1) THE PROVIDER SHALL REQUEST A SECOND PERIOD OF MEDHOLD BY 
COMPLETING THE STEPS IN PARA 7A (2), (A) THROUGH (E) ABOVE.
        (2) REQUESTS SHALL BE FORWARDED TO PERS-95 NLT 60 DAYS IN 
ADVANCE OF THE END OF THE FIRST PERIOD OF MEDHOLD TO AVOID A LAPSE IN 
THE MEMBERS PAY AND BENEFITS.
        (3) UPON REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THE AMEBR, PERS-95 SHALL DIRECT 
PERS-4G TO MODIFY THE INITIAL MEDHOLD ORDERS TO EXTEND THE SAILOR ON

MONTH PERIOD OF MEDHOLD (NOT TO EXCEED 6 MONTHS) THE TREATING PROVIDER 
SHALL SUBMIT A COMPLETE, DICTATED MEBR 60 DAYS IN ADVANCE TO PERS-95.
9.  PEB PROCESS:

AND VITAL COMPONENTS OF APPROPRIATE PATIENT CARE, AS WELL AS COMPELLING 
READINESS ISSUES WHOSE APPROPRIATE EXECUTION SERVES AS A TANGIBLE FORCE 
MULTIPLIER."  IF AT ANY TIME DURING THE RC MEDHOLD PROCESS, IT APPEARS 
THE SAILOR WILL NOT BE FOUND FIT FOR DUTY WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME 
BASED ON CONDITION, PROGRESS, AND BEST AVAILABLE MEDICAL EVIDENCE, (NO 
MATTER THE TIME SPENT ON MEDHOLD) THE TREATING PROVIDER SHALL RECOMMEND
