RMKS/1. Purpose. This NAVADMIN directs Commanding Officers to take
positive action to ensure all assigned personnel have updated
personal identification and contact information via milConnect. This
action is the critical first step required to support the
implementation of Enterprise Directory Services (EDS), required by
references (a) and (b). Further, Commanding Officers are directed to
ensure that their command check-in processes include verification that
individuals have updated data in milConnect to reflect their new
contact information.

2. Background. EDS is a foundational element of the DoD wide Identity
and Access Management (IdAM) infrastructure. A common Global Address
List (GAL) is the end user service which leverages authoritative
information and attributes to facilitate secure information sharing,
collaboration, and people discovery across a single and/or multiple
information technology enterprises. The Navy GAL is
updated and maintained utilizing data contained within milConnect.
When contact information is outdated or incorrect within the
milConnect database, that outdated or incorrect contact information
populates the Navy GAL, corrupting it and impeding
Navy personnel from utilizing the GAL to efficiently contact and
communicate with one another.

3. Navy-wide, despite previous guidance, there is a lack of
understanding of the detrimental effects of failure to update personal
data in milConnect and the role milConnect plays in updating other
services beyond the GAL, such as DEERS.

4. As a result, widespread incorrect contact information is
interfering with the ability to efficiently contact personnel to
conduct urgent business. This issue has caught the attention of
senior leadership * Commanders must ensure it has theirs.

5. Reporting. Commanding Officers shall report completion of
command-wide milConnect updates to their Immediate Superior In Command
(ISIC) no later than 25 June 2014. Echelon II Command Information
Officers (CIOs) are directed to collect and report their own and
subordinate commands* compliance to the Department of Navy Deputy Chief
Information Officer (DDCIO(N)) by 26 June 2014. Compliance reporting
may be forwarded via e-mail to governance(at)navy.mil.

6. Instructions. Personnel can update their organizational and contact
data in milConnect by following the instructions outlined below.
   A. Launch Microsoft Internet Explorer, version 8 or higher.
   B. In the address bar, type:
https:(slash slash)www.dmdc.osd.mil(slash)milconnect and select
