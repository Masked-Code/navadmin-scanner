SUBJ/CNO BIRTHDAY MESSAGE TO THE FLEET//

1. Shipmates, this year we are celebrating our 245th Birthday virtually, 
around the world, together.

2. Although this birthday is different than in past years, what has not 
changed is how proud we can be of two and a half centuries of tradition, as 
well as our Sailors who continue to build our legacy with family members and 
loved ones at their side.

3. Today, Sailors stand the watch from the Western Atlantic to the South 
China Sea, and from the High North to the South Pacific. Your Navy enables 
prosperity 24/7/365 - at home and abroad - by helping keep the maritime 
commons free and open. And I promise you that our allies and partners - as 
well as your fellow Americans - all sleep better because you are there.

4. Our birthday is an important occasion because we celebrate our rich past, 
recognize the accomplishments of our shipmates today, and look to our bright 
future ahead.

5. The Navy needs you to be the best that you can be. Serve others. Be 
courageous. And always remember that America has a great Navy.

6. Happy 245th Birthday Navy Family. See you in the Fleet, Shipmates.

7. Released by Admiral Mike Gilday, Chief of Naval Operations.//
