SUBJ/2008 DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE//
RMKS/1.  WE WILL SOON OBSERVE THE DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE AND HOLOCAUST 
REMEMBRANCE DAY.  THE THEME FOR THIS YEAR'S OBSERVANCE IS "DO NOT STAND
SILENT:  REMEMBERING KRISTALLNACHT 1938."  DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE WILL BE 
OBSERVED 27 APRIL THROUGH 4 MAY, AND HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY IS 2 MAY.
2.  A JOINT RESOLUTION WAS PASSED IN 1980 TO DEDICATE ONE WEEK EACH 
YEAR TO THIS REMEMBRANCE.  THE WEEK TYPICALLY ENCOMPASSES HOLOCAUST 
REMEMBRANCE DAY (YOM HASHOAH), THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF REMEMBRANCE.
THE PURPOSE OF THE DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE OBSERVANCE IS TO REFLECT UPON, 
TO LEARN ABOUT, AND NEVER FORGET WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MILLIONS SILENCED 
DURING THE HOLOCAUST.  
3.  AT THE BENEDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM 
IN 1988, PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN SAID, "AMERICAN TROOPS WHO LIBERATED 
CONCENTRATION CAMPS SAW THINGS NO HUMAN EYES SHOULD EVER SEE.  BUT IF 
WE IN AMERICA REMAIN STRONG - IF WE HOLD FAST AND TRUE TO THE 
CONVICTION THAT, YES, THERE ARE THINGS WORTH FIGHTING FOR, AND WE WILL 
HEED THE CALL IF WE MUST - HUMANS WILL NEVER SUFFER SO, NOR WILL OTHERS 
BE CALLED UPON TO SAVE THEM FROM SUCH SUFFERING."
4.  COMMANDS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO OBSERVE HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE 
DAY THROUGH EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, EXHIBITS, PUBLICATIONS, AND
