SUBJ/FALL 2009 SEASONAL AND NOVEL H1N1 INFLUENZA PREPAREDNESS//

RMKS/1. THIS MESSAGE APPLIES TO ALL NAVY PERSONNEL, UNIFORMED AND 
CIVILIAN.  ECHELON II COMMANDERS AND ALL REGIONAL COMMANDERS SHALL 
ENSURE WIDEST DISSEMINATION TO ALL SUBORDINATE AND TENANT COMMANDS AND 
DETACHMENTS FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION UPON RECEIPT.

2. THE 2009/2010 FLU SEASON IS RAPIDLY APPROACHING. THIS YEAR'S 
PREVENTION CAMPAIGN WILL BEGIN EARLIER THAN PREVIOUS YEARS.

3. THIS YEAR'S FLU SEASON WILL INCLUDE THE SEASONAL AND THE NOVEL
(H1N1) INFLUENZA VIRUSES. EACH WILL REQUIRE A SEPARATE IMMUNIZATION.
THE SEASONAL VACCINE IS AVAILABLE NOW. THE H1N1 VACCINE IS UNDERGOING 
TESTING AND IS EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE IN MID-OCTOBER.

4. IMMUNIZATION REMAINS THE PRIMARY METHOD OF REDUCING INFLUENZA 
ILLNESS AND ITS COMPLICATIONS. INFLUENZA VACCINES NOT ONLY HELP PROTECT 
VACCINATED INDIVIDUALS, BUT ALSO HELP PROTECT ENTIRE COMMUNITIES BY 
REDUCING THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE. CURRENT DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) 
POLICY REQUIRES ANNUAL INFLUENZA VACCINATIONS FOR ALL ACTIVE DUTY 
MILITARY PERSONNEL, SELECTED RESERVE, AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS. ALL 
BENEFICIARIES, WHO PHYSICALLY QUALIFY, ARE ALSO HIGHLY ENCOURAGE TO GET 
VACCINATED.

5. THERE ARE SIMPLE AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE MEASURES WE CAN ALL TAKE TO 
STAY HEALTHY:
A. FIRST AND FOREMOST, STAY INFORMED. THE NAVY’S CENTRAL INFORMATION 
WEBSITE FOR SEASONAL FLU AND H1N1 INFORMATION IS COMMANDER, NAVY 
INSTALLATION COMMAND WEBSITE -- OPERATION PREPARE AT 
HTTPS://WWW.CNIC.NAVY.MIL/CINC_HQ_SITE/OPERATIONPREPARE/
FLUINFORMATION/INDEX.HTM.
B. GET VACCINATED.
C. IF AT ALL POSSIBLE, STAY HOME IF YOU ARE SICK. THE CENTER FOR 
DISEASE CONTROL RECOMMENDS THAT YOU STAY HOME FROM WORK OR SCHOOL AND 
LIMIT CONTACT FROM OTHERS TO KEEP FROM INFECTING THEM.
D. WASH YOUR HANDS OFTEN WITH SOAP AND WATER, ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU 
COUGH OR SNEEZE. ALCOHOL BASED HAND CLEANERS ARE ALSO EFFECTIVE.
E. COVER YOUR MOUTH AND NOSE WITH A TISSUE WHEN YOU SNEEZE AND THROW 
THE TISSUE IN THE TRASH AFTER YOU USE IT.
F. AVOID TOUCHING YOUR EYES, NOSE AND MOUTH. GERMS ARE OFTEN SPREAD 
WHEN A PERSON TOUCHES SOMETHING THAT IS CONTAMINATED WITH GERMS AND 
THEN TOUCHES HIS/HER FACE.

6. OVER THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS, YOU CAN EXPECT A CONCERTED 
CAMPAIGN TO PROVIDE UPDATED INFORMATION AND FURTHER GUIDANCE ON NAVY-
WIDE SEASONAL FLU AND H1N1 IMMUNIZATION AND MITIGATION EFFORTS.
U.S. FLEET FORCES COMMAND HAS PROMULGATED GUIDANCE TO THE AFLOAT UNITS 
TO ENSURE THEY MAINTAIN THE REQUIRED LEVELS OF OPERATIONAL READINESS.

7. COMMANDERS AND COMMANDING OFFICERS WILL ENSURE OUR SAILORS AND 
CIVILIAN SHIPMATES CARRY THIS MESSAGE HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES THIS YEAR. 
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE INCLUDE THESE CRITICAL AUDIENCES IN OUR 
EFFORTS. ALL COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO USE ALL MEDIUMS (I.E., 
NEWSLETTERS, WEBSITES, EMAIL, OMBUDSMAN, AND EXISTING SOCIAL MEDIA) TO 
ENSURE THE WIDEST DISSEMINATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF INFORMATION.

8. RELEASED BY VICE ADMIRAL SAM J. LOCKLEAR III, DIRECTOR, NAVY 
STAFF.//
