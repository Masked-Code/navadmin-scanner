RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN replaces reference (a) and announces the 
policy and guidance for Calendar Year (CY) 2021 Season Two (S2) 
Meritorious Advancement Program (MAP) for Active and Full-Time 
Support Sailors, which will run from 1 September through 15 October 
2021. 
 
2.  In order to preserve advancement opportunity via the navy wide 
advancement exam (NWAE) and control over-advancing a particular 
rating and paygrade, MAP advancement to the ABF3, ABF2, ABF1, ABH3, 
ABH2, BM3, BM2, BM1, and RS3 rates will be controlled as outlined in 
paragraph 5.  The decision to control these rates was made based on 
a variety of factors, to include low NWAE advancement opportunity 
and proportionality of total MAP advancements in each rate. 
 
3.  MAP will account for approximately 20 percent of total 
advancements in CY21 with roughly half of the available MAP quotas 
allocated for each season.  All unused quotas will be factored into 
the NWAE cycle.  We are maintaining the two-season framework that 
aligns MAP with the NWAE to emphasize the intent of MAP in selecting 
and rewarding our most talented Sailors. 
 
4.  Commands are required to submit their MAP advancement(s) through 
Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).  NSIPS Web Afloat 
users and commands without access to NSIPS should refer to paragraph 
4a for instructions on submitting their MAP advancements.  The 
system will use authoritative data to determine eligibility. 
However, commands are still required to locally validate that MAP 
candidates have successfully completed the professional military 
knowledge eligibility examination (PMK-EE) requirement prior to the 
first day of the MAP season, as outlined in reference (b). 
    a.  NSIPS Web Afloat users and commands without access to NSIPS 
must submit a MAP nomination request via e-mail directly to their 
immediate superior in charge (ISIC), type commander (TYCOM) or 
budget submitting office (BSO)/echelon II command using the 
meritorious certification letter (MCL).  The letter must be signed 
by the commanding officer and should address any exceptions to 
policy (ETP) and/or additional quotas requested.  Sample MCLs and 
detailed information regarding the offline process can be found via 
MyNavy Portal (MNP) at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-
promotion/a-enlisted-advancement-resources-and-links, then 
select the *Websites* tab in the blue banner, and then select the 
MAP homepage. 
    b.  Quota usage, modifications and distribution will be managed 
within the NSIPS environment.  BSO and command quotas will be 
uploaded into NSIPS on 15 August 2021 and can be found under the 
quota summary report tab.  Quotas can also be found via MNP at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/a-enlisted-
advancement-resources-and-links, then select the *Websites* tab in 
the blue banner, and then select the MAP homepage. 
    c.  Additional quotas can be requested using the quota request 
option.  Commands must contact their BSO to determine timeline for 
additional quota requests.  Whether or not command quotas are 
authorized, all commands are authorized to request quotas from their 
BSO/echelon II command, via their ISIC and TYCOM. 
    d.  The system will automatically determine if an ETP is 
required using predetermined criteria.  Service Members in ratings 
requiring security clearances and rates/pay grades requiring time in 
rate (TIR) waivers will be automatically routed for adjudication. 
The request will be routed through the ISIC, TYCOM, and BSO/echelon 
II command using a hierarchical workflow. 
    e.  NSIPS will not automatically generate an ETP for Nuclear- 
trained Service Members.  Commands desiring to advance a nuclear- 
trained Service Member not meeting the TIR requirement must request 
an ETP to Director, Military Personnel Plans and Policy (OPNAV N13) 
via Nuclear Program Manager (OPNAV N133).  E-5s require a TIR date 
of 1 July 2019 or earlier to be eligible for advancement to E-6. 
 
5.  MAP Advancements in Controlled Rates.  Commands desiring to MAP 
advance a Sailor to ABF3, ABF2, ABF1, ABH3, ABH2, BM3, BM2, BM1, or 
RS3 must submit a request to their BSO, via their ISIC and TYCOM, 
using the quota request option in NSIPS.  If the command does not 
have access to NSIPS, they should follow the procedures in paragraph 
 
4a.  BSOs will be granted MAP quotas for each rate based on the 
proportion of the billets authorized (BA) at the lower paygrade of 
that rate under that BSO.  If there are not enough quotas for all 
BSOs, the quotas will be allocated to the BSOs with the largest 
amount of BA.  BSOs will be contacted by Enlisted Community 
Management Division (BUPERS-32) to inform them of assigned quotas 
for controlled rates.  Commands will submit requests to the BSOs 
using the template provided on the MAP homepage via MNP at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/a-enlisted-
advancement-resources-and-links, then select the *Websites* tab in 
the blue banner, and then select the MAP homepage. 
 
6.  MAP Website.  MAP Quotas by unit identification code (UIC), 
forms and frequently asked questions can be found on MNP at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/a-enlisted-
advancement-resources-and-links, then select the *Websites* tab in 
the blue banner and then select the MAP homepage.  The list of 
points of contact for each BSO/echelon II command and list of parent 
and subordinate UICs can also be found on the above website.  More 
detailed information on the MAP program can be found in Chapter 10 
of reference (c).

8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
