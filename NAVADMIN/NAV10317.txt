MSGID/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/N09/SEP// SUBJ/NAVY BUDGET SUBMISSION 
BACKGROUND// 

RMKS/1.  RECENT FEEDBACK FROM THE FLEET SUGGESTS A NEED TO CLARIFY THE 
NAVY'S APPROACH IN THE CURRENT BUDGET CYCLE.  NEW DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
(DOD) DIRECTION FOR ITS FISCAL YEAR 2012 BUDGET AND THE AGGRESSIVE 
INITIATIVES THAT FOLLOWED TO IDENTIFY "EFFICIENCIES"
ACROSS ALL NAVY ACCOUNTS MAKE THIS BUDGET CYCLE DIFFERENT.  IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT ALL PERSONNEL UNDERSTAND WHY THE NAVY AND THE OTHER 
SERVICES HAVE RENEWED EFFORTS TO CHALLENGE ASSUMPTIONS AND SCRUTINIZE 
COSTS.  I WANT TO ENSURE A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF THE BASIS FOR 
DECISIONS BEING MADE HERE IN WASHINGTON AND ALIGN ACTIONS AND MESSAGES 
RELATED TO THIS EFFORT.

2.  AS THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAS EMPHASIZED, OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IS 
LINKED TO OUR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY.  IN JUNE, HE PROVIDED GUIDANCE TO 
IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS.  GIVEN THE 
ECONOMIC CHALLENGES FACING OUR NATION, HE ESTABLISHED SAVINGS TARGETS 
AND DIRECTED THE SERVICES TO REALLOCATE RESOURCES WITHIN THEIR EXISTING 
BUDGETS TO IMPROVE COMBAT CAPABILITY, TO INCLUDE INCREASED FUNDING FOR 
PERSONNEL IN OPERATIONAL UNITS, FORCE STRUCTURE, READINESS, AND FUTURE 
MILITARY CAPABILITIES.  THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT - WE ARE NOT CUTTING 
MONEY FROM THE NAVY BUDGET, WE ARE MOVING IT WITHIN THE BUDGET.  
SPECIFICALLY, TWO THIRDS OF THE MOVEMENT IS TO COME FROM SUPPORT OR 
OVERHEAD FUNCTIONS (TAIL) AND MUST BE REINVESTED IN WARFIGHTING 
CAPABILITY (TOOTH), FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 100 BILLION DOLLARS IN 
OVERHEAD COSTS ACROSS DOD OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.  NAVY WAS DELIBERATE 
IN WHERE IT DECIDED TO PROPOSE "EFFICIENCIES" AND APPLY THEM TO 
WARFIGHTING "ENHANCEMENTS ".  BUILDING UPON EFFORTS STARTED IN PREVIOUS 
BUDGET CYCLES AND DRAWING ON INNOVATIVE IDEAS FROM ACROSS THE NAVY ON 
HOW WE COULD BECOME MORE EFFICIENT, NAVY LEADERSHIP IDENTIFIED SPECIFIC 
AREAS IN WHICH WE COULD REDUCE COSTS AND, IN SOME CASES, STOP PERFORMING 
CERTAIN FUNCTIONS WHILE MAINTAINING ACCEPTABLE RISK.  WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN 
A HARD LOOK AT PROCUREMENT AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNTS TO 
ENSURE ADEQUATE INVESTMENT IN OUR CORE CAPABILITIES.  THESE PROPOSALS 
ARE NOT ACROSS THE BOARD OR INDISCRIMINATE CUTS.
3.  NAVY SUBMITTED ITS BUDGET FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO DOD FOR REVIEW 
ON 30 JULY.  AT THIS STAGE, THE NAVY'S BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEARS 2012-2016 
IS A PROPOSAL PENDING HIGHER LEVEL REVIEW AND ULTIMATE APPROVAL BY THE 
PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS.  SPECIFIC DETAILS AND DISCUSSIONS REGARDING 
NAVY'S PROPOSED EFFICIENCIES AND ITERATIVE BUDGET SUBMISSIONS ARE PRE-
DECISIONAL, AND SHOULD NOT BE COMMENTED ON OUTSIDE NAVY AND DOD 
CHANNELS.

4.  THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY REMAINS COMMITTED TO WORKING MORE 
EFFICIENTLY IN THIS RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENT AND DELIVERING A 
MISSION-FOCUSED FORCE TO MEET THE FULL SPECTRUM OF CURRENT AND FUTURE 
OPERATIONAL DEMANDS.  BUILDING THE NAVY OF THE FUTURE REQUIRES NEW 
THINKING AND BOLD ACTION.  AS THE BUDGET PROCESS CONTINUES, INPUT FROM 
THE FLEET AND SHORE COMMANDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE CRITICAL TO EXECUTING 
OUR FINAL BUDGET AND ENSURING THE FULL BENEFIT OF OUR REINVESTMENTS.  
PLEASE ENSURE WIDEST DISSEMINATION.

5.  VICE CHIEF SENDS.
