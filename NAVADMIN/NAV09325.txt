SUBJ/2009 CHAPLAIN CORPS ANNIVERSARY MESSAGE//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE 2009 CHAPLAIN CORPS ANNIVERSARY.  
NOVEMBER 28TH MARKS THE 234TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE 
NAVY CHAPLAIN CORPS.  SINCE THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR, NAVY CHAPLAINS HAVE 
BEEN PROVIDING MINISTRY TO SEA SERVICE PERSONNEL AND THEIR FAMILIES.  
WITH DEDICATION AND UNWAVERING COMMITMENT, THEY HAVE SERVED NAVY, 
MARINE CORPS, COAST GUARD, AND MERCHANT MARINE PERSONNEL ASHORE AND 
AFLOAT.  CURRENTLY, NAVY CHAPLAINS ARE FORWARD DEPLOYED ON SHIPS AROUND 
THE GLOBE, ON THE GROUND WITH SAILORS AND MARINES IN THEATER, ALONGSIDE 
THOSE WHO GUARD OUR SHORES, AND AT INSTALLATIONS BOTH AT HOME AND 
OVERSEAS.

2.  IN WAR AND IN PEACE, THEY SUPPORT THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION FOR 
THOSE WHO SERVE OUR COUNTRY, FACILITATING THE RELIGIOUS PRACTICES OF 
ALL.  NAVY CHAPLAINS ADVISE COMMANDERS ON MORAL, ETHICAL, AND SPIRITUAL 
MATTERS AND EXTEND SPIRITUAL GUIDANCE AND PASTORAL CARE WHENEVER AND 
WHEREVER NEEDED.  CHAPLAINS AND RELIGIOUS PROGRAM SPECIALISTS 
CONTRIBUTE DAILY TO THE READINESS AND RESILIENCE OF OUR PEOPLE.

3.  I WANT TO THANK OUR CHAPLAINS FOR THEIR UNTIRING EFFORTS, AND  WISH 
ALL OF THEM A ?HAPPY BIRTHDAY.?
