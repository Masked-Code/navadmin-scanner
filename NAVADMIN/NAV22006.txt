RMKS/1. In the CNO's January 11th remarks at the 34th Surface Navy 
Association (SNA) Symposium, he issued a call to accelerate our competitive 
edge as the world's strongest Navy by scaling the Get Real and Get Better 
approach consistently used by our best units and organizations:
"History shows the navy which adapts, learns and improves the fastest gains 
an enduring warfighting advantage.  The essential element is fostering an 
ecosystem a culture  that assesses, corrects, and innovates better than the 
opposition."
 
2. In concert with this call to action, the CNO released an updated Charge of
Command for our Commanding Officers, characterizing it as "a clear statement 
of what I value in our leaders, what we should expect our teams to embody, 
and the mindset we need to win the future fight."
 
3. In his implementation guidance to the Flag and SES Wardroom, CNO removed 
the requirement for Commanding Officers to sign the Charge, asking that it be 
used to inspire and mentor Commanding Officers.  He also set the expectation 
for Senior Leaders to take pride in executing the Charge's mandate to measure
themselves by how well they remove barriers and create opportunities for
improved subordinate Commander performance.
 
4. The Charge directs Commanding Officers to lead their team in "Get Real, 
Get Better behavior and problem solving  our self-assessing, self-correcting, 
and learning culture."  The Get Real Get Better approach brings to life 
leadership and problem-solving best practices demonstrated in our best 
organizations and refined over the past four years. It's a proven approach 
for empowering our people and achieving exceptional outcomes.
 
5. As he closed his SNA remarks, CNO asked each of us on the Navy team to 
read the Charge of Command and apply the principles of continuous Self-
Assessment and Self-Correction, measuring ourselves, our team, and our 
commands by Get Real Get Better principles.  Best practice is to do this 
transparently and with others, sharing our ideas and enhancing our learning.
 
6.  CNOs SNA speech, the Charge of Command, and Get Real Get Better reference
materials are available on the Navy.mil website.  Additional material will be
released over the remainder of 2022.
