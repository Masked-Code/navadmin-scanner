RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces changes to references (a) through
(f) for the physical readiness program related to fitness reports, 
evaluations, and reenlistment and extension recommendations.  These changes 
remove mandatory significant problem comments and administrative actions 
concerning physical readiness program failures.  Additionally, the Navy will 
conduct a single Calendar Year (CY) 2025 Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA) 
cycle.

2.  Navy's Culture of Excellence 2.0 charges our leaders to build great 
people, great leaders, and great teams:  their minds, bodies, and spirits, 
eliminating barriers wherever possible.  In response, we are modernizing our 
PFA policy to acknowledge our diverse population, increase Sailor trust, and 
enhance quality of service.
Building the bodies of great people is more than annual (or
biannual) testing and includes ensuring healthy food, adequate sleep, 
opportunities to exercise (especially outside), and medical readiness.  
Commanding Officers (COs) are able to evaluate a Sailor's physical readiness 
progress or lack of progress in performance evaluations, giving them the 
ability to manage risk, recognize earnest effort, and best take care of their 
people.

3.  Effective immediately:
    a.  Enlisted Evaluation/Officer Fitness Reports.
        (1) No mandated or prohibited trait mark is required in *Military 
Bearing/Professionalism* for promotability and/or retention for the reporting 
period in which member's first PFA failure occurs.  COs will evaluate the 
Sailor's PFA progress or lack of progress when evaluating performance.
        (2) For a reporting period in which a member has accumulated two 
consecutive PFA failures:
            (a) Enlisted members are not mandated to receive minimal marks or 
trait grades in Military Bearing/Professionalism (CHIEFEVAL block 35 and EVAL 
block 36) or Significant Problems and Retention Not Recommended (EVAL block 
45 and block 47).  COs are encouraged to document a member's progress and 
initiative in attaining current physical fitness standards in the narrative 
section (CHIEFEVAL Block
41 or EVAL Block 43) and suitability for retention (EVAL Block 47).
            (b) Officers are not mandated to receive minimal marks or trait 
grades in Military Bearing (FITREP block 35) nor marked for Significant 
Problems (FITREP block 42).  COs are encouraged to document member's progress 
and initiative in attaining current physical fitness standards and 
suitability for retention in comments section (FITREP block 41).
    b.  Retention Recommendations.  Eligibility for enlisted members will be 
at the discretion of the CO.  However, if retention or reenlistment 
eligibility is removed, the CO may submit a special evaluation report to 
restore eligibility.
        (1) Commands shall not process for administrative separation Sailors 
who were conditionally reenlisted under a PFA readiness waiver and 
subsequently failed an official PFA.
        (2) Reporting Seniors retain the authority to recommend against 
retention through the use of an adverse evaluation.
        (3) This change provides command leadership discretion on retention 
recommendations to exercise in the best interests of the Navy.  In exercising 
this discretion, commands should consider a
Sailor's:
            (a) Qualification for continued service, based on the Sailor's 
ability to perform the functions of their rate without physical or medical 
limitation at sea, shore or isolated duty,
            (b) Their overall ability to contribute to Navy missions, and
            (c) The likelihood of improvement in meeting PFA standards within 
the next 12 months.
    c.  Enlisted advancement.  Failure of a PFA removes the Sailor's 
eligibility for advancement, including the ability to negotiate for billet-
based advancement orders or effecting legacy advancements.
        (1) Though submission of an adverse evaluation is no longer required, 
COs who decide not to issue an adverse evaluation and withdraw advancement 
are directed to withhold advancement eligibility for any enlisted Sailor that 
fails a PFA cycle (until a subsequent official or mock PFA is passed) by 
submitting a signed NAVPERS 1070/613 to Navy Educational and Professional 
Development Center, utilizing procedures as detailed in reference (b).
        (2) An advancement withhold should be placed on the record for every 
subsequent PFA failure the CO decides not to issue an adverse evaluation on 
until a mock or official PFA has been passed or the advancement 
recommendation has been completely withdrawn through the use of an adverse 
evaluation.
    d.  Officer Promotions.  Officers who fail one PFA will continue to be 
ineligible for promotion per reference (c).

4.  CY25 PFA Cycle.  The Navy-wide PFA cycle will be from 1 February to 30 
November 2025 in line with references (c) through (f), which are located at:  
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/Culture-Resilience/Physical-
Readiness/

5.  The point of contact for questions is My Navy Career Center at
(833) 330-MNCC or askmncc.fct@navy.mil

6.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
