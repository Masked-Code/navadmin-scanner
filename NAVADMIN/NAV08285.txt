SUBJ/NAVY BIRTHDAY 2008// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/ 1.  AS WE MARK THE 233RD BIRTHDAY OF OUR NAVY, I THANK 
ALL WHO SERVE TODAY AND HAVE SERVED BEFORE; SAILORS, NAVY CIVILIANS, 
AND FAMILIES.  OUR DISTINGUISHED PAST IS PRELUDE TO OUR GREAT FUTURE; A 
FUTURE THAT IS SHAPED BY THE HONOR, COURAGE, AND SACRIFICE OF THOSE WHO 
SERVE TODAY.  IT IS FITTING THAT WE TAKE THE TIME TO REFLECT ON OUR 
EXTRAORDINARY HERITAGE ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF OUR ESTABLISHMENT.
2.  THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED SINCE THE DAYS OF SAIL IN 1775 
HAVE EXEMPLIFIED THE CORE VALUES THAT ARE AT THE HEART OF OUR NAVY, THE 
MOST POWERFUL AND INFLUENTIAL TO EVER SAIL THE OCEANS.  WHETHER IT WAS 
THE SAILOR ON DECK IN THE WAR OF 1812, OR ADMIRAL CHESTER NIMITZ 
LEADING IN THE PACIFIC, OR PETTY OFFICER MICHAEL MONSOOR FIGHTING IN 
IRAQ, WE HAVE A STORIED PAST THAT MAKES IT EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE 
HAVE ACHIEVED GREATNESS.  THAT GREATNESS CONTINUES IN THE LIVES OF OUR 
SAILORS, NAVY CIVILIANS, AND FAMILIES TODAY WHOSE DEDICATION AND 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR CURRENT FIGHT ARE ENSURING STABILITY, SECURITY, 
AND OUR WAY OF LIFE.  WE OPERATE ACROSS THE FULL RANGE OF OPERATIONS, 
IN ALL CORNERS OF THE GLOBE, TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER, SAFER PLACE - 
OUR LEGACY IS DEFINED BY OUR ACTIONS TODAY.  
3.  I HAVE SEEN THE WORK YOU DO AROUND THE WORLD AND I COULD NOT BE 
MORE PROUD AND INSPIRED.  YOUR SERVICE AND SACRIFICE EXEMPLIFY THE 
CHARACTER OF OUR NAVY AND THE IDEAL OF SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY.  YOUR 
DEDICATION SERVES TO INSPIRE OTHERS AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO ACTIVELY 
PARTICIPATE IN THE MANY CELEBRATIONS THAT WILL COMMEMORATE THIS EVENT.  
WHETHER YOU ARE ATTENDING A NAVY BALL, HAVING A COMMAND FUNCTION, 
SPEAKING WITH A LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUP, OR BEING INTERVIEWED BY THE 
MEDIA, A FRIEND, OR A NEIGHBOR, REMEMBER OUR PROUD PAST AND HOW WE 
BUILD ON IT TODAY.  
4.  ENJOY THE DAY AND THE FESTIVITIES, AND TAKE TIME TO REFLECT ON THE 
PRIVILEGE WE HAVE TO SERVE IN THE GREATEST NAVY THAT HAS EVER SAILED.  
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SHIPMATES.  
5.  ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
