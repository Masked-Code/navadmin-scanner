REF B IS OPNAVINST 1120.12A, APPOINTMENT OF LIMITED DUTY OFFICERS AND CHIEF 
WARRANT OFFICERS IN THE NAVY RESERVE.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the merger of Reserve component surface 
ordnance Limited Duty Officers (LDO) and Chief Warrant Officers (CWO), 
designators 616X/716X, into the surface electronics LDO and CWO designators 
618X/718X and announces updates to references (a) and (b).

2.  A growing surface Fleet requires a pool of highly-skilled Reserve combat 
systems/weapons subject matter experts to meet the technical requirements of 
the future.  Merger of these designators and similar skillsets will result in 
a more robust and flexible personnel inventory.

3.  The implementation process will consist of two phases.
    a.  Phase I will begin immediately with the conversion of all Reserve 
616X/716X billets to 618X/718X.
    b.  Phase II will begin approximately one month from the date of billet 
conversion and will re-designate all Reserve officers.
        (1) Current officers will be re-designated from
6165/7168 to 6185/7188.
        (2) Applicants that have submitted applications to the Fiscal Year 
(FY) 2023, (FY-23) Reserve LDO/CWO In-Service Procurement Board (ISPB) will 
be considered for selection to the 716X or 718X designator as applicable.  
Announcement results and commissioning documents will reflect 718X.
Designators 616X and 618X are not being considered on the FY-23 Reserve ISPB.

4.  No administrative action is required by individual officers.

5.  Surface Ordnance CWOs (7168) will continue to wear current designator 
device on the collar, sleeve and shoulder boards until promoted to their next 
higher grade.

6.  Point of contact is Reserve Officer Community Manager, CDR Heidi Cochran, 
at (901)874-3482/DSN 882, or e-mail heidi.e.cochran.mil(at)us.navy.mil.
