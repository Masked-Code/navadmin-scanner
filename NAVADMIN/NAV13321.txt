SUBJ/HOLIDAY MESSAGE 2013//

REMARKS/1.  Shipmates, this holiday season Darleen and I would
like to thank you, our Navy Team, for all that you do in the 
service of our Nation.

2.  During 2013, our Navy professionally conducted a broad array
of exercises and operations with allies and partners around the
globe.  In every real world and training event, our success 
rested upon the dedication and integrity of our Sailors, 
Civilians, and Families.  Your indomitable commitment to 
accomplish a staggering array of missions has been
inspirational.

3.  At this moment, tens of thousands of our shipmates are 
operating forward, on land and at sea, in every corner of the 
world.  They are on station, ready to respond where it matters, 
when it matters.  For those who are deployed this season, you 
and your families are in our thoughts and prayers, we wish you 
well, and we thank you for your service.  For those at home, 
Darleen and I wish you a safe holiday season filled with joy and 
time shared with loved ones.  For the entire Navy family, we 
wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! 

4.  Released by the Chief of Naval Operations.//
