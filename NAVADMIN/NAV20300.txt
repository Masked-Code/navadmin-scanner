RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance to Navy personnel, employees and 
commands on implementation of the Executive Order (EO) on Combating Race and 
Sex Stereotyping as detailed in references (a) through (f).  References (e) 
and (f) affirm the commitment of the Federal Government to the fair and equal 
treatment of all individuals before the law and express the policy that the 
United States will not promote race and sex stereotyping.

2.  In accordance with references (a) through (e), reference (f) directs the 
suspension of training related to diversity and inclusion.  Per reference 
(f), effectively immediately:
    a.  Navy will suspend all civilian personnel training relating to 
diversity and inclusion.  Prior to resuming civilian training, it must be 
reviewed and cleared by the OPM for compliance with the EO and certified as 
compliant by the Secretary of the Navy.  The Assistant Secretary of the Navy 
(Manpower and Reserve Affairs) Performing the Duty of Under Secretary of the 
Navy (ASN (M and RA), PTDO UNSECNAV) will submit all requests for 
preclearance of civilian training to OPM via the Under Secretary of Defense 
for Personnel and Readiness, and certify the training.  Further guidance 
directing the certification process for civilian training is forthcoming by 
the Office of Civilian Human Resources.  Any expenditure by the Navy on 
diversity and inclusion training for civilian employees must be approved in 
advance by ASN (M and RA), PTDO UNSECNAV.
    b.  The Navy will suspend all military training relating to diversity and 
inclusion.  Prior to resumption of diversity and inclusion training for 
military personnel, ASN (M and RA), PTDO UNSECNAV must certify it as 
compliant with the EO.
    c.  Each grant issuing organization in the Navy will review its grant 
programs and identify programs for which, as a condition of receiving such a 
grant, the Navy may require the recipient to certify that Federal funds will 
not be used to promote concepts prohibited by the EO.

3.  Definition of Training.  For the purposes of this NAVADMIN, the following 
definition of training applies, adapted from reference (g).  Training is the 
process of providing for or making available a planned, prepared and 
coordinated program or routine of instruction, other than a formal academic 
course, intended to improve individual and organizational performance and 
assist in achieving the mission and performance goals of the Navy.  Training 
may appear in a variety of formats, including the following outlined in 
reference (d):
    a.  Training that is conducted or led by Government employees,
    b.  Training that is conducted or led by contractors or others,
    c.  Live training sessions conducted in person or by any electronic 
means, whether telephonic or video,
    d.  Materials posted on public-facing or internal Internet or Intranet 
sites of any Federal agency, and,
    e.  Written or video materials or other content that have been produced 
or procured with Federal funds and that are available to the general public 
or that Federal employees are required or permitted to read or view.

4.  Consistent with paragraphs 2 and 3 above, the following are examples of 
types of training that must be suspended.  Please note this list is not all-
inclusive.
    a.  Naval Leadership and Ethics Center training relating to diversity and 
inclusion,
    b.  Naval Postgraduate School/U.S. Naval War College/U.S. Naval 
Academy/Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps training relating to diversity 
and inclusion,
    c.  Diversity and inclusion topics which are part of training symposia or 
conferences, often hosted by commanders and senior enlisted leaders (note  
entire conference or symposia does not have to be cancelled  just the 
training topics on diversity and inclusion),
    d.  Command level training on diversity and inclusion (such as General 
Military Training, Brown Bag lunches, etc.), and
    e.  Diversity and inclusion presentations available on a command website.

5.  This NAVADMIN does not prohibit Equal Opportunity and Equal Employment 
Opportunity (EEO) training provided the training does not include diversity 
and inclusion modules or components.  Permissible Equal Opportunity/EEO 
training includes topics that focus on compliance with law and regulation.

6.  Discussions that touch on diversity and inclusion are not prohibited 
provided they do not constitute training.  Hallmarks of permissible 
discussions include discussions which are:
    a.  Voluntary,
    b.  Accurately described as listening sessions to hear and share personal 
experiences and perspectives without endorsement or judgment by supervisors 
or the chain of command,
    c.  Often conducted in smaller groups, with a focus on understanding 
personal experiences rather than presenting or providing instruction on 
concepts or policies.

7.  Resumption of diversity and inclusion training.  As discussed in 
paragraph 2, in order to resume civilian and military diversity and inclusion 
training, the training must go through a review and certification process 
facilitated by the Department of the Navy (DON).
    a.  Civilian Training.  Once further information for the certification of 
civilian training is received from higher authority, it will be promulgated 
via separate correspondence.
    b.  Military Training.  Office of the Chief of Naval Operations
(N1) will promulgate procedures and guidelines to submit military training 
certification requests to echelon II commanders via Department of the Navy 
Tasking, Records and Consolidated Knowledge Repository (DONTRACKER) tasker.  
A detailed checklist and all references will be included in the tasker to 
facilitate the review of training materials.  All requests, after review and 
certification by an O-9 or above in the chain of command, will be routed to 
the Chief of Naval Personnel (Navy Chief Inclusion and Diversity
Officer) for review, consolidation and routing to ASN (M and RA), PTDO 
UNSECNAV.  To allow commands to commence gathering requisite information, 
requests shall include the following information:
        (1) Course name.
        (2) Course description, syllabus, and agenda, as available.
        (3) Whether the training is mandatory.  If so, who or what directs 
this mandatory course.
        (4) Approximate number of Service Members trained per session.
        (5) Frequency of training.
        (6) Location of training.
        (7) Approximate cost per training session.
        (8) In addition to above information, annotate Service representative 
(general/flag officers serving at the grade of O-9 or above in the chain of 
command) that reviewed and certified that the content of the military 
diversity and inclusion training request are compliant with the EO.

8.  Further guidance related to training provided by contractors is 
forthcoming from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, 
Development and Acquisition).

9.  Sailors are our asymmetric advantage in a complex and changing 
environment.  Optimizing the performance of our Navy team requires us all to 
drive toward a Culture of Excellence, a culture focused on the high ideals 
espoused in our core values of Honor, Courage and Commitment, a culture that 
respects each of the members of our Navy team.  When Sailors feel included, 
respected and empowered, they will be more ready to win wars, deter 
aggression and maintain freedom of the seas.

10.  For additional information, please contact RDML Putnam Browne, Director 
of 21st Century Sailor Office, via e-mail at putnam.h.browne1@navy.mil.

11.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
