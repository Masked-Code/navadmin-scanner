RMKS/1. RECENT NETWORK SECURITY BREACHES ARE INDICATORS THAT THROUGHOUT

4. FULL COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING SECURITY POLICIES AND STRICT ADHERENCE 
BY ALL HANDS, EVERY DAY, IS REQUIRED TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONAL 
READINESS AND WARFIGHTING CAPABILITIES. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS 
REQUIRED TO ENSURE OUR NETWORK SECURITY, WE NEED TO FOLLOW THE 
PROCEDURES THAT OUR SECURITY POLICIES REQUIRE, AND WE NEED TO ENSURE 
THAT LEADERS AT EVERY LEVEL UNDERSTAND THEIR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR 
MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF OUR NETWORKS.
5. BOTTOM LINE -
1) KNOW AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN NETWORK SECURITY,
2) FOLLOW APPROVED NETWORK OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES, AND
3) ENFORCE OUR NETWORK SECURITY STANDARDS.
