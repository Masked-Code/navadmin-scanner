SUBJ/2015 ACTIVE DUTY FUND DRIVE IN SUPPORT OF THE NAVY-MARINE CORPS RELIEF 
SOCIETY//

REF/A/SECNAVINST 5340.7//
AMPN/REF A IS SECNAVINST ACTIVE DUTY FUND DRIVE IN SUPPORT OF THE NAVY-MARINE 
CORPS RELIEF SOCIETY OF 8 FEBRUARY 1999//

RMKS/1.  The Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society has assisted our Sailors, 
Marines, and their families since 1904.  Whether helping Sailors travel to 
the bedside of an ill or injured family member, paying for urgent vehicle 
repairs, providing funds to pay a family's food, shelter and gas when a 
natural disaster strikes, or sending registered nurses to visit a Navy spouse 
and newborn, the society has consistently given peace of mind to Sailors in 
need.

2.  Just last year, the society's 3,700 volunteers and small cadre of 
employees coordinated $48 million dollars in interest-free loans and grants 
to more than 63,500 Sailors, Marines and their families. Supporting our Navy 
family with 24/7 on-call services at home and around the world, the society 
is a vital contributor to unit readiness -- and a lifeline when an unforeseen 
crisis exceeds a Sailor's financial ability to cope.

3.  Our opportunity to help shipmates by supporting the 2015 active duty 
Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society fund drive is now.  Sailors and Marines 
should be informed about the programs and services offered by the Society and 
afforded the opportunity to voluntarily donate.

4.  The Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society has kept faith with Sailors, Marines 
and their families.  During the months of March and April, please consider 
supporting this worthy effort.
