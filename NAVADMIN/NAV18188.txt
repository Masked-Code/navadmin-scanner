SUBJ/COMMAND PAY AND PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATOR PROGRAM UPDATE//

NARR/REF A IS NAVPERS 18068F, NEOCS MANUAL.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the launch of a formal 2 week course to 
train Command Pay and Personnel Administrators (CPPA) as part of the Sailor 
2025 focus to improve the quality and timeliness of pay and personnel 
services across the Navy.  Personnel Specialist (PS), Yeoman (YN), Yeoman 
(Submarines) (YNS), Navy Counselor (NC) rated personnel, those personnel in 
ratings assigned to commands without a PS, YN, YNS, or NC (E-4 through E-9), 
and designated civilian personnel are eligible to attend the CPPA course.  
The course will be held in Norfolk, VA and San Diego, CA.

2.  Attending the classroom course provides our CPPAs a greatly enhanced 
learning experience, providing interaction with subject matter experts within 
a robust curriculum.  This alternative to the existing computer based 
training (CBT) available on Navy eLearning (NeL) is a comprehensive, hands-on 
approach that will provide our CPPAs with the tools essential to initiate and 
transmit pay and personnel transactions.  A pilot session of the course was 
completed in June with feedback from participants and suggested improvements 
immediately implemented, setting a record time for getting this training out 
to the Fleet.

3.  Our priority is to ensure this training is available to Sailors 
designated as CPPAs currently in operational commands preparing for 
deployment.  The NeL course is still available to earn the A16A Navy enlisted 
classification (NEC), however the preferred path to the NEC is through this 
C-School.  Quotas are also available for civilian personnel assigned to 
commands where they are designated and function as CPPAs.  For contractor 
personnel, the primary vehicle for training will remain the CBT courses until 
further notice.

4.  Future convening dates of this course (A-500-0035) beginning on
13 August can be viewed in the Catalog of Navy Training Courses (CANTRAC), 
found at https://app.prod.cetars.training.navy.mil/cantrac/vol2.html.  Each 
class will hold approximately 24 seats, with 21 dedicated to Active 
Duty/Full-Time Support and 3 to civilian employees who are, or will function 
as a CPPA.  The quota control authority (QCA) will remain the Training 
Support Center-Hampton Roads (TSC-HR), and the primary method for quota 
requests is the Enterprise Naval Training Reservation System (eNTRS) via the 
Corporate Enterprise Training Activity Resource System (CeTARS) at 
https://main.prod.cetars.training.navy.mil/cetars/main.html.  This will 
remain the method for commands to request quotas until billets are coded with 
the A16A NEC and Sailors are distributed to those billets.  Once that has 
happened, the respective rating detailers will send those Sailors to the C-
School in route to their ultimate duty station.  We are also making plans to 
launch a Mobile Training Team that will train our CPPAs in areas outside of 
Norfolk and San Diego to include OCONUS locations.

5.  To reiterate, Sailors can obtain the A16A Command Pay and Personnel 
Administrator NEC code now by either:
    a.  Completing the NeL Command Pay and Personnel Administrator
(CPPA) Training Course (PERS2-PERS2-PAYPERS-CPPA-CPPATRAINING-V1.0),
Department of the Navy Annual Privacy Training (DON-PRIV-1.00, and Records 
Management in the DON:  Everyones Responsibility (DOR-RM-
010-1.2) as identified in reference (a), or
    b.  Completing the instructor led CPPA course (A-500-0035).

6.  Additional CPPA resources are available at
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/support/paypers/cpcresources/Pages/default2.aspx.

7.  Success of this transformation initiative requires engagement at all 
levels of leadership.  From the triad down to the deckplates, we need full 
support and utilization of the CPPA program.

8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
