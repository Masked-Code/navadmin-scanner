RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces an updated nuclear enlisted supervisor 
retention pay (ESRP) policy memorandum, reference (a).
This ESRP policy memorandum and NAVADMIN message supersedes references (b) 
and (c) effective 1 April 2023.

2.  Notable changes in reference (a) are as follows:
    a.  Clarifies a Service Member cannot exceed combined selective 
reenlistment bonus (SRB) and ESRP payments totaling $360K in a career since 1 
October 2013.
    b.  Updates the ESRP program limit to $180K and ESRP contract limit to 
$150K.
    c.  Establishes a two-option ESRP Zone 1 payment structure.
Service Members may select either a one-time lump sum payment or an 
anniversary payment (e.g., initial half up-front payment with anniversary 
installments) structure.  Payment preference must be clearly identified when 
entering the reenlistment request in the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel 
System (NSIPS).

3.  The ESRP program provides a retention incentive to senior Navy nuclear-
trained enlisted Service Members with highly specialized skills.  A detailed 
program description is outlined in reference (a) and can be found at 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Enlisted/Nuclear/Enlisted-Programs/.
The legal authority for ESRP is contained in section 331 of reference (d) and 
in reference (e).  ESRP requirements limit the program as follows:
    a.  The minimum reenlistment length is 3 years.
    b.  The maximum bonus amount for each year of additional obligated 
service (AOS) is limited to $30K as stated in reference (e).  The implication 
of this limit is that to earn a $150K bonus the minimum AOS required is 60 
months.
    c.  The maximum reenlistment lifetime bonus amount is $360K for SRB and 
ESRP contracts since 1 October 2013.
    d.  All ESRP payments must be received prior to the completion of 28 
years of service (YOS).  The implication of this limit is that any ESRP 
installment that would be due after 28 YOS will be paid in the final 
installment prior to the completion of 28 YOS.

4.  ESRP Award Multiples.  Award levels have changed since those previously 
released in reference (c).  Updated award levels are
below:
    a.  ESRP Zone 1 and Zone 2 award level (AOS computation stops at the 
completion of 16 YOS for Zone 1 and 18 YOS for Zone 2):
Rating    PNEC    Zone 1       Zone 2
ETNSS     N13S    9.5          4.5
EMNSS     N14S    8.0          4.5
MMNSS     N15S    7.5          4.5
ELTSS     N16S    7.5          4.5
ETNSW     N23S    7.5          4.5
EMNSW     N24S    8.0          4.5
MMNSW     N25S    7.5          4.5
ELTSW     N26S    7.5  (+1.5)  4.5
    b.  ESRP Zone 3 award level (AOS computation stops at the completion of 
23 YOS):
                 AOS      AOS       AOS
Rating    PNEC   1-24mos  25-36mos  37+mos
ETNSS     N13S   0.5      1.5       2.5
EMNSS     N14S   0.5      1.5       2.5
MMNSS     N15S   0.5      1.5       2.5
ELTSS     N16S   0.5      1.5       2.5
ETNSW     N23S   0.5      1.5       2.5
EMNSW     N24S   0.5      1.5       2.5
MMNSW     N25S   0.5      1.5       2.5
ELTSW     N26S   0.5      1.5       2.5

5.  Eligibility.  Only Service Members assigned with an active supervisor 
Navy enlisted classification (NEC) listed in paragraph 4 are eligible to 
reenlist for ESRP.  In addition, Service Members must hold a current security 
clearance or be in an open status for a new investigation.  ESRP requests and 
anniversary payments for personnel with special category NECs (N59X/N89X) 
will be held in abeyance pending final resolution.  Overall, ESRP eligibility 
requirements are defined in reference (a).  To encourage career progression 
and provide incentives for continued superior at-sea service, the following 
supplementary eligibility requirements remain in place for each ESRP zone:
    a.  ESRP Zone 1.  In line with reference (a), be assigned an active 
nuclear supervisor NEC (see paragraph 4).
    b.  ESRP Zone 2.  In line with reference (a), be a frocked chief or in 
the paygrade of E-7, E-8, or E-9 on the date of the ESRP Zone
2 reenlistment.
    c.  ESRP Zone 3.  In line with reference (a):
        (1) Be a frocked E-8 or in the paygrade of E-8 or E-9 on the date of 
the ESRP Zone 3 reenlistment and,
        (2) Successfully served as, currently serving as (on orders), or 
issued and accepted orders as a submarine engineering department master 
chief, nuclear aircraft carrier (CVN) major division leading chief petty 
officer, CVN reactor training division officer, or CVN reactor department 
master chief.

6.  Application Process.  To ensure the approval message is released in a 
timely manner, ESRP reenlistment requests should be submitted
35 to 120 days in advance of the desired reenlistment date.
Exceptions to this policy can be approved by the ESRP program manager on an 
individual basis.
    a.  ESRP-eligible Service Members must be recommended for reenlistment by 
their commanding officer.  The command may use the checklist (enclosure (l) 
of reference (a)) to assist in submitting the ESRP request within the NSIPS.
    b.  NSIPS is programmed to accept ESRP reenlistment requests and is the 
only method of submission.  If the command is unable to submit ESRP 
reenlistment requests due to operational commitments, then the command's 
immediate superior in command may submit the request via NSIPS.  Due to the 
transition from officer personnel information system force management (OPINS 
FORMAN) to NSIPS, the ESRP program manager can no longer submit a request for 
a Service Member or command.  Entering an ESRP request in NSIPS is similar to 
submitting a SRB request.  Other specifics to ESRP requests in NSIPS are 
stated in reference (a).

7.  Officer Programs.  ESRP entitlement for Service Members who reenlist 
after applying for an officer program will be held pending selection results.  
For limited duty officers, the application deadline is considered the 
suspense date as published in reference
(f) and future announcement messages.  For all other commissioning programs, 
the date on which the Nuclear Program Manager (OPNAV N133) approves the 
conditional release to apply for that program is the date after which 
additional ESRP entitlements will be held.

8.  Recoupment.  Repayment policy as governed by section 373 of reference 
(d), chapter 2 of reference (g), and reference (a), collectively determine 
when the repayment of the unearned portion of a bonus is required, not 
required, prohibited, and left to Secretarial discretion.  Section 373 of 
reference (d) requires repayment with certain exceptions.  As a general rule, 
repayment of any unearned portion of a bonus will be sought.  Examples of 
situations requiring repayment are provided in reference (a).

9.  Service Record Entry.  An Administrative Remarks (NAVPERS
1070/613) entry acknowledging recoupment policy via NSIPS is required in the 
record of the Service Member prior to execution of an ESRP reenlistment.  
Examples are provided in enclosure (2) of reference (a).

10.  The point of contact is the ESRP Program Manager located at OPNAV N133 
at (703) 604-5502/DSN 664 or via e-mail at nxag_n133d3(at)navy.mil or 
bullnuke(at)navy.mil.
