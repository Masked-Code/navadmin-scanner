RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces solicitation of applications from highly 
qualified and motivated E-6 through E-9 Active-Duty (AD) and Full-Time 
Support (FTS) personnel for the Fiscal Year 2023 (FY-23) Limited Duty Officer 
(LDO) and Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) programs and E-5 and above for the FY-
23 AD Warrant Officer (WO1) program.
Where conflicts with reference (a) exist, this NAVADMIN takes precedence.

2.  For the most current information concerning open designator codes, visit 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning/commissioning-programs, click 
the *Active-Duty LDO/CWO In- Service Procurement Board* link, then select 
Applicant Information link, then select current LDO and CWO designators link.

3.  Eligibility.  All applicants for the LDO, CWO and WO1 programs must have 
a security clearance prior to commissioning, must be able to complete 
operational duty screening and be worldwide assignable.
Updated policy guidance to reference (a):
    a.  All time-in-service (TIS) and time-in-grade (TIG) requirements for 
the FY-23 Active-Duty LDO and CWO In-Service Procurement Board (ISPB) will be 
computed to 1 October 2022.
    b.  TIS and TIG requirements are:
        (1) LDO:  8-14 years TIS and 1 year TIG for E-6 and above.
TIS waivers beyond 14 years will be considered up to 180 days for LDO 
applicants.  No further exceptions will be entertained.
        (2) Applicants for LDO off-ramp designators (629X, 651X, 681X and 
682X) may apply with up to 15 years of service and must understand designator 
specific off-ramp requirements and procedures defined in references (b) 
through (d).  TIS waivers will not be considered or exceptions granted for 
off-ramp designators.
        (3) Nuclear Power LDO (620X) applicants may apply with up to
16 years of service.  TIS waivers will not be considered or exceptions 
granted.
        (4) CWO3:  14 to 22 years TIS and one day TIG as an E-9 as of 2 
January 2022.  TIS waivers beyond 22 years will be considered up to 180 days 
for CWO3 applicants.  No further exceptions will be entertained.
        (5) CWO2:  14 to 20 years TIS for E-6 selected for E-7, E-7 and E-8 
(includes frocked E-9s).  TIS waivers beyond 20 years will be considered up 
to 180 days for CWO applicants.  No further exceptions will be entertained.
        (6) Due to the FY-22 Enlisted Selection Board schedule for Active E-7 
(9 August 21 - 10 September 21), First Class Petty Officers awaiting CPO 
results to apply for CWO are encouraged to apply and submit their application 
by the 1 October 2021 deadline with the following guidelines:
            (a) Commands are directed to proceed with the application process 
for these applicants as outlined in this NAVADMIN.
            (b) First Class Petty Officers awaiting CPO selection results 
must add the following statement at the top of the Commanding Officers 
endorsement: *Member is awaiting CPO results.*
PERS-803 will set aside these applications until CPO results are announced.
            (c) First Class evaluations due 15 November 2021 will be 
submitted as an addendum per guidelines of this NAVADMIN.  If selected for 
CPO and the pinning date is after 15 November 2021, the close-out eval is not 
required.  Once all of the CPO results are in, PERS-803 will integrate or 
remove those records/applications accordingly.
        (7) WO1 (784X only):  6 to 14 years TIS for E-5 and above.
TIS waivers will not be considered or exceptions granted.  Cyber Warrant 
Officer WO1 (784X) applicants refer to eligibility requirements listed in 
reference (e).
    c.  To support career progression models and maximize the return on 
investment for the Navy, TIS waivers must be submitted to 
ldocwoocm.fct(at)navy.mil before 15 July 2021 for adjudication.
Approved waivers must be submitted with the application.
    d.  Intelligence CWO (783X) applicants will be considered for selection 
into one of three Core Competency Areas (CCA):  CI/HUMINT, GEOINT/Targeting 
or OPINTEL.  In order to apply, applicants must request a primary CCA and 
those holding qualifying NECs in more than one field may request a secondary 
CCA (i.e., 783X CI/HUMINT / 783X OPINTEL).
    e.  First class petty officers serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Horn 
of Africa determined to be chief petty officer board eligible in line with 
reference (f) are also eligible for LDO if all other eligibility requirements 
are met.
    f.  Due to ongoing rating mergers or realignments, eligible Sailors are 
encouraged to apply for the designator for which they have extensive 
documented technical expertise and leadership experience in their enlisted 
service records, regardless of current rating.  However, special attention 
should be given to the guidance in chapter 7, subparagraph 9c of reference 
(a).
    g.  Applicants in designators outlined in reference (a) requiring to meet 
color perception requirements shall have test results documented as a 
telephone consult (T-Con) in Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology 
Application (AHLTA) within the past 12 months and provide hard copy or have 
test results documented on SF-600 and submitted with application.
    h.  Applicants must maintain eligibility throughout the selection and 
promotion process.  Applicants who are deemed ineligible after submitting an 
application must be declared ineligible by their current Commanding 
Officer/Officer in Charge (CO/OIC).  A sample Removal of Recommendation 
format is located at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-
Planning/commissioning-programs.  Click the *Active-Duty LDO/CWO In-Service 
Procurement Board* link, then select Applicant Information, then select LDO 
and CWO In-Service Procurement Board to download the form (See Sample Letter 
of Abeyance or Removal of Recommendation).  Nuclear Power LDO (620X) 
applicants who are deemed ineligible must be declared ineligible by their 
current CO via letter to the Nuclear Program Manager (OPNAV N133).

4.  Appraisal Boards.  (Not required for Nuclear Power LDO 620X) Active duty 
interview appraisal boards will be coordinated and approved by the CO/OIC and 
consist of three Active Duty Naval Officers (LDOs or CWOs preferred).  Every 
effort (including teleconference media) shall be made to ensure the senior 
board member is from the LDO or CWO designator family for which the applicant 
is applying.
    a.  It is highly recommended that the senior member of the interview 
panel for applicants applying for LDO is an in-designator commander (CDR) or 
above.  If not available, a LDO CDR or above in another designator can serve 
in this capacity with at least one board member from the designator family.  
Officers who were CDR or CAPT LDOs that reverted to another designator via 
Without Board Action (WOBA) process can serve as the senior member.  In 
communities where there are no longer senior LDOs within the community, a CDR 
or CAPT from the parent community can act as the senior board member, e.g., a 
Supply Corps (3100) CDR or CAPT for Supply (651X) applicants.
    b.  For CWO applicants, the senior member of the interview panel shall be 
a LCDR or above with at least one in-designator CWO4 or CWO5 as a board 
member.  If a LCDR or above is not available, a CWO5 can serve as the senior 
board member as long as the other members are junior (CWO3, CWO4).
    c.  Minimum grade requirements for board members are Lieutenant or CWO3.
    d.  Only three interview appraisals are authorized to be submitted for 
each applicant.
    e.  Interview Appraisal Board member preparation for applicant appraisal 
boards is an important part of a well-run board.  Review of the applicant 
application, review of discrete requirements for the applicant designator, 
having well thought out questions on technical expertise, leadership and 
knowledge of the designator they are applying for to include future career 
path if selected are all great examples of board member preparation.
   f.  The technical ability and potential block on the interview appraisal 
sheet must be marked for LDO and CWO candidates.  Only the current version of 
the interviewer appraisal sheet will be accepted.
Interviewer appraisal sheet is located at
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning/commissioning-programs.  Click 
the *Active-Duty LDO/CWO In-Service Procurement Board* link, then select 
Applicant Information, then select LDO and CWO In-Service Procurement Board 
to download the form.

5.  Application Submission.  Communication to the board (application, 
addendums, etc.) should originate from the applicant via their CO.  However, 
it is acceptable for the command to submit an applicants package on their 
behalf, provided that the package has been endorsed by the CO and the 
applicant has been provided a copy of their entire package prior to 
submission.  Information received that is not under the cover letter of the 
applicant (e.g., third party correspondence) and endorsed by the command, or 
not received by the MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) by the established 
deadline(s) will not be presented to the board.
    a.  All applications must be submitted along with a command screened

    b.  Each applicant and CO/OIC must ensure applications/addendums are 
complete and accurate.  Incomplete applications could result in non-
selection.  Applications must be signed by the CO/OIC of the applicant or 
*Acting*.  Addendums can be signed *By direction* if the CO or OIC is 
unavailable.
    c.  As previously stated, all applicants must possess a security 
clearance prior to commission.  Refer to reference (a), (chapters 2 and 7) 
for security clearance information, program overview and eligibility 
criteria.
    d.  CO/OIC endorsements must contain the following statement:
*Applicant meets all requirements outlined in OPNAVINST 1420.1B, NAVADMIN 
116/21, the physical fitness standards of OPNAVINST 6110.1J, and is worldwide 
assignable.*  The endorsement must clearly identify the command, and must be 
signed by the CO/OIC, and include the CO or OICs command point of contact 
information.
    e.  Applicants must ensure a copy of their most recent periodic 
evaluation is included in the application or provided via addendum for board 
review and continuity if they are not already in Official Military Personnel 
File (OMPF).
    f.  Applicants are not required to include an obligatory service 
statement to remain on active duty as part of their personal statement.
    g.  Applicants currently serving in an IAMM, GSA or OSA assignment may 
have their application endorsed by the field commander.  Field commanders 
must obtain parent command endorsement prior to submission.  A sample format 
is located at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning/commissioning-
programs.  Click the *Active-Duty LDO/CWO In-Service Procurement
