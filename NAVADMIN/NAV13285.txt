Rmks/1.  This NAVADMIN provides Navy-specific direction to  immediately execute the requirement for 
secure internet protocol router network (SIPRNET) Public Key Enforcement (PKE) in accordance with Ref 
A NLT 1 January 2014.  This message applies to all ashore, Navy owned,  operated, or controlled SIPRNET 
connected networks.  Ashore system owners shall implement PKE immediately.  This message 
supersedes PAR 3 of REF B.  Exceptions will be kept to an absolute minimum and will be 
approved/disapproved by DDCIO(N). Requests will only be considered with an accompanying POAM for 
compliance.

2.  A comprehensive implementation plan for afloat commands and Platform IT (PIT) will be published 
SEPCOR.  OPNAV N2/N6 is working  with platform resource sponsors and the acquisition community to  
promulgate an executable, achievable timeline.

3.  Action.  In order to harden SIPRNET, it is vital that the  following actions occur:
    (a) 100% token issuance throughout the Military and civilian workforce;
    (b) Mandatory enforcement of cryptographic login (CLO) via SIPRNET token.
Enforcement means users have no other option to login other than the token, eliminate 
userid/password logon;
    (c) elimination of all userid/password accounts;
    (d) reporting PKE status to CTF 1010 (NETWARCOM) until compliant IAW ref c.

4.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or  superseded.

5.  Released by Vice Admiral Ted N. Branch, Deputy Chief of Naval  Operations, Information Dominance, 
OPNAV N2N6.//
