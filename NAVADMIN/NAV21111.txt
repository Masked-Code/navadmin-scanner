RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels references (a) and (b). 
 
2.  Per reference (c), the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Information 
Officer (CIO) will decommission the Commercial Virtual Remote (CVR) 
Environment on June 15, 2021.  As a result of CVR decommissioning, the Navy 
will utilize a single Microsoft Office 365 (M365) collaboration and 
productivity cloud named FLANK SPEED.  It provides a more secure operating 
environment and, over time, will deliver additional tools to support a more 
productive Navy workforce.  Per reference (d), Navy active CVR users will 
gain access to FLANK SPEED on June 8, 2021.  NMCI O365 users will begin 
phased migration on June 8, 2021 and be complete by July 2021.  Follow-on 
user phasing will be coordinated with Echelon II CIOs to meet mission 
requirements as network performance allows. 
 
3.  There is no DoD or Navy enterprise plan to save the data located on 
CVR.  The entire CVR environment will be disabled and data will no longer be 
retrievable as of June 16, 2021.  Users are responsible for downloading data 
they wish to retain from CVR and saving it to a Navy location (e.g., user 
document folders, user H: drive, FLANK SPEED OneDrive or NMCI M365 OneDrive) 
no later than June 15, 2021. 
    a.  The FLANK SPEED Authority to Operate (ATO) permits processing and 
storage of controlled unclassified information (CUI) data types, as listed in 
DoDI 5200.48, up to moderate impact Personally Identifiable Information 
(PII).  Per reference (e), all policies for handling permitted CUI data types 
still apply. 
        1) The following data type exceptions are not authorized on FLANK 
SPEED: 
           (a) Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
information, to include Protected Health Information (PHI) 
           (b) Navy Nuclear Propulsion Information (NNPI) 
           (c) Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data 
        2) Authorization for data types in paragraph 3.a.1 are planned as 
part of future capability releases.  Users will be notified when these data 
types are authorized.  Current Navy network users routinely working with 
these data types will not migrate to FLANK SPEED until authorized. 
    b.  The FLANK SPEED portal provides directions on how to download and 
save data stored in CVR and other useful information and is located at: https 
://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs/OPNAV/N2N6/DDCION/FlankSpeed/. 
 
4.  Access to FLANK SPEED. 
    a.  Will not initially be available from personal mobile devices.  This 
will be a future capability. 
    b.  Will be available from Navy Non-classified Internet Protocol Router 
Network (NIPRnet) and commercial internet with the following stipulations: 
        1) Requires Common Access Card (CAC) authentication. 
        2) Government furnished desktops/laptops will have full functionality 
when accessing from the NIPRnet, whether from the office or via Virtual 
Private Network (VPN) over a commercial internet. 
        3) Access from commercial internet, whether by government furnished 
or personally owned desktops/laptops, requires the use of a web browser. Data 
uploads and downloads will not be allowed. 
 
5.  All Navy Commanding Officers should ensure that their commands understand 
the actions they must take before CVR is decommissioned. 
 
6.  Request widest dissemination.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until 
16 
June 2021.
