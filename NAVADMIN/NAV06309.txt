SUBJ/MILITARY FAMILY APPRECIATION MONTH//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  AS WE BEGIN THE HOLIDAY SEASON, MANY WILL PAUSE
TO REFLECT AND GIVE THANKS FOR THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE AND THE
ACCOMPLISHMENTS THEY HAVE ACHIEVED.  TIED TO THESE ARE THE MILITARY
FAMILY.
2.  WE ALL KNOW AND APPRECIATE THE SACRIFCES OUR MILITARY FAMILIES
MAKE.  WE ALL UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT FAMILIES ARE TO OUR PERSONAL
READINESS.  WE ALL KNOW THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE LEAN ON THEM, THE
DEGREE TO WHICH WE VALUE THEIR SUPPORT, THEIR COUNSEL, AND THEIR
LOVE.  WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT WE COULD NOT DO OUR PART IN THIS LONG
WAR WITHOUT THEM.  BUT WE MUST ALSO TAKE TIME TO RECOGNIZE THEIR
COLLECTIVE IMPACT ON THE NAVY AT LARGE.
3.  THE TRUTH IS, OUR FAMILIES DO NOT JUST MAKE IT EASIER FOR US AS
INDIVIDUALS TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY.  THEY FIND WAYS -- THROUGH THE
OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM, FAMILYLINE, THE FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS,
AND A HOST OF OTHER EFFORTS -- TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE NAVY FAMILY AS WELL.  BY HELPING EACH OTHER,
AND BY BUILDING STRONG COMMUNITIES, OUR FAMILIES MAKE IT EASIER FOR
THE NAVY ITSELF TO ANSWER THE NATIONS CALL.  IN THIS CRITICAL TIME,
OUR NAVY FAMILIES ARE PLAYING A VITAL ROLE IN THE DEFENSE OF OUR
NATION.
4.  TO ALL OF THEM, WHATEVER THEIR RELATION, I SAY THANK YOU.  THANK
YOU FOR STANDING BY YOUR SAILOR.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.  AND
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THE SACRIFICE OF MILITARY SERVICE WITH SUCH
GRACE AND DIGNITY.  I AM GRATEFUL, AND YOUR NAVY IS GRATEFUL.
5.  TO THOSE OF US IN RANKS, PLEASE JOIN ME THIS MONTH IN EXPRESSING
GRATITUDE TO NAVY FAMILIES EVERYWHERE.  TAKE TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY
DAYS TO RECOGNIZE EVERYTHING OUR FAMILIES DO TO MAKE WHAT WE DO
POSSIBLE.  THEY CERTAINLY DESERVE IT.
6.  ADM MIKE MULLEN, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
