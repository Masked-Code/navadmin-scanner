RMKS/1. THIS MESSAGE ANNOUNCES THE 2008 CALENDAR FOR AMERICA (CFA), 
WHICH LISTS THE NAVY’S LARGE-SCALE CONUS OUTREACH EVENTS FOR THE COMING  
YEAR.
2. KEY PLANNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS MET IN MILLINGTON, TN, 18 OCT 2007  TO 
PLAN THE DATES AND STRATEGY FOR CFA 2008, TO INCLUDE NAVY WEEKS,  FLEET 
WEEKS, MARITIME STRATEGY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COUNTRY, BLUE ANGELS  
AIR SHOWS, DIVERSITY EVENTS, SHIP COMMISSIONINGS, AND KEY RECRUITING 
EVOLUTIONS.
3. THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS SET FORTH HIS INTENT FOR CFA 2008 AS
FOLLOWS:
A. ENDSTATE: ENHANCED PUBLIC AWARENESS, ESPECIALLY IN NON-FLEET 
CONCENTRATION AREAS, OF NAVY MISSIONS, PERSONNEL AND POLICIES,  CREATED 
THROUGH A COORDINATED AND FOCUSED DEMONSTRATION OF EQUIPMENT  
CAPABILITIES, MUSIC PERFORMANCES, PUBLIC SPEAKING EVENTS AND ONE-ON-ONE 
ENGAGEMENT  OF MEDIA AND CIVILIAN INFLUENCERS BY NAVY PERSONNEL AT 
EVERY LEVEL OF LEADERSHIP, AND MEASURABLE TO ENSURE MOST EFFECTIVE USE 
OF OUR  RESOURCES.
B. KEY TASKS: ESTABLISH CALENDAR OF EVENTS THAT LEVERAGES EXISTING 
COMMUNITY EVENTS, IN WHICH THE NAVY MAY PARTICIPATE, TO OPTIMIZE NAVY 
PERSONNEL ENGAGEMENT WITH MEDIA AND CIVILIAN INFLUENCERS.
PARTICIPATION SHALL INCLUDE SURFACE, AIR, SUBSURFACE, NAVY INSTALLATION 
AND NAVAL SPECIAL WARFARE EQUIPMENT, FACILITIES AND PERSONNEL, 
INCLUDING THE BLUE ANGELS, NAVY BAND, RECRUITING COMMAND AND NASCAR. 
RECRUITING GOALS ARE A SIGNIFICANT, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVE, ASPECT OF NAVY 
OUTREACH AND SHOULD BE INTEGRATED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE WITH 
OVERALL OUTREACH EFFORTS. DIVERSITY EVENTS SHALL BE A KEY CONSIDERATION 
IN DETERMINING WHAT EVENTS TO ESTABLISH AS NAVY WEEKS; HOWEVER, 
ACTIVITIES SHALL CONSIDER OVERALL MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.
