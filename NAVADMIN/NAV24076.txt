RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Department of Defense (DoD) Drug Demand 
Reduction Program (DDRP) solicitation for nomination for the Secretary of 
Defense Fulcrum Shield Award.  The Fulcrum Shield Award was established by 
DoD to promote community drug awareness efforts and is presented annually to 
the best youth-based drug demand reduction program that is affiliated with 
any military service, National Guard, defense agency, or DoD field activity. 
Nominations cover the period of Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) (1 October 2023 
through 1 September 2024).  The Navy is permitted three nominations for FY24. 
 
2.  To be eligible for the award, the nominated organization must have: 
    a.  School age participates (ages 5-18) who have contributed to

National Guard Bureau, defense agency, or DoD field activity. 
    c.  Demonstrated ability to reach populations outside the organizations 
membership with the anti-drug message.

3.  Nominations for the award must recognize innovative, creative digital, 
and traditional community outreach efforts during FY24, to include 
organizational efforts during Red Ribbon Week.  The award is designed to 
recognize the best youth anti-drug outreach group that has a military 
affiliation.  Substantive criteria on which the nominations will be judged 
will include community outreach efforts that bring organizations and 
individuals together around the shared purpose of preventing drug misuse.

the community).

year.
