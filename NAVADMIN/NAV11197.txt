SUBJ/RESTRUCTURE OF THE NAVY ADVANCEMENT EXAMINATION// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES A CHANGE TO THE NAVY ENLISTED EXAMINATION 
STRUCTURE.  THE PRIMARY INTENT OF THIS CHANGE IS TO INCREASE EXAM VALIDITY BY 
GIVING GREATER FOCUS TO TECHNICAL RATING KNOWLEDGE.  NEW EXAM STRUCTURE WILL 
INCREASE THE EMPHASIS ON RATING-SPECIFIC TECHNICAL QUESTIONS.
COMMENCING WITH THE SEPTEMBER 2012 NAVY-WIDE EXAMINATIONS, THE OVERALL NUMBER 
OF EXAM QUESTIONS WILL DECREASE FROM 200 TO 175.  ADDITIONALLY, EXAM STRUCTURE 
FOR ALL PAYGRADES WILL CONSIST OF 25 PROFESSIONAL MILITARY KNOWLEDGE (PMK) 
QUESTIONS AND 150 RATING TECHNICAL QUESTIONS.  THIS NEW EXAM STRUCTURE WILL 
IMPROVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE GREATER RATING KNOWLEDGE IN COMPARISON 
TO A SAILOR'S PEERS.
2.  EXAM CONSTRUCTION CHANGE SUMMARY BY PAYGRADE:
    CURRENT EXAM MODEL                  NEW EXAM MODEL
    RATING-SPECIFIC/PMK    PAYGRADE     RATING-SPECIFIC/PMK
       150/50                E4            150/25
       135/65                E5            150/25
       115/85                E6            150/25
       100/100               E7            150/25
3.  PROFESSIONAL MILITARY KNOWLEDGE REMAINS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE 
ADVANCEMENT EXAM.  THE FOCUS OF PMK EXAM QUESTIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, LEADERSHIP CONTINUUM, AND GENERAL MILITARY TRAINING.
4.  THESE CHANGES WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE CURRENT ENLISTED EXAMINATION 
ADMINISTRATION PROCESS.
THE CURRENT FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE (FMS) REMAINS UNCHANGED.  EXAM BIBLIOGRAPHIES 
WILL REFLECT THE NEW EXAM STRUCTURE AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR PREPARATION SIX 
MONTHS PRIOR TO ADMINISTRATION.
