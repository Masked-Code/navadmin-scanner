RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels references (a) and (b) and announces the Rapid 
Assess and Incorporate Software Engineering (RAISE) process is approved for 
use in Development Security Operations (DevSecOps) environments to accelerate 
the Risk Management Framework (RMF) process defined by reference (c).  To 
deliver warfighting capability and improve cyber readiness for those 
applications hosted on the Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise 
Services (CANES), the Overmatch Software Armory (OSA) DEVSECOPS pipeline is 
available for use with RAISE.  The Shore Tactical Assured Command and Control 
(STACC) DEVSECOPS pipeline capability will come online in the summer of CY21.

2.  The RAISE process streamlines and accelerates the RMF process by 
employing automation, cyber verification tools, and Cybersecurity Tech 
Authority -certified DevSecOps pipelines to ensure developed software is 
secure.  Use of RAISE certifies DevSecOps environments and authorizes 
software applications built and operated within those environments.

3.  As available, specific RAISE implementation guidance for CANES, STACC and 
other systems of record, as well as updates on new capabilities, will be 
promulgated via Fleet Advisory Messages (FAMs).  RAISE guidance is available 
in the RMF Process Guide and RAISE Playbook at the following location - https 
://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs/OPNAV/N2N6/DDCION/RAISE/SitePages/Home.aspx.

4.  Effective January 2021, all programs with new software development starts 
and/or software upgrades intended for use on CANES (AFLOAT) platforms 
currently operating with Agile Core Services (ACS) are required to use this 
approach.  Programs should review the RAISE guidance contained in the RMF 
Process Guide and RAISE Playbook.

5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.

6.  Released by VADM Jeffrey E. Trussler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations 
for Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.
