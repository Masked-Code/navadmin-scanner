RMKS/1.  THE HIGH YEAR TENURE (HYT) PROGRAM IS AN IMPORTANT 
COMPONENT OF THE NAVY STRATEGY TO RETAIN TOP PERFORMERS IN THE 
ACTIVE AND RESERVE FORCE.  AS PART OF A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WITH 
THE FLEET, REVISIONS TO REF A PROVED NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THIS 
STRATEGY BY RELIEVING PRESSURE ON OTHER FORCE SHAPING PROGRAMS AND 
INCENTIVIZING PROFESSIONAL GROWTH AND RETENTION OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
NAVY'S TOP PERFORMERS.  REVISIONS TO REF (A) WILL INCORPORATE ACTIVE 
AND RESERVE POLICY, AND WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE 1 JULY 2012.  REF B 
WILL BE CANCELLED EFFECTIVE 1 JULY 2012.  

2.  THE REVISED HYT ARTICLE REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM THE 
PREVIOUS POLICY AND SHOULD BE READ IN ITS ENTIRETY.  SIGNIFICANT 
CHANGES TO REF A, AS DETAILED IN PARAGRAPHS 3 AND 4, INCLUDE 
REDUCTION IN HYT LENGTH OF SERVICE (LOS) GATES FOR ACTIVE AND FULL 
TIME SUPPORT (FTS) E2 AND E3 PERSONNEL, ELIMINATION OF PASS NOT 
ADVANCED (PNA) EXCEPTION FOR E3 PERSONNEL TO REMAIN ON ACTIVE DUTY 
FOR EIGHT YEARS, ESTABLISHMENT OF POLICY FOR CANCELLATION OF HYT 
WAIVERS WHEN APPROVAL BASIS IS NOT MET, AND GUIDANCE ON HYT IMPACT 
FOR SAILORS REDUCED IN RATE (RIR).  COMMANDS SHALL ENSURE PERSONNEL 
AFFECTED BY REVISED HYT LIMITS AND SEPARATION TIMELINES RECEIVE 
COUNSELING ON THE PROVISIONS THAT WILL TAKE EFFECT 1 JULY 2012.

PASSING A NAVY-WIDE ADVANCEMENT EXAMINATION WILL NO LONGER EXTEND AN 
E3 SAILOR BEYOND THE STANDARD E3 LOS GATE.  E4 THROUGH E9 HYT LOS 
GATES REMAIN UNCHANGED, ALONG WITH THE PROVISION THAT ACTIVE DUTY 
AND FTS REENLISTMENTS AND/OR EXTENSIONS MAY NOT BE EXECUTED THAT 
EXCEED PAYGRADE HYT LIMITS.

THE REVISED HYT LOS GATES, OR FOR SAILORS PREVIOUSLY REDUCED IN
