SUBJ/SHIPS SERVICEMAN RATING NAME CHANGE TO RETAIL SERVICES SPECIALIST//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Ships Serviceman (SH) rating name change 
to the Retail Services Specialist (RS) rating.  The rating change will 
directly translate the skills and expertise of the work performed by the 
Sailors in the rating to work performed in the civilian sector.  
Additionally, this change will increase professional alignment with civilian 
employees, better representing the functions performed by Sailors within the 
rating.

2.  In support of the Sailor 2025 efforts, Rating Modernization continues to 
redefine career fields, offer more career choices and expand professional 
development opportunities.  The rating progression from four specialty 
ratings of Barber, Laundryman, Cobbler and Tailor to SH and now RS is a 
natural one.  This name change is in keeping with the tradition in the Navy 
of defining the occupation of a Sailor in contemporary terms that better 
define the tasks to be performed and the skills needed to perform them.

3.  The source rating SH will be revised to RS on the following affected Navy 
Enlisted Classification (NEC) codes:  L39A, L40A, S00A, S010, S12A and 756A.

4.  Those Sailors currently in the SH rating will automatically convert to 
the RS rating on 1 October 2019.  This change is administrative and will not 
affect the current billet structure, personnel inventory or career paths. 
Requests for conversion from Sailors or commands are not required.

5.  The rating badge of crossed key and quill is retained for the RS rating.

6.  RS candidates may be taking SH exams, but the advancement authorized 
rating will be RS.  The first Navy-Wide Advancement Examinations for the RS 
rating will be administered as follows:
    a.  E4/5/6 Active Duty cycle - September 2020
    b.  E4/5/6 SELRES cycle -  February 2021
    c.  E7 Active Duty cycle - January 2021
    d.  E7 SELRES cycle - February 2021

7.  The point of contact for this matter is CDR Nicholas Ulmer, Supply 
Enlisted Community Manager, at (901) 874-2823/DSN 882 or via e-mail at 
nicholas.ulmer(at)navy.mil.
