RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces a temporary exception to policy (ETP) by the 
Department of Defense (DoD) to Post 9-11 GI Bill transfer of education 
benefits (TEB) eligibility.

2.  Effective immediately and retroactive to 12 July 2018, reference
(a) defers full implementation of eligibility changes in references
(b) and (c) until 12 July 2019 for members who have served at least
10 years.  All other TEB policies and procedures remain in effect.

3.  Members with at least 10 years of service in the armed forces who are 
unable to serve 4 additional years due to statute or standard policy (DoD or 
Service) at the time of their TEB application and agree to serve the maximum 
time authorized by that statute or policy, are eligible to transfer education 
benefits to dependents until 11 July 2019.
    a.  Sailors whose TEB applications were previously rejected must reapply 
for TEB to be considered for approval.
    b.  All Sailors applying or reapplying for TEB who have not previously 
completed the online self-service Statement of Understanding implemented in 
reference (d) must first complete it at 
https://myeducation.netc.navy.mil/webta/home.html#nbb.
    c.  Enlisted Sailors within 4 years of high year tenure (HYT) must have a 
hard or soft end of active obligated service/end of service reflected in the 
Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System electronic service record (ESR) 
that coincides with the month and year of their HYT before applying for TEB.
    d.  Officers within 4 years of the statutory limit for their current 
rank, or who have twice failed to select for promotion to the next rank, will 
have an Obligation End Date (OED) established that coincides with the last 
day of the month prior to their mandatory retirement or separation date.
    e.  Selected Reserve (SELRES) officers serving in tenure-limited billets 
will have an OED established 4 years from their TEB application date or to 
their statutory limit, as applicable.
Officers whose projected rotation date precedes the OED must apply to remain 
in the SELRES by participating in the applicable billet application and 
selection process.  Officers not selected for a billet to continue in the 
SELRES must contact the Navy Reserve point of contact identified in paragraph 
6c to request OED adjustment to coincide with the last day of the last month 
of their current assignment.
    f.  Members undergoing medical board processing must receive final 
determination of their status prior to applying for TEB.  If not retainable, 
Active-Duty and Full-Time Support (FTS) members must provide their final 
separation message to Navy Personnel Command GI Bill Programs Branch (PERS 
311), via MyNavy Career Center.  SELRES members must provide their 
documentation to Commander, Navy Reserve Forces Command Post-9/11 GI Bill 
Manager (N1C2).  The documentation must indicate their separation date and 
the TEB application must be submitted before separation and expiration of 
this ETP.
    g.  Sailors submitting TEB applications on or after 12 July 2019 will be 
subject to TEB policy contained in references (b) through (d).  This includes 
the restriction of TEB eligibility to those with no more than 16 years of 
service.  Sailors approaching 16 years of service must take action prior to 
12 July 2019 to preserve the ability to transfer benefits or it will be lost.

4.  Enlisted Sailors subject to this ETP may extend to meet the TEB obligated 
service, subject to eligibility criteria in reference (e).
Extensions must be reflected in the ESR prior to submitting a TEB request.

5.  Members approved for TEB must remain in the armed forces until the OED.  
Failure to complete the service obligation will result in family member 
ineligibility for benefits, or if benefits have been used, all monies paid to 
dependents will be considered an overpayment by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs subject to recoupment.  Exceptions that do not result in loss of TEB 
eligibility are described in reference (b), enclosure 3, paragraphs
3g(2)(a) through 3g(2)(h).

6.  Points of contact:
    a.  OPNAV N127 Policy:  Mr. Jim Johnson, (703)604-5256/DSN 664 or via e-
mail at james.p.johnson(at)navy.mil.
    b.  Active-Duty and FTS Sailors may submit inquiries to MyNavy Career 
Center at 1-833-330-6622 or via e-mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil.

Command (N1C2) at 1-800-621-8853 or via e-mail at 
cnrfc_post911gibill(at)navy.mil.

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or
