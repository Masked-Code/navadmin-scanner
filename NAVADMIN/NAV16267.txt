2.  The Lateral Transfer/Redesignation Board was extremely competitive.  Each 
record that was presented to the board was carefully reviewed and the best 
and fully qualified were chosen.

3.  Quota constraints for junior year groups (13 through 16) were especially 
tight, thus the demand signal far exceeded the supply pool.  Many quality 
applicants were identified by the board but could not be selected due to 
quota constraints of either the outgoing community or the gaining community.  
Applicants who were not selected this year should apply again while 
sustaining superior performance and bolstering their record for desired 
communities.

4.  As always, competition for redesignation was keen and every community had 
a pool of highly qualified candidates.  Eligible officers not initially 
selected, and who specifically requested to be reviewed by communities other 
than their first or second choice, were subsequently reviewed by all other 
communities.  Those officers tentatively selected for communities not 
initially requested will be notified via official correspondence and offered 
the opportunity to redesignate.

5.  This message is not authority to deliver change of designator letters to 
the selectees.  Officers who are promotion selectees should contact their 
current detailer to discuss redesignation timing.  Commander, Navy Personnel 
Command (COMNAVPERSCOM) (PERS 803), upon notification by COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS 
4) that the selectees have been made available to their new communities, will 
forward redesignation letters or appointment acceptance and oath of office 
(NAVPERS 1000/4), as applicable to selectees.  Officers who are not promotion 
selectees and who are not under orders can expect assignment to a new billet 
appropriate to their new designation within six months.  If an officer is 
currently under orders and transfers prior to notification by COMNAVPERSCOM 
(PERS 4), member must execute orders under current designator and must 
complete 12 months at the new assignment, unless a shorter tour is prescribed 
(tours in excess of one year will be with the concurrence of the gaining 
community), prior to redesignation.

6.  The following are exceptions to the above:
    a.  Surface Warfare Officers (11xx) who are under orders to department 
head school may not lateral transfer until completion of initial department 
head tour.
    b.  Aviation Officers (131x and 132x) shall not be permitted to lateral 
transfer until completion of active duty service obligation, expiration of 
aviation career continuation pay contract, or planned rotation date (PRD), as 
determined by Aviation OCM (BUPERS-313). Aviation officers in operational 
flying billets (billet designator XXX1 or XXX2) will not be permitted to 
redesignate until vacating the billet, typically at PRD.  BUPERS-313 
authorizes redesignation timing.
    c.  Selectees for Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer (151x) who are 
presently designated 131x or 132x and have not completed a second sea tour or 
aviation department head tour may be delayed assignment to 151x billets until 
the completion of an applicable second sea and or aviation department head 
tour, as determined by COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS 43).

7.  Commanding officers shall:
    a.  Ensure officers selected for promotion within their current community 
do not accept redesignation before their promotion date.
    b.  Notify COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS 803) within 30 days of release of this 
message of any selectee that does not desire to accept 
transfer/redesignation.

8.  The next Lateral Transfer/Redesignation Board will be held in June 2017. 
Previous applications are not retained, non-selectees from previous boards 
must submit a new application for consideration.  A future NAVADMIN will 
stipulate eligibility requirements, application procedures, and deadlines.

9.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
