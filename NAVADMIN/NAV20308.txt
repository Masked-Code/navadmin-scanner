4.  Selections are conditional upon the selectee remaining fully eligible in 
all respects, meeting physical qualifications for commissioning as determined 
by the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED), and assignment by Naval 
Service Training Command (NSTC) to an approved Naval Reserve Officers 
Training Corps (NROTC) affiliated university based upon an official degree 
plan and acceptance letter from the university.  Upon completion of an NSTC 
approved baccalaureate degree program, selectees will receive appointments as 
ensigns, USN.

5.  Commanding officers should take the following actions:
    a.  Notify selectees and alternates of their selection and ensure they 
receive a copy of this message.
    b.  Notify NSTC N92 Selection and Placement (N92/STA-21) via message no 
later than 11 December 2020 of any selectee or alternate who does not desire 
to participate in the program.
    c.  Immediately report to NSTC (N92/STA-21) all conditions/circumstances 
that may disqualify a selectee or alternate from participating in the STA-21 
program via e-mail at pnsc_sta21(at)navy.mil.

6.  Selectees and alternates should take the following actions:
    a.  Complete a physical examination for a training program leading to a 
commission in the unrestricted line, nurse corps, or civil engineering corps, 
as applicable, in accordance with references (a) and (b) at a military 
treatment facility.  Note that many commissioning standards exceed the 
enlisted standards required to remain on active duty.
    b.  Ensure copies of completed physicals, Report of Medical History 
(DD2807-1), and Report of Medical Examination (DD2808), including Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus results from a test taken after 1 January 2020, are 
submitted no later than 15 January 2021
to:
Naval Service Training Command
Attn:  N92/STA-21
250 Dallas Street Suite A
Pensacola Florida 32508-5268
Aviation option selectees/alternates must have flight physicals uploaded 
directly into Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office by a flight surgeon, and 
submitted to Naval Aerospace Medical Institute.
The selectees/alternates must be certified as qualified or have a waiver 
recommended by Naval Medicine Operation Training Center.  All required 
physical forms can be downloaded from the STA-21 homepage at https://www.sta-
21.navy.mil.  Commands should not forward physical forms directly to BUMED.
    c.  Send acceptance letters from no more than three NROTC host or NROTC 
cross-town affiliated universities to the NSTC address listed above.  
Application to more than one university is advisable.
Selectees will begin the STA-21 program with attendance at the Naval Science 
Institute (NSI) no later than 16 February 2021.
    d.  Send an official degree plan from an NROTC host or NROTC cross-town 
affiliated university where they have been accepted.
Degree plans must cover the time actually attending college.  Degree plans of 
selectees should begin with the summer term 2021.  All STA-
21 selectees will be required to attend the NSI enroute to their assigned 
university.

7.  Alternates:  Each alternate must complete the same actions outlined in 
paragraph 6 of this message.  If a primary selectee declines participation in 
the program, is determined to be not physically qualified, or otherwise 
becomes ineligible for continuation in the program prior to executing orders, 
a qualified alternate will be selected.  This notification often comes at the 
last minute, therefore, alternates who desire participation in the
STA-21 program need to be completed with the actions listed above when 
notified.

8.  The deadline for required degree plans and college admission 
documentation is 15 January 2021.  It is in the best interest of each 
selectee and alternate to submit verification of eligibility criteria as soon 
as possible to expedite university assignment and release of permanent change 
of station orders.  Selectees will not be ordered to NSI enroute to their 
assigned NROTC University until all conditions outlined in paragraph 6 have 
been met.

9.  Points of contact are Mrs. Anna Duvall at (850) 452-9433/DSN 922 or via 
e-mail at anna.duvall(at)navy.mil or Mr. Eric Hodge at (850) 452-9563/DSN 922
