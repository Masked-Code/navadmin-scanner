MSGID/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/N00/MAY// SUBJ/ADMIRAL DONALD L. 
PILLING CONDOLENCE// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  IT IS WITH GREAT SADNESS THAT 
I SHARE THE NEWS OF THE PASSING OF AN OUTSTANDING NAVY LEADER ON 
MEMORIAL DAY, ADMIRAL DONALD L. PILLING, USN(RET).
2.  ADMIRAL PILLING'S 35-YEAR ACTIVE-DUTY CAREER WAS EXCEPTIONAL BY ANY 
MEASURE AND HE WAS KNOWN BY THOSE WHO HAD THE PLEASURE OF SERVING WITH 
HIM AS A VISIONARY LEADER, A BRILLIANT SCHOLAR, AND A TRUE OFFICER AND 
GENTLEMAN. FOLLOWING HIS GRADUATION FROM THE UNITED STATES NAVAL 
ACADEMY IN 1965 AS A TRIDENT SCHOLAR, HE BECAME AN EXTRAORDINARY 
SURFACE WARFARE OFFICER WHO COMMANDED WITH DISTINCTION AT EVERY LEVEL.  
A DESTROYER SAILOR, PILLING COMMANDED USS DAHLGREN (DDG 43), DESTROYER 
SQUADRON 26, CRUISER GROUP 12, USS SARATOGA BATTLE GROUP, UNITED STATES 
SIXTH FLEET, AND NAVAL STRIKING AND SUPPORT FORCES SOUTHERN EUROPE.  
HIS SHORE ASSIGNMENTS INCLUDED MULTIPLE TOURS ON THE STAFF OF THE CHIEF 
OF NAVAL OPERATIONS AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY STAFF WHERE HE DEVELOPED 
THE NAVY'S FIVE-YEAR DEFENSE PLAN AS WELL AS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR 
FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES.  ULTIMATELY, BECAUSE OF 
HIS STELLAR PERFORMANCE AT SEA AND ASHORE, ADMIRAL PILLING ACHIEVED THE 
RANK OF ADMIRAL AND BECAME OUR THIRTIETH VICE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS 
BEFORE RETIRING IN 2000. 
3.  IN ADDITION TO HIS OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, ADMIRAL PILLING WAS A 
HIGHLY REGARDED ACADEMIC, HAVING BEEN AWARDED HIS PH.D. IN MATHEMATICS 
FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE WHEN HE COMPLETED HIS DISSERTATION 
ENTITLED "THE ALGEBRA OF OPERATORS FOR REGULAR EVENTS."  AN 
ACCOMPLISHED AUTHOR, HE WAS PUBLISHED IN MATHEMATICAL AND PROFESSIONAL 
JOURNALS, WITH HIS MOST NOTABLE WORK BEING THE MONOGRAPH, "COMPETITION 
IN DEFENSE PROCUREMENT," WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN 1989 BY THE BROOKINGS 
INSTITUTION. 
4.  UPON RETIREMENT, ADMIRAL PILLING CONTINUED TO SERVE OUR NATION IN 
NUMEROUS CAPACITIES.  HE WAS THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
OF A NOT-FOR-PROFIT GOVERNMENT AND DEFENSE CONSULTING FIRM, LOGISTICS 
MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE, WHICH SPECIALIZES IN LOGISTICS AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
MANAGEMENT, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HUMAN RESOURCES, AND FINANCIAL 
RESOURCES PLANNING.  ADMIRAL PILLING WAS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE DEFENSE 
SCIENCE BOARD, THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS, THE WHITE HOUSE 
FELLOWS COMMISSION, AND SERVED ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES/ADVISORS AT THE 
NAVAL WAR COLLEGE, THE APPLIED PHYSICS LABORATORY OF THE JOHNS HOPKINS 
UNIVERSITY, AND THE NATIONAL DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL ASSOCIATION.  HE WAS A 
FELLOW OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION.
5.  ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE NAVY FAMILY, MANY OF WHOM HAD THE DISTINCT 
HONOR AND PRIVILEGE OF SERVING WITH ADMIRAL PILLING, I EXTEND OUR 
SINCERE CONDOLENCES AND HEARTFELT PRAYERS TO THE PILLING FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS DURING THIS TIME OF GRIEF AND REFLECTION.  WHILE DON PILLING 
WILL BE SORELY MISSED, HIS VISION AND LEGACY OF SERVICE WILL LIVE ON, 
AND OUR NAVY IS BETTER FOR IT.
6.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
