NARR/REF A IS DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INSTRUCTION 1341.13, POST 9-11 GI BILL.  
REF B IS OPNAVINST 1780.4, POST 9-11 GI BILL.  
REF C IS BUPERSNOTE 1780, POST 9-11 GI BILL.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces significant changes to Post 9-11 GI Bill 
transfer of education benefits (TEB) eligibility implemented in reference 
(a).  Policies herein supersede policies set forth in references (b) and (c).

2.  The Department of Defense (DoD) has updated reference (a) to reinforce 
TEB as a retention incentive that requires members to be eligible for and 
agree to serve 4 additional years of service on active duty or in the 
selected reserve beyond the date they elect to transfer their benefits.  
Members must complete the full 4-year service obligation to retain TEB unless 
involuntarily separated as indicated in enclosure (3) of reference (a), 
subparagraphs 3g(2)(a) through 3g(2)(h).  Failure to complete this obligation 
will result in the amount of any transferred entitlement that is used as of 
the date of such failure being treated as an overpayment of educational 
assistance and shall be subject to collection by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs.

3.  Changes listed in this NAVADMIN do not impact Sailors whose TEB 
applications submitted in the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) milConnect 
web portal at https://milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil, have been approved.

4.  TEB Eligibility
    a.  Effective immediately, all members requesting to transfer unused 
education benefits to eligible dependents must meet eligibility requirements 
to serve 4 additional years on active duty or in the selected reserve from 
the date of election in DMDC milConnect.
    b.  Former exceptions that permitted individuals with at least
10 years of service to obligate less than 4 years of service if precluded by 
statute or standard policy (DoD or Service) in return for TEB are cancelled.
    c.  Documentation of additional service obligation requirements found in 
references (b) and (c) remain unchanged.
    d.  Effective 12 July 2019, TEB will only be available for members with 
at least 6 years of service up to a maximum of 16 years of service who are 
eligible for and agree to 4 additional years of service beyond the date they 
elect to transfer their benefits.
THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE THAT IMPACTS SENIOR SAILORS WITH 16 OR MORE 
YEARS OF SERVICE.  ACTION IS REQUIRED PRIOR TO 12 JULY 2019 TO PRESERVE THE 
ABILITY TO TRANSFER BENEFITS OR THEY WILL BE LOST.

5.  Revised NAVPERS 1070/613, (page 13) language.  Effectively immediately, 
all required page 13 entries in the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System 
(NSIPS) must read as follows:  *I understand by signing this NAVPERS 
1070/613, I certify that I am retainable under all statutes and Navy policies 
for 4 years, and I agree to complete 4 more years in the Armed Forces (active 
or
SELRES) from the date I request transferability of Post 9/11 GI Bill 
education benefits to my dependents or family members using the Defense 
Manpower Data Center (DMDC) milConnect web site.  I understand that failure 
to complete this obligation may lead to an overpayment by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (DVA) for any benefit payments made to my dependents or 
family members that may be
recouped.*

6.  Part two of this change will announce updates to streamline the TEB 
submission procedures.

7.  Points of Contact
    a.  OPNAV N127 point of contact is Mr. James Johnson who can be reached 
at (703)604-5256/DSN 664 or via e-mail at james.p.johnson(at)navy.mil.
    b.  Active duty, Full-Time Support and Selected Reserve points of contact 
are contained in reference (c).

8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.

9.  Released by Vice Admiral R. P. Burke, N1.//
