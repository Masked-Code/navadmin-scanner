RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the updated nuclear Enlisted Supervisor 
Retention Pay (ESRP) policy memorandum, reference (a).
This ESRP policy memorandum and NAVADMIN supersede reference (b) and 
reference (c), respectively, effective 1 August 2022.  The ESRP Program 
provides a retention incentive to senior Navy nuclear- trained enlisted 
Sailors with highly specialized skills.  A detailed program description is 
outlined in reference (a) and can be found at
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Enlisted/Nuclear/Enlisted-Programs/.  The legal authority for ESRP 
is contained in section 331 of reference (d) and reference (e).  Current ESRP 
requirements limit the program as follows:
    a.  The minimum reenlistment length is 3 years.
    b.  The maximum bonus amount for each year of additional obligated 
service (AOS) is limited to 30,000 dollars as stated in section 331 of 
reference (d).  The implication of this limit is that to earn a 100,000-
dollar bonus the minimum AOS required is 40 months.
    c.  The maximum reenlistment lifetime bonus amount is 360,000 dollars.
    d.  All ESRP payments must be received prior to completion of 28 years of 
service (YOS).  The implication of this limit is that any ESRP installment 
that would be due after 28 YOS will be paid in the final installment prior to 
completion of 28 YOS.

2.  Notable changes in reference (a) are as follows:
    a.  Zone 2 eligibility is now defined as greater than or equal to 14 
years but less than completion of 17 years.
    b.  Zone 3 eligibility is now defined as greater than or equal to 17 
years but less than completion of 23 years.
    c.  Provides guidance for ESRP requests to be submitted through the Navy 
Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).
    d.  Updates compensation for any term of reenlistment is limited to 
30,000 per year of AOS (2,500/month of AOS).
    e.  Updates a service member cannot exceed combined SRB and ESRP payments 
totaling 360,000 dollars in a career.
    f.  Updates that anniversary payments may not be made after completion of 
28 YOS.
    g.  Provides clarity that each reenlistment must obligate service into 
the next zone.

3.  ESRP Award Multiples.  Award levels remain the same as previously 
released in reference (c) and are listed below:
    a.  ESRP Zone 1 and Zone 2 award level (AOS computation stops at 
completion of 16 YOS for Zone 1 and 18 YOS for Zone 2):
Rating    PNEC    Zone 1   Zone 2
ETNSS     N13S    9.5      4.5
EMNSS     N14S    8.0      4.5
MMNSS     N15S    7.5      4.5
ELTSS     N16S    7.5      4.5
ETNSW     N23S    7.5      4.5
EMNSW     N24S    8.0      4.5
MMNSW     N25S    7.5      4.5
ELTSW     N26S    6.0      4.5
    b.  ESRP Zone 3 award level (AOS computation stops at completion of 23 
YOS):
                 AOS      AOS       AOS
Rating    PNEC   1-24mos  25-36mos  37+mos

MMNSS     N15S   0.5      1.5       2.5
ELTSS     N16S   0.5      1.5       2.5
ETNSW     N23S   0.5      1.5       2.5
EMNSW     N24S   0.5      1.5       2.5
MMNSW     N25S   0.5      1.5       2.5
ELTSW     N26S   0.5      1.5       2.5

4.  Eligibility.  Only Sailors assigned with an active supervisor Navy 
enlisted classification (NEC) listed in paragraph 3 are eligible to reenlist 
for ESRP.  In addition, Service Members must hold a current security 
clearance or be in an open status for a new investigation.  ESRP requests and 
anniversary payments for personnel with special category NECs (N59X/N89X) 
will be held in abeyance pending final resolution.  Overall, ESRP eligibility 
requirements are defined in reference (a).  To encourage career progression 
and provide incentive for continued superior at-sea service, the following 
supplementary eligibility requirements remain in place for each ESRP zone:
    a.  ESRP Zone 1.  In addition to the requirements of reference (a), be 
assigned an active nuclear supervisor NEC (see paragraph 3).
    b.  ESRP Zone 2.  In addition to the requirements of reference (a), be a 
frocked E-7 or in the paygrade of E-7, E-8 or E-9 on the date of the ESRP 
Zone 2 reenlistment.
    c.  ESRP Zone 3.  In addition to the requirements of reference
(a):
        (1) Be a frocked E-8 or in the paygrade of E-8 or E-9 on the date of 
the ESRP Zone 3 reenlistment and
        (2) Have successfully previously served as, be currently serving as 
(on orders) or have been issued and accepted orders as a submarine 
engineering department master chief, nuclear aircraft carrier (CVN) major 
division leading chief petty officer, CVN reactor training division officer 
or CVN reactor department master chief.

5.  Application Process.  To ensure the approval message is released in a 
timely manner, ESRP reenlistment requests should be submitted
35 to 120 days in advance of the desired reenlistment date.
Exceptions to this policy can be approved by the ESRP program manager on an 
individual basis.
    a.  ESRP eligible service members must be recommended for reenlistment by 
their commanding officer.  The command may use the checklist (enclosure (l) 
of reference (a)) to assist in submitting the ESRP request within the NSIPS.
    b.  NSIPS is programmed to accept ESRP reenlistment requests and is the 
only method of submission.  If the command is unable to submit ESRP 
reenlistment requests due to operational commitments, then the commands 
immediate superior in command may submit the request via NSIPS.  Due to the 
transition from Officer Personnel Information System Force Management to 
NSIPS, the ESRP Program Manager can no longer submit a request for a Sailor 
or command.
Entering an ESRP request in NSIPS is similar to that of submitting a SRB 
request.  Other specifics for submitting ESRP requests in NSIPS are stated in 
reference (a).

6.  Officer Programs.  ESRP entitlement for Sailors who reenlist after 
applying for an officer program will be held pending selection results.  For 
limited duty officer, the application deadline is considered the suspense 
date as published in reference (f) and future announcement messages.  For all 
other commissioning programs, the date on which Nuclear Community Manager 
(OPNAV N133) approves the conditional release to apply for that program is 
the date after which additional ESRP entitlements will be held.

7.  Recoupment.  Repayment policy is governed by section 373 of reference 
(d), chapter 2 of reference (g) and reference (a), which collectively 
determines when repayment of the unearned portion of a bonus is required or 
not required, but left to Secretarial discretion or is prohibited.  Section 
373 of reference (d), requires repayment with certain exceptions.  As a 
general rule, repayment of any unearned portion of a bonus will be sought.  
Examples of situations requiring repayment are provided in reference (a).

8.  Service Record Entry.  An Administrative Remarks (NAVPERS
1070/613) entry acknowledging recoupment policy via NSIPS is required in the 
record of the Service Member prior to execution of an ESRP reenlistment 
(examples are provided in enclosure (2) of reference (a)).

9.  The point of contact is the ESRP Program Manager located at OPNAV N133 at 
(703) 604-5502/DSN 664 or via e-mail at nxag_n133d3(at)navy.mil or 
bullnuke(at)navy.mil.

10.  Released by Vice Admiral John B. Nowell, Jr, N1.
