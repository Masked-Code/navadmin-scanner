RMKS/1.  IN AUGUST 2010, BUREAU OF NAVAL PERSONNEL (BUPERS) UNCLASSIFIED 
MESSAGING SYSTEMS WILL BEGIN THE MIGRATION FROM DEFENSE MESSAGE SYSTEM (DMS) 
TO OFFICIAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE (OIX) AS REQUIRED BY REFS A AND B.  RELIABLE 
AND TIMELY EXCHANGE OF RECORD COMMUNICATIONS IN SUPPORT OF BUPERS MANPOWER AND 
PERSONNEL SUPPORT MISSIONS REMAINS THE PARAMOUNT GOAL.  THIS MESSAGE PROVIDES 
AN OVERVIEW OF TRANSITION MILESTONES, DESCRIBES PROCEDURES FOR OIX 
PARTICIPATION WITH BUPERS AND OUTLINES COMMAND ACTIONS TO ENSURE 
UNINTERRUPTED, RELIABLE COMMUNICATIONS WITH COMNAVPERSCOM AND OTHER BUPERS-
SUPPORTED ORGANIZATIONS.

2.  AFTER AUGUST 2010, THE PRIMARY FOR MESSAGE DELIVERY AND RECEIPT WILL BE 
OIX; HOWEVER, BUPERS WILL CONTINUE UNCLASSIFIED DMS SERVICES DURING THIS 
TRANSITION FOR AS LONG AS AVAILABLE.  REDELIVERY BY DMS WILL BE MANUAL ONLY 
AND IS DISCOURAGED EXCEPT IN UNUSUAL CASES.  EACH COMMAND MUST ENSURE BUPERS 
OIX SYSTEMS ARE PROVIDING RELIABLE AND TIMELY SERVICE PRIOR TO FINAL 
RETIREMENT OF UNCLASSIFIED DMS.

3.  BUPERS AUTOMATED INFORMATION SYSTEMS (AIS) GENERATED MESSAGES WILL USE OIX 
DELIVERY METHODS EXCLUSIVELY BEGINNING IN AUGUST 2010.  THIS INCLUDES OFFICER 
AND ENLISTED ORDERS AND ALL OTHER BUPERS-ORIGINATED MESSAGES.  BUPERS IS 
FIELDING THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE SYSTEM (GOES) TO ACT AS 
A N OIX ROUTING HUB FOR BUPERS OFFICIAL INFORMATION (OI) DATA.  GOES CAN 
RETAIN THE TRADITIONAL LEGACY MESSAGE FORMAT, SO OIX DELIVERY VIA E-MAIL WILL 
BE SUITABLE FOR INTERNAL ROUTING USING EXISTING USER PROFILES AND DISTRIBUTION 
RULES.  GOES WILL ALSO FEED OI DATA TO BUPERS ON-LINE (BOL), AS APPROPRIATE.

4.  DURING INITIAL BUPERS OIX TRANSITION, COMMANDS WILL EITHER RECEIVE DIRECT 
OI E-MAIL DELIVERY OR MUST ACCESS AND FORWARD OI DATA MANUALLY USING A WEB 
BROWSER.
COMMANDS WITH A PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED COMMAND E-MAIL ACCOUNT WILL BEGIN TO 
RECEIVE BUPERS OI AUTOMATICALLY IN COMMAND E-MAIL BOXES.  COMMANDS MUST 
COMPLETE ACTIONS OUTLINED IN REFS A AND B TO ACTIVATE COMMAND E-MAIL ACCOUNTS 
AND ENSURE UNINTERRUPTED DELIVERY.

5.  WEB ACCESS TO GOES ALLOWS COMMANDS TO CONFIGURE OR MODIFY THE COMMAND OIX 
DELIVERY ADDRESS, MAINTAIN AUTHORIZED USER LISTS, AND SEARCH, RETRIEVE AND 
REDELIVER PREVIOUS OI DATA FROM THE SYSTEM. COMMANDS WILL DESIGNATE A "GOES 
ADMIN" USER TO PERFORM THESE FUNCTIONS.  BECAUSE COMMAND "GOES ADMIN" DUTIES 
ARE INFREQUENT AND REQUIRE MINIMAL TRAINING, GOES ADMIN RESPONSIBILITIES MAY 
BE ASSIGNED AS APPROPRIATE WITHIN THE COMMAND.

6.  COMMANDS MAY ACTIVATE COMMAND ADMIN ACCOUNTS STARTING 1 AUGUST 2010 BY
ACCESSING:  HTTPS:(SLASH)(SLASH)WWW.GOES.PERSNET.NAVY.MIL.  ONCE 
AUTHENTICATED, THE GOES ADMIN USER WILL BE ABLE TO MODIFY THE LIST OF 
AUTHORIZED COMMAND USERS AND MODIFY OTHER CONFIGURABLE COMMAND PROPERTIES.  
NOTE:  THE COMMON ACCESS CARD
(CAC) IS THE ONLY AUTHORIZED MEANS OF IDENTIFYING AND AUTHENTICATING GOES 
ADMIN AND USER ACCOUNTS.

7.  USERS DESIGNATED AS COMMAND RELEASERS BY THE GOES ADMIN USER CAN TRANSMIT 
OI DIRECTLY TO GOES BY ADDRESSING E-MAIL TO:  
"GOES(AT)PROXY.PERSNET.NAVY.MIL."
ALL OIX E-MAIL MUST BE DIGITALLY SIGNED WITH CAC BY AN AUTHORIZED RELEASER OR 
IT WILL BE REJECTED.  THE E-MAIL BODY MAY CONTAIN EITHER A LEGACY (ACP-126) 
MESSAGE IMAGE OR AN ABBREVIATED SUBSET OF INFORMATION THAT PROVIDES THE 
REQUIRED ADDRESSING AND ROUTING INFORMATION.  EXAMPLES AND A LIST OF SUPPORTED 
E-MAIL OI PROPERTIES WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THE BUPERS GOES WEBSITE.

8.  UNCLASSIFIED MESSAGES SENT TO BUPERS WILL BE RELAYED AND ROUTED 
AUTOMATICALLY FOR AS LONG AS UNCLASSIFIED DMS REMAINS AVAILABLE.  WITH THE 
SCHEDULED ELIMINATION OF UNCLASSIFIED MESSAGING SYSTEMS IN SEPTEMBER 2010, 
COMMANDS MUST IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THE TRANSITION TO E-MAIL BASED SUBMISSION FOR 
BUPERS OIX.  AFTER TERMINATION OF UNCLASSIFIED DMS, ANY UNCLASSIFIED MESSAGES 
RECEIVED ON BUPERS SIPRNET SYSTEMS CANNOT BE ROUTED AUTOMATICALLY TO THE 
MAJORITY OF BUPERS USERS AND MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN BUPERS 
RECEIPT AND PROCESSING.
