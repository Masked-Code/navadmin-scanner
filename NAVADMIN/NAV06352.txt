NARR/REF A (DEFENSE LANGUAGE TRANSFORMATION ROADMAP TASK 1.0) DIRECTED 
CONVERSION OF DLPT FROM PAPER/PENCIL EXAMS TO WEB-BASED TESTING ACROSS 
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD).  REF B (NAVADMIN 300/05) ANNOUNCED THE 
INTRODUCTION OF THE WEB-BASED VERSION, DLPT5, WITHIN NAVY.  REF C 
ESTABLISHES DLPT5 AS THE OFFICIAL TEST FOR FLPB CERTIFICATION AND 
PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE TRANSITION PROCESS FROM EXISTING TEST FORMS TO 
DLPT5.  REF D AMPLIFIES REF C, PROVIDING ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO 
FACILITATE THE TRANSITION TO DLPT5.// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN 
ANNOUNCES THAT THE DLPT5 BECOMES THE OFFICIAL TEST FORM FOR FLPB 
CERTIFICATION IN THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGES PER REFS A THROUGH D EFFECTIVE 
1 JAN 07:
ALBANIAN         CHINESE MANDARIN                 DARI
GREEK            HINDI                            IRAQI
KOREAN           MODERN STANDARD ARABIC          NORWEGIAN
PASHTO           PERSIAN FARSI (UPPER RANGE)     RUSSIAN
SPANISH          URDU
2.  EARLIER VERSIONS OF THE DLPT IN THESE LANGUAGES ARE VALID THROUGH 
31 DEC 06; AFTER THIS DATE, EARLIER VERSIONS ARE NO LONGER AUTHORIZED. 
UNSCORED PRE-DLPT5 TESTS IN THESE LANGUAGES RECEIVED BY THE NAVY 
EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY CENTER 
(NETPDTC) AFTER 16 FEB 07 WILL NOT BE GRADED, NOR THE SCORES REGISTERED.
3.  AS DLPT5 TESTS ARE DEPLOYED IN ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES, THEY WILL BE 
USED AS THE OFFICIAL TESTS FOR FLPB CERTIFICATION.  PRE-DLPT5 TEST 
VERSIONS WILL BE AUTHORIZED UNTIL THE CORRESPONDING DLPT5 TEST IS 
DEPLOYED AND THEN WITHDRAWN FROM SERVICE THE DAY BEFORE THE DLPT5 
OFFICIAL RELEASE. THE ORAL PROFICIENCY INTERVIEW (OPI) WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE THE OFFICIAL TEST FOR THE SPEAKING MODALITY.
4.  AS A TEMPORARY MEASURE TO AID IN TRANSITIONING TO THE DLPT5, THE 
NAVY SENIOR LANGUAGE AUTHORITY (CNO N13) WILL:
    A. RECERTIFY MEMBERS FOR AN ADDITIONAL ONE-YEAR PERIOD USING
    SCORES FROM THEIR LAST RECORDED DLPT (OR OTHER TEST AUTHORIZED
    BY THE NAVY FOREIGN LANGUAGE OFFICE/N13F) IF THE MEMBER DOES NOT
    PERFORM AT THE SAME OR HIGHER LEVEL ON THE DLPT5.  AT THE END OF
    THE ONE-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD, THE MEMBER'S ANNUAL
    CERTIFICATION FOR FLPB SHALL BE BASED SOLELY ON DLPT5 SCORES.
    B.  RECERTIFY LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY USING THE LAST RECORDED DLPT
    SCORE FOR MEMBERS ASSIGNED TO LOCATIONS OUTSIDE CONUS (OCONUS)
    WHERE WEB-DELIVERED TESTING IS NOT AVAILABLE/ACCESSIBLE.
    RECERTIFICATION USING DLPT5 IS REQUIRED NO LATER THAN 180-DAYS
    FROM THE DATE THE MEMBER IS RELEASED FROM THEIR OCONUS
    ASSIGNMENT. IN ALL CASES, NON-AVAILABILITY OF DLPT5 WILL BE
    CERTIFIED BY NETPDTC.
5.  WAIVER REQUESTS DURING THIS ONE-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD ARE NOT 
REQUIRED.  IF THE TESTED INDIVIDUAL MEETS THE CONDITIONS OF PARA 3A OR 
3B ABOVE, CNO N13F WILL VERIFY EARLIER DLPT SCORES AS REPORTED BY 
NETPDTC AND CARRY FLPB OVER AT THE RATE EARNED BY THOSE SCORES.
6.  IN CASES WHERE DLPT SCORES ARE A DETERMINANT FOR RATING/DESIGNATOR 
QUALIFICATION, MEMBERS WILL BE CONSIDERED QUALIFIED AT THE LEVEL OF 
THEIR PRE-DLPT5 SCORE DURING THE ONE-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD.  IF THE 
PRE-DLPT5 SCORE DID NOT MEET ESTABLISHED CAREER/COMMUNITY STANDARDS, 
MEMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE CONSIDERED UNQUALIFIED.
7.  FOR CAREER LINGUISTS (CTI AND FOREIGN AREA OFFICERS), COMMANDING 
OFFICERS SHALL ENSURE REMARKS ARE INCLUDED IN EVALUATIONS AND FITNESS 
REPORTS (AS APPROPRIATE) INDICATING THE MEMBER REMAINS LINGUISTICALLY 
QUALIFIED IF THEIR INITIAL DLPT5 RESULTS ARE LOWER THAN OTHERWISE 
QUALIFYING PRE-DLPT5 SCORES.
