SUBJ/OBSERVANCE OF WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH 2010//                      
RMKS/1.  DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH WE CELEBRATE THE ANNUAL OBSERVANCE
OF WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH.  WE TAKE THIS TIME TO REFLECT ON THE       
REMARKABLE CONTRIBUTIONS WOMEN HAVE MADE THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF   
OUR NAVY AND NATION.  THE 2010 NATIONAL THEME, "WRITING WOMEN BACK   
INTO HISTORY," PAYS TRIBUTE TO WOMEN SERVING IN THE NAVY TOTAL FORCE,
BOTH MILITARY AND CIVILIAN.                                          
2.  SINCE BECOMING A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE NAVY IN 1908, WOMEN HAVE
HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR NAVY AND NATION.  IN WORLD WAR II    
MORE THAN 97,000 WOMEN DONNED THE UNIFORM AND GAVE UNPRECEDENTED     
SERVICE IN MYRIAD JOBS PREVIOUSLY HELD ONLY BY MEN.  IN 1967, PRESIDENT 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON SIGNED LEGISLATION REMOVING RANK RESTRICTIONS ON 
WOMEN IN THE MILITARY.  THE VAST MAJORITY OF CHANGE BEGAN IN 1978 WHEN 
UNITED STATES CODE, TITLE 10 WAS AMENDED TO PERMIT ASSIGNMENT OF WOMEN 
TO SEA DUTY BILLETS ON NON-COMBATANT SHIPS.  
IN 1994, THE COMBAT EXCLUSION LAW WAS REPEALED AND WOMEN WERE ASSIGNED 
TO SEA DUTY BILLETS ABOARD SURFACE COMBATANTS AND AVIATION SQUADRONS, 
PROVIDING AT SEA OPPORTUNITIES TO MANY OF THE FEMALE FLAG OFFICERS AND
MASTER CHIEFS IN THE NAVY TODAY.            
3.  WOMEN ARE CONTRIBUTING IN TODAY'S NAVY MORE THAN EVER BEFORE AND 
THEIR ROLES CONTINUE TO INCREASE.  ONE OF THE CRITICAL FORCE         
PROVIDERS FOR THE HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS IN HAITI IS NAVY EXPEDITIONARY
COMBAT COMMAND (NECC), COMMANDED BY RADM CAROL POTTENGER.  IN THE    
FIGHT AGAINST TERROR, NAVY CIVILIAN AHN DUONG'S WORK ON THE          
THERMOBARIC WEAPON HAS SIGNIFICANTLY SUPPORTED MULTI-NATIONAL FORCES 
WITH A TOOL USED TO EFFECTIVELY COMBAT TERRORIST CELLS USING TUNNELS 
AND CAVES.  IN JANUARY 2010, FOR THE FIRST TIME, A WOMAN WAS ASSIGNED 
TO COMMAND A CARRIER STRIKE GROUP (CSG) WHEN RDML NORA TYSON WAS SLATED 
TO COMMAND CARRIER STRIKE GROUP TWO.  THESE ARE JUST THREE EXAMPLES 
AMONG THE THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO ARE IN OUR GLOBAL FORCE 
FOR GOOD.                                       
4.  DUE TO THE EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE OF THE 120,000 ACTIVE, RESERVE, 
AND CIVILIAN WOMEN SERVING TODAY, AND THE EXPANDING PROGRAMS AND     
POLICIES, THE NAVY WAS SELECTED AS A FINALIST FOR THE 2009 CATALYST  
AWARD - AN AWARD GIVEN TO ORGANIZATIONS WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY          
DEMONSTRATE THEIR SUPPORT IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF WOMEN.  OUR NAVY IS THE 
FIRST GOVERNMENT ENTITY TO DATE TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS AWARD 
IN ITS 22 YEAR HISTORY.                                              
5.  WE SALUTE ALL WOMEN IN THE NAVY, MILITARY AND CIVILIAN, AND 
ENCOURAGE ALL COMMANDS TO RECOGNIZE WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH BY
