REGULATION// 

RMKS/1. 3 March 2015, will mark the Centennial anniversary of the 
establishment of the Navy Reserve. Since the birth of our country Citizen-
Sailors served as Navy Militia units until Congressional action officially 
established a federal Navy Reserve in 1915. They have supported our country 
in every major conflict. This message provides initial guidance and tasks for 
the global execution and planning of this important commemoration. 

2. In support of reference (a), execute a commemorative event commensurate 
with the importance of the Navy Reserve Centennial Commemoration (NRCC) for 
our Navy and nation.  

3. Commander's intent: The year-long commemoration will begin with a kick-off 
ceremony at the U.S. Navy Memorial on 3 March 2015 and continue through 
December 2015. The goal of this commemoration is to demonstrate pride in the 
history and heritage of the Navy Reserve and educate the American public, 
particularly in non-fleet concentration areas, on the value and capabilities 
of the Navy Reserve. Commemoration activities should welcome neighboring 
communities, surrounding veteran organizations, civilian employers of 
Sailors, and prominent civilians when and where able. Although expenditures 
should reflect today's fiscal environment, the conduct and result of 
commemorations should instill a richer understanding and a greater 
appreciation of the U.S. Navy Reserve. All actions shall be consistent with 
applicable law and policy, to include reference (b).
