RMKS/1.  This message shall be read in its entirety to ensure all 
stakeholders in the ship inactivation process are aware of the projected 
retirement schedule for the upcoming fiscal year 2017, respective 
responsibilities and necessary follow-up actions.  Ship retirement decisions 
reflected in paragraph 2 below align with the President's Budget for 2017 or 
subsequent execution year decisions made by leadership.

2.  To facilitate fleet planning efforts to conduct decommissioning 
continuous maintenance availability (CMAV) or inactivation availability 
(INAC), the projected schedule for inactivating U.S. battle force and non-
battle force naval vessels in FY17 is promulgated as follows:

Ship Name		Proj Inactive Date 	Post Inactive Status
USNS SAFEGUARD              01 Oct 2016		Out of Service, In Reserve
(T-ARS 50)
USNS GRAPPLE                01 Oct 2016		Out of Service, In Reserve
(T-ARS 53)
USNS NAVAJO                 01 Oct 2016		Logistics Support Asset

(SSN 700)
USS BUFFALO                 30 Sep 2017		Dismantlement
(SSN 715)

3. For the purposes of this NAVADMIN, inactivation dates projected in para 2 
refer to the start of an INAC for nuclear vessels, when the vessels are no 
longer counted as part of the Navy's battle force. Decommissioning will occur 
at a later date and be reported to CNO per ref (a).

4. Per ref (b), Fleet Commanders shall submit an Organizational Change 
Request for commissioned USS ships and per ref (a), MSC shall submit a naval 
message for USNS ships, to formally notify the Office of the Chief of Naval 
Operations (OPNAV) of a ships decommissioning, INAC, or end of service. 
Submit revisions due to operational schedule changes IAW refs (a) and (b).  
It is the responsibility of Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command and 
Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet in coordination with their respective TYCOM to 
ensure the appropriate lower echelon commands are notified of any changes in 
the ship inactivation schedules, as well as Warfare Integration (N9I) and 
OPNAV resource sponsor.

5.  Adjustments to para 2 ship inactivations that cross the current fiscal 
year must be coordinated with OPNAV N9I due to reporting requirements that 
Navy must inform Congress on execution year force structure changes that 
differ from what Congress authorized/appropriated and signed into law by the 
President.  OPNAV shall promulgate changes to the inactivation fiscal year as 
required.

6.  The ships commanding officer, masters, or Immediate Superior In Command, 
shall submit a final naval message (normally transmitted in conjunction with 
the decommissioning ceremony) announcing the ships official retirement date 
and include a brief history of the significant events in the life of the ship 
per ref (a).  The Naval History and Heritage Command (NAVHISTHERITAGE 
WASHINGTON DC) and Naval Vessel Register Custodian (NVR NORFOLK VA), shall be 
included as INFO addees.

7.  Released by RADM M. C. Manazir, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, Warfare 
Systems (N9).//
