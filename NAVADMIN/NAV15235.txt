SUBJ/CNO BIRTHDAY MESSAGE TO THE FLEET//

RMKS/1.  Happy Birthday Team!

2.  As I mentioned in my first message to the fleet, our ships, submarines 
and aircraft form the muscle and bones of the Navy, but the heart and soul of 
our Navy is you, our people.

3.  On 13 October, we honor and celebrate two hundred and forty years of 
proud, committed Americans raising their right hand to become Sailors and 
defend our country.  Every day around the world, our people can be found on, 
under, and over the sea.  You are smart, resourceful and committed Americans 
who want to be part of something special - to be part of our high-performing 
Navy Team.  You are a formidable force.

4.  Our Navy team is fueled by integrity, creativity, and toughness. Together 
we are greater than the sum of our individual parts. Together, we are ready 
to fight and win at sea.

5.  It is because of this teamwork, fused together by common bonds of Honor, 
Courage, and Commitment, that we will continue to be the greatest Navy in the 
world.

6.  To all our Sailors, Navy civilians, proud families, and Veterans around 
the globe, Happy Birthday and thank you for your service.

7.  Released by ADM J. M. Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations.//
