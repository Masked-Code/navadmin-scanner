2.  Occasion for Wear

Authorized wear during shipboard evolutions, damage control efforts and 
General Quarters will be in line with the unit commanding officer discretion.
    b.  Optional Uniform Outer Garment.  The SWO leather jacket is authorized 
for optional wear ashore with Service (Service Khaki and Summer White) and 
Service Dress Blue (SDB) uniforms only.  When worn with SDBs, it may be worn 
in lieu of the SDB coat when commuting, in public places, attending working 
level meetings or briefings and within office environments.  The SWO leather 
jacket will not be worn with SDBs while attending ceremonies, official

3.  Manner of Wear

three-fourths of the way up, collar down and sleeves fully extended between

identity of the wearer.  The unit commanding officer will determine manner of 
wear during General Quarters and all shipboard evolutions.
    b.  Nametags will be attached to the jacket via hook and loop tape on the 
left side of the wearer.  Unit commanders may authorize the wear of the 
standard leather nametag in line with reference (c) or a unit specific 
embroidered fabric nametag.  Fabric nametags will be 2 inches by 4 inches in
