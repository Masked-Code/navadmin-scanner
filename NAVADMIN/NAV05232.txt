SUBJ/EXPANDED FAMILY SERVICEMEMBERS GROUP LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  NAVADMIN 281/01 ANNOUNCED EXPANDED FAMILY
SERVICEMEMBERS' GROUP LIFE INSURANCE (FSGLI) PROGRAM TO INCLUDE
SPOUSE AND CHILDREN COVERAGE.  EFFECTIVE 1 NOVEMBER 2001 SPOUSES AND
CHILDREN WERE AUTOMATICALLY COVERED UNDER FSGLI, INCLUDING
MILITARY-TO-MILITARY COUPLES, REGARDLESS OF SERVICE AFFILIATION.
PREMIUMS WERE DEDUCTED BASED ON DATA OBTAINED FROM THE DEFENSE
ENROLLMENT ELIGIBILITY REPORTING SYSTEM/REAL-TIME AUTOMATED
PERSONNEL IDENTIFICATION SYSTE (DEERS/RAPIDS).  THE SPOUSE'S AGE
DETERMINES THE PREMIUM COSTS. CHILDREN ARE COVERED FREE BASED ON
SGLI PARTICIPATION.  AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES, TWO AREAS OF
CONCERN HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED:
    A.  FAILURE TO DECLINE COVERAGE.  PUBLIC LAW 107-14 MANDATED
SPOUSE COVERAGE AND EACH SAILOR IS RESPONSIBLE TO REVIEW THEIR
COVERAGE, DECIDE WHETHER TO CONTINUE SPOUSE COVERAGE OR
DECLINE/TERMINATE SPOUSE COVERAGE BY SUBMITTING A FAMILY COVERAGE
ELECTION FORM (SGLV 8286A).  FAILURE TO SUBMIT AN SGLV 8286A
CONTINUES SPOUSE COVERAGE AND A DEBT FOR PAST DUE PREMIUMS MAY OCCUR.
    B.  REGISTRATION OF SPOUSES.  TO ENSURE PREMIUM PAYMENTS ARE
DEDUCTED FOR MILITARY-TO-MILITARY COUPLES, BOTH MILITARY MEMBERS
NEED TO BE REGISTERED IN DEERS/RAPIDS AS A SPOUSE WITH "NO
BENEFITS."  NOT ENROLLING THE MILITARY SPOUSE WILL RESULT IN FSGLI
COVERAGE WITHOUT DEDUCTED PREMIUMS.  THIS WILL RESULT IN AN
INDEBTEDNESS TO THE GOVERNMENT WHICH WILL BE DISCOVERED DURING A PAY
AUDIT.  ONCE THIS DEBT IS DISCOVERED, SAILORS WILL BE CHARGED PAST
PREMIUMS FOR FSGLI RETROACTIVE FROM THE DATE OF MARRIAGE OR
1 NOVEMBER 2001, WHICHEVER IS MORE RECENT.
2.  SAILORS IN A MILITARY-TO-MILITARY MARRIAGE MUST REPORT THEIR
SPOUSE AS A SPOUSE WITH "NO BENEFITS" TO DEERS/RAPIDS EFFECTIVE
IMMEDIATELY.  FAILURE TO REGISTER MILITARY-TO-MILITARY SPOUSES IN
DEERS/RAPIDS AND EXECUTE AN SGLV 8286A TO TERMINATE COVERAGE, IF
DESIRED, WILL RESULT IN FURTHER INDEBTEDNESS.
3.  AFTER PROPER REGISTRATION IN DEERS/RAPIDS THE DEFENSE FINANCE
AND ACCOUNTING SERVICE WILL AUTOMATICALLY DEDUCT PREMIUMS
RETROACTIVE FROM THE DATE OF MARRIAGE OR 1 NOVEMBER 2001, WHICHEVER
IS MORE RECENT.  TO DECLINE OR DECREASE SPOUSE COVERAGE, SAILORS
MUST SUBMIT AN SGLV 8286A FORM IMMEDIATELY.  THE PERSONNEL SUPPORT
DETACHMENT/PERSONNEL OFFICE MUST WAIT 60 DAYS AFTER THE DEERS/RAPIDS
ENROLLMENT BEFORE A TERMINATION REQUEST CAN BE PROCESSED.  REFUNDS
WILL BE BASED ON THE DATE OF THE SGLV 8286A.
