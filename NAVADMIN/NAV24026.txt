RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Advancement Examination Readiness Review 
(AERR) schedule from April 2024 through September 2024.  AERR panels provide 
an opportunity for selected rating Fleet Subject Matter Experts (FSME) from 
Fleet and shore based commands to positively impact their respective ratings 
by updating and validating the examination question banks.  Selected Chief, 
Senior Chief, and Master Chief Petty Officers on Active Duty, Training and 
Administration of the Reserves, and Reservists currently on Active Duty for 
Operational Support may take part in the process.  AERRs enable the Navy to 
advance the most qualified and rating-knowledgeable Sailors. 
 
2.  AERRs are held at the Naval Education and Training Professional 
Development Center (NETPDC) in Pensacola, Florida.  Temporary Duty Travel 
(TDY) in support of AERR events is considered mission critical and is Flag 
Officer approved.  TDY costs shall be funded by NETPDC in line with 
applicable Joint Travel Regulations. 
 
3.  In line with reference (a), Type Commanders (TYCOM) and rating sponsors 
will recruit rating FSMEs, select AERR panel members plus two alternate 
members, and provide names and contact information no less than 45 days prior 
to the AERR convening date to NETPDC via e-mail at 
NETPDC_AERR_MAILBOX@us.navy.mil with a subject line of "AERR Selectees."
