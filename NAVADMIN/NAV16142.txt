RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits leadership assistance in capturing data for 
the Quartermaster (QM) and Sonar Technician (STG) rating per reference (a) 
and as published in reference (b), in support of Navy Manpower Analysis 
Center (NAVMAC) implementation of occupational standards (OCCSTDs) reviews.

2.  NAVMAC data collection strategy will incorporate remote collection of QM 
and STG rating information via a web-based survey.  Beginning July 2016, 
NAVMAC will e-mail Sailors their unique log-in and password information to 
access the web-based survey.  The survey will run through 31 October 2016 for 
Sailor (E-4 to E-7) participation to provide responses for rating-related 
tasks being performed to validate the work within a rating.

3.  Input from your Sailors in these ratings is essential to ensure an 
accurate, comprehensive representation of tasks currently being performed 
within the rating.  Maximum participation ensures validation of the 
foundational work our Sailors perform.

4.  Accurate Fleet input to the OCCSTD review process is vital to the ready 
relevant learning (RRL) initiative.  As the executive agent for RRL, U.S. 
Fleet Forces Command (USFF) fully supports NAVMACs survey data collection 
initiative.  USFF strongly encourages unit khaki leadership to ensure that 
Sailors are:
    a.  Provided time to complete the surveys; and
    b.  Understand the importance of providing accurate input to NAVMAC.

5.  The engagement of leadership in capturing this data is pivotal to the 
success of this data collection effort.  The point of contact is Ms. Michele 
Jackson, at (901) 874-6276/DSN 882, or via e-mail at
michele.a.jackson(at)navy.mil.
