RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance in support of reference (a) as it 
relates to senior chief petty officer (SCPO) evaluations regulated by 
reference (b).  Reporting seniors should take the following actions when 
evaluating SCPOs who screened for master chief petty officer (MCPO) via the 
Senior Enlisted Marketplace E-9 screening board: 
    a.  Maintain screened SCPOs in their regular reporting periodicity. 
(e.g. annual reports ending on 15 September) 
    b.  Maintain screened SCPOs in their regular E-8 grouping per the 
following: 
        (1) Block 8:  "Regular" report usage required. 
        (2) Block 21:  "N/A" unless another option applies (such as 
Individual Augmentee). 
        (3) Block 41:  When appropriate reporting seniors are encouraged to 
document that a SCPO has not moved up in rankings/performance mark average 
due to screened SCPOs in front of them. 
 
2.  Additionally, in cases where a screened SCPO's performance would 
negatively impact their screened status, reporting seniors are encouraged to 
document deficiencies in performance or behavior in a special report. 
 
3.  For questions and concerns regarding this policy, contact FORCM(AW/SW) 
William P. Houlihan at (901) 874-3030, or via e-mail at
