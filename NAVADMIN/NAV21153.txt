RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the Fiscal Year
(FY) 2022 Full-Time Support (FTS) Captain Selective Retention
(SELRET) Board.

2.  The SELRET Board is required to retain FTS captains beyond 3 years time 
in grade bringing FTS inventory in line with authorized end strength, 
allowing for stable promotion opportunity.

3.  The FY22 FTS Captain SELRET Board will convene on 20 September
2021 to consider FTS captains in all competitive categories for retention.  
FTS captains who were promoted during FY-20 will be looked at for their first 
gate and FTS captains who were promoted during FY-17 will be looked at for 
their second gate.  In line with reference (a), second gate FTS captains not 
selected for retention will retire or be released from Active Duty no later 
than 1 September 2022 and first gate FTS captains not selected for retention 
will retire or be released from Active Duty no later than
1 September 2023.  In either case, FTS officers will be retained on Active 
Duty, if necessary, to enable the officer to become eligible for a regular 
Active Duty retirement.
