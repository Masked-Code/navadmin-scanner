RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Training and 
Administration of the Reserve (TAR) Aviation Command Retention Bonus (ACRB), 
authorized in line with references (a) and (b). 
 
2.  The TAR ACRB is designed to retain those officers with the capabilities 
and command experience in our primary warfighting missions that are critical 
for the future of our service.  Our cadre of Commander (CDR) Commanding 
Officers (CO) lead our Naval Aviation Enterprise today and they are the major 
commanders and flag officers of tomorrow.  Their skills and leadership 
experience are essential to the success of the Navy.  The FY24 TAR ACRB 
incentivizes their continued service in follow-on assignments requiring 
senior aviation leaders. 
    a.  FY24 TAR ACRB applicants must have screened on the FY22 through FY24 
Aviation Command Screen Board (ACSB) as CO of an eligible operational, 
operational training, or special mission CDR command in order to 
apply.  Eligible commands are those for which the annual ACSB selects 
officers to serve as CO, excluding second-in-grade/sequential/bonus/fleet 
replacement squadron commands.  Consult the FY24 TAR ACRB program information 
for specific eligibility criteria and limitations.  The application 
opportunity commences with the release of this NAVADMIN and closes on 15 
March 2024. 
    b.  All FY24 ACRB contracts will be worth $100,000.  Eligible officers 
will receive an initial payment of $34,000 and two anniversary payments of 
$33,000.  Participation in the FY24 TAR ACRB obligates recipients to 3 years 
of obligated service to include full completion of a Post Command Commander 
(PCC) tour, which may be between 24 and 36 months depending on 
assignment.  ACRB obligation ends at the completion of 22 years of service, 
the projected rotation date of the assigned PCC tour, or 3 years from 
contract acceptance date, whichever is later.  ACRB applications for those 
currently under Aviation Department Head Retention Bonus (ADHRB) obligations 
will be accepted, held in abeyance and activated upon ADHRB contract 
expiration. 
 
3.  Additional ACRB Information 
    a.  Officers accepting ACRB contracts are not precluded from 
participating  in the Career Intermission Program (CIP).  Officers 
interested in both ACRB and CIP should contact the ACRB program manager and 
their detailer for more information. 
    b.  For further ACRB details, eligibility and application procedures,
