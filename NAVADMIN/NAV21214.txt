RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces changes in Tuition Assistance (TA) and Navy 
College Program for Afloat College Education (NCPACE) policy in references 
(a) through (c). 
 
2.  In line with reference (d), the annual cap on TA and NCPACE is increased 
to 18 semester hours (or equivalent quarter hours) per fiscal year, effective 
1 October 2021. 
 
3.  We are committed to ensuring fully-qualified Sailors can take advantage 
of this increased education opportunity in a manner that reinforces our 
commitment to professionalism, warfighting, readiness and 
retention.  Operational readiness remains our top priority.  As always, 
commanding officers may establish benchmark qualifications for Sailors and 
officers under their command, and manage off-duty education pursuit, based on 
current or anticipated operational commitments. 
 
4.  The following management controls are effective for TA and NCPACE courses 
command approved after the release of this NAVADMIN: 
    a.  In addition to being recommended for retention and promotion, all 
enlisted Sailors and officers must receive individual trait marks of 3.0 or 
greater on their most recent observed performance evaluation or fitness 
report. 
    b.  The wait time following non-judicial punishment (NJP) or court 
martial is increased from 6 to 12 months. 
    c.  Officers, with the exception of limited duty officers (LDO) and chief 
warrant officers (CWO), become eligible upon promotion to O-3. 
    d.  The minimum time in service requirement increases from two to three 
years.  There is no *grandfather* clause.  Sailors who began using TA or 
NCPACE at two years, but have not yet reached three years, must wait until 
the three year mark to continue. 
    e.  Enlisted Sailors with less than 16 years of service must have at 
least 12 months remaining from the course start date until their end of 
active obligated service (EAOS) or as extended. Reservists on active duty 
(AD) orders must have 12 months remaining from the course start date until 
the end date of AD orders. Contract extensions for AD Sailors are authorized 
subject to eligibility criteria in reference (e).  Sailors selected for LDO 
or CWO, and selective reenlistment bonus eligible Sailors with approved 
Career Waypoints in-rate quotas may request a waiver of the 12-month 
requirement using issue tracker as described in paragraph 7. 
    f.  Sailors may only take two funded courses per fiscal quarter 
determined by start date. 
    g.  Vouchers for command-approved requests will be funded no more than 30 
days prior to the course start date. 
    h. Command approving officials must verify all existing and updated 
policies have been met prior to authorizing TA or NCPACE. 
 
5.  Academic degrees are only one tool to enhance Sailors personal and 
professional development.  Civilian certifications offered through Navy 
Credentialing Opportunities Online (COOL) and United Services Military 
Apprenticeship Program should be stacked with academic degrees to create a 
well-rounded portfolio.  Sailors can find relevant credentials on their 
Learning and Development Roadmap (LaDR), and the Navy COOL website.  The 
MilGears, powered by the Navy COOL website, allows Sailors to search the LaDR 
recommended credentials in the *Quick Explorer* tool or receive customized 
career path recommendations based on their unique training, education and 
experience by using the *Engage My Career* tool.  For more information 
regarding MilGears, Sailors can visit the following site by going to MyNavy 
Portal at https://my.navy.mil/quick-links.html, select *Navy Cool* and then 
*MilGears*. 
 
6.  Sailors who wish to pursue other education funding options, to include GI 
Bill benefits, are encouraged to contact the Navy College Virtual Education 
Center (NCVEC) to speak with a counselor. 
 
7.  For questions regarding eligibility, degree plans or other education 
funding options, contact the NCVEC at 1-877-838-1659. Beginning 1 October 
2021, NCVEC telephone assistance will be available exclusively through MyNavy 
Career Center by calling 1-833-330-MNCC (6622).  Using the phone menu 
options, choose *Education and Training*, then *NCVEC*.  Additionally, 
Sailors may submit an inquiry via the issue tracker feature in MyNavy 
Education, located on the top right of their record. 
8.  For questions concerning TA or NCPACE policy, contact Mr. Jim 
Johnson at (703)604-5256/DSN 664 or james.p.johnson.civ(at)us.navy.mil. 
 
9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
