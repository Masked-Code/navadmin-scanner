RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the renewal and modification of the Surface 
Warfare Officer (SWO) Department Head Retention Bonus (DHRB) for eligible 
SWOs.

2.  Program Authority.  This program is authorized under section 332, Title 
37 U.S. Code.  In line with reference (a), the SWO DHRB is effective through 
30 September 2027 unless rescinded or superseded.  All applications for the 
bonuses contained within this program will be submitted to the SWO 
Assignments Division (PERS-41) for approval, payment processing, and 
tracking.

3.  Program Overview.  This message summarizes the provisions of the SWO 
DHRB.  All information provided herein is applicable to both Active Component 
(AC) SWO personnel and Reserve Component Training and Administration of the 
Reserve (TAR) SWO personnel, except where otherwise noted.  The following 
general summary is provided:
    a.  Year Group (YG)-16 and junior are eligible for the DHRB program.
    b.  Early selection at the SWO Department Head (DH) screening board will 
be rewarded with potentially larger compensation.
    c.  SWO lieutenant junior grades will have the opportunity to commit to 
DHRB as early as their 3rd Year of Commissioned Service
(YCS-3) anniversary date if screened on their first look for DH.
The service obligation incurred by DHRB will begin no earlier than the 
officer's minimum service requirement.
   d.  Officers currently under SWO DHRB contract are not eligible for the 
new payment scheme and renegotiation of current SWO DHRB contracts is not 
permitted.
   e.  References (b) and (c) limit career retention bonus amounts.
While officers may receive multiple retention bonuses under section
332 of reference (b) over a career, total bonus payments under this authority 
may not exceed $300K for AC officers and $150K for TAR officers.

4.  Program Eligibility.
    a.  Must meet all four of the following requirements:
        (1) Qualified and serving as an Active Duty SWO (designator 
1110/1117).
        (2) Completed at least one division officer tour, or be assigned to a 
fleet-up or single longer tour billet as approved by PERS-41.
        (3) Administratively screened for DH afloat by the surface DH 
screening board.
        (4) Agree to complete two afloat DH tours or a single longer DH tour 
as assigned by PERS-41, or complete commissioned service through YCS-10, 
whichever is later.
    b.  Eligible officers must be sea duty assignable as defined by reference 
(d).  Additionally:
        (1) An officer under contract evaluated as no longer fit for sea duty 
by an appropriate medical authority and placed on temporary limited duty will 
have a stop payment placed on their account and receive no further SWO DHRB 
payments.
        (2) Should a previously ineligible officer later become fit for sea 
duty, PERS-41, in line with the appropriate medical authority's findings, 
will resume payments at the date the officer is fit for sea duty for the 
remainder of the contract relative to the current YCS.
    c.  Operational Deferment.  An officer in an operational deferment status 
will remain eligible to receive DHRB payments.
    d.  Career Intermission Program (CIP).  An officer participating in CIP 
will be ineligible to receive DHRB payments during the intermission period.  
Scheduled payments will resume upon return to service and in line with the 
payment scheme.

5.  Program Execution.
    a.  The annual SWO DH screening board will determine eligibility by the 
selection of proven performers and conduct a performance validation of 
officers already receiving DHRB payments.
    b.  The SWO community manager is assigned as the program manager and is 
delegated the authority to administer the SWO DHRB program according to 
applicable Laws, Department of Defense directives/instructions, and this 
NAVADMIN.
    c.  PERS-41 receives applications submitted in the format referenced in 
paragraph 7.  PERS-41 is delegated the authority to:
        (1) Evaluate eligibility of officers applying for the SWO DHRB 
program.
        (2) Approve SWO contracts to remain on Active Duty for the stated 
period in exchange for a SWO DHRB.
        (3) Administer DHRB payments.
    d.  All applications require written endorsement from the applicant's 
commander or Commanding Officer (CO).
    e.  Officers selected for DH must submit a contract prior to the 
designated time in paragraph 6.a. to receive maximum compensation.
    f.  Submissions after YCS-9 will not be accepted or approved unless the 
delays were caused by factors outside the officer's control.  In those cases, 
the application submission must include a CO's endorsement explaining the 
cause of the delay and why the situation was beyond the officer's control.  
In all cases, final determination will be on a case-by-case basis and 
approved by PERS-41.
    g.  Officers approved for a DHRB will receive anniversary payments on 
their YCS anniversary date in accordance with the payment structure.
    h.  Officers under a DHRB agreement are not eligible to apply for the 
Permanent Military Instructor (PMI) program, or any redesignation programs 
that result in a designator change to any designator other than 1110/1117.  
An officer under a DHRB agreement may submit an application for PMI or any 
redesignation program once the date of application is within 12 months of the 
final day of bonus obligation.

7.  Application Process.
    a.  General Notes
        (1) Application format can be found on the PERS-41 page of the 
MyNavyHR Naval Personnel Command website at
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Detailing/Officer/Pers-41-
SWO/Pay-Incentives/SWO-DH-Retention/
        (2) Applications will be binding upon the date of approval by PERS-
41.
        (3) Applications received in the incorrect format or not meeting 
eligibility requirements defined in this NAVADMIN will be rejected.
    b.  Officers must submit a copy of the signed original contract and CO's 
endorsement by e-mail to their applicable assignment officer and/or civilian 
assistant.

8.  Recoupment and Repayment Policy.  Repayment policy is governed by section 
373 of reference (b) and reference (e).  A Service Member of the uniformed 
Services who enters into a written agreement with specified service 
conditions for receipt of a bonus is entitled to the full amount of the bonus 
if the member fulfills the conditions of the written agreement.  If the 
member fails to fulfill the service conditions specified in the written 
agreement for the pay, then the pay may be terminated and the Service Member 
may be required to repay an amount equal to the unearned portion of the pay.  
SWO DHRB payments will be stopped for officers who become ineligible for this 
incentive or fail to complete the full period of additional obligated 
service.
    a.  Officers who fail to complete DH school and/or fail to report to 
their first DH tour are subject to recoupment of all unearned payments 
received to date in accordance with reference (e).
    b.  Officers processed for Detachment For Cause (DFC) during either DH 
tour will have a stop payment placed on their account.  If the DFC is 
approved, recoupment will be calculated to begin on the date of DFC 
acknowledgment included in the DFC package.  If the DFC is overturned, the 
stop payment will be cleared after final adjudication is received by PERS-41 
and the officer will continue to receive future scheduled payments.  
Retroactive pay for any missed payments will be considered on a case-by-case 
basis in accordance with references (c) and (e).
    c.  For officers who die while serving under a SWO DHRB service 
agreement, the remaining SWO DHRB balance will be paid as a lump sum as part 
of the settlement of the final military pay account of the officer.  If death 
is determined to be the result of the misconduct of the member, future 
payments will be stopped and unearned portions of the bonus will be recouped, 
as applicable, in line with procedures established for members whose 
inability to complete a contracted period of service is voluntary or the 
result of misconduct.
    d.  Recoupment exception to policy determinations will be made by 
Director, Military Personnel Plans and Policy Division (OPNAV N13).

9.  Additional guidance, information and updates regarding the SWO DHRB are
