EMAIL/JOSE.TORES5ATNAVY.MIL// 
RMKS/1. IN HIS GUIDANCE FOR 2007-2008, CNO DIRECTED THE DEVELOPMENT AND 
PROMULGATION OF A NAVY ETHOS STATEMENT AS AN UNDERPINNING TO MISSION 
SUCCESS NAVY-WIDE. FORMALLY DEFINED, ETHOS GENERALLY IDENTIFIES THE 
DISTINGUISHING CHARACTER, CULTURE, OR GUIDING BELIEFS OF A PERSON, 
GROUP, OR INSTITUTION. THE PURPOSE OF THE NAVY ETHOS STATEMENT IS TO 
COMMUNICATE AND EMPHASIZE THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND VALUES WE 
WOULD EXPECT TO BE SHARED BY ALL WHO SERVE WITHIN THE NAVY 
TEAM,MILITARY AND CIVILIAN ALIKE, NO MATTER WHAT COMMUNITY, COMMAND, 
SPECIALTY, OR POSITION EACH OF US ARE ASSOCIATED WITH.
2. TO ENABLE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ETHOS STATEMENT THAT REPRESENTS A SHARED 
VIEW OF OUR NAVY CULTURE, INPUT FROM NAVY ACTIVE, RESERVE AND CIVILIAN 
PERSONNEL IS DESIRED. A SMALL TEAM OF PERSONNEL, REPRESENTING A VARIETY 
OF WARFARE COMMUNITIES, RANKS AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE, HAS PREPARED 
A DRAFT NAVY ETHOS STATEMENT. THE STATEMENT IS AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW AT 
THE WEBSITE: WWW.ETHOS.NAVY.MIL, ALONG WITH A BRIEF ONLINE SURVEY TO 
CONTRIBUTE YOUR THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS.  
3. ALL COMMANDS AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENCOURAGED TO PROMOTE MILITARY 
AND CIVILIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE ETHOS SURVEY, WHICH CAN BE COMPLETED 
IN 5-10 MINUTES. A NAVY ETHOS 'BLOG' IS ALSO AVAILABLE AT THE WEBSITE 
FOR PARTICIPANTS TO EXCHANGE IDEAS IN A NON-ATTRIBUTION ENVIRONMENT 
BEYOND WHAT IS COVERED IN THE SURVEY. THE GOAL IS TO COLLECT FEEDBACK 
FROM A DIVERSE POPULATION OF PERSONNEL TO HELP SHAPE THE FINAL PRODUCT 
THAT WILL BE PROPOSED TO NAVY LEADERSHIP FOR ADOPTION.
4. ALTHOUGH DOD PKI CERTIFICATE INFORMATION (E.G. COMMON ACCESS CARD) 
IS REQUIRED TO ACCESS THE SURVEY AND BLOG, NO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE 
INFORMATION (PII) WILL BE COLLECTED AT ANY POINT WHILE USING THE ONLINE 
TOOLS. PLEASE REVIEW THE QUESTIONS CAREFULLY AND COMMENT WITHOUT 
RESERVE. FOR INDIVIDUALS UNABLE TO ACCESS THE WEBSITE DUE TO BANDWIDTH 
OR OTHER LIMITING FACTORS, THE SURVEY MAY ALSO BE OBTAINED BY SENDING 
AN E-MAIL TO THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS:  ETHOS.FCT(AT)NAVY.MIL. AN E-MAIL 
CONTAINING SURVEY QUESTIONS WILL BE SENT IN REPLY. 
5. IN THE COMING WEEKS, A SERIES OF VISITS AND "TOWN HALL" LIKE 
DISCUSSIONS ON ETHOS ARE PLANNNED AT VENUES THROUGHOUT NAVY, 
FACILITATED BY TEAMS OF MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN THE  
ETHOS PROJECT. THESE DISCUSSIONS WILL SERVE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL 
OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLABORATION ON ETHOS DEVELOPMENT AND COMPLEMENT DATA  
COLLECTION EFFORTS AFFORDED BY THE ONLINE SURVEY AND BLOG. COMMANDS AND 
ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE NOTIFIED SEPARATELY OF TOWN HALL SESSIONS.
6. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR EFFORTS IN HELPING MOLD THIS IMPORTANT  
PART OF OUR NAVY CULTURE. YOUR OPINION MATTERS!
