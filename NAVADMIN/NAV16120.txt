INSTRUCTION 1304.27, AWARD AND ADMINISTRATION OF SPECIAL DUTY ASSIGNMENT 
PAY.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces revised Special Duty Assignment Pay (SDAP) 
levels for the regular component, reserve component, full-time support (FTS) 
and qualified selected reserve enlisted personnel on active duty and 
supersedes reference (a).  The SDAP program enhances our Navy's ability to 
size, shape, and stabilize our force by providing a monetary incentive to 
encourage enlisted personnel with specific designated skills to apply their 
knowledge and experience to uniquely challenging assignments.

2.  Increases to existing levels are effective immediately. Reductions are 
effective 60 days from the release of this NAVADMIN. All changes to levels 
are summarized in paragraph 6 for ease of reference.  SDAP levels, new 
special duty assignments (SDA), SDAP reductions, and unit identification code 
(UIC) revisions are provided at the following website:
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/Pages/SRB.aspx.  Commands are responsible to 
ensure increases and decreases are submitted via their local servicing 
Personnel Support Detachments (PSD) or into the Navy Standard Integrated 
Personnel System.

3.  Commanding officers are required to certify that service members meet all 
qualifying criteria established by references (b), (c) and this NAVADMIN 
prior to receiving SDAP.  Qualification criteria includes:  All 
qualifications completed, including personal qualification standards and 
under instruction watches, and assigned to and working in a billet on the 
command's enlisted distribution verification process identified as an SDA.

4.  Each Sailor is eligible for only one SDAP entitlement at a time and, 
unless otherwise noted, commands must ensure the number of personnel 
receiving SDAP does not exceed the number of authorized SDAP billets.

5.  Commands holding SDAP billets are reminded that annual re-certification 
required by reference (b) begins in June.  Guidance for the re-certification 
process will be announced via separate correspondence.  Commands, via PSD if 
applicable, are responsible for making any rate adjustments as directed by 
this NAVADMIN.
