RMKS/1. This message is a Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Execution Order 
(EXORD) for events in support of the U.S. Navy's 80th anniversary 
commemoration of the Battle of Midway (BOM), beginning on 3 June and ending 
on 7 June. EXORD to be carried out in accordance with references (A) and (B). 
 
2.  Situation. 
    a. While chance may determine events, it is truly people who make 
history. 
    The determination, zeal, and valor shown by the U.S. Navy's personnel 
during the Battle of Midway multi-day engagement blunted the Imperial 
Japanese navy's striking force and its advance across the Pacific.  Navy 
strategy in this conflict leveraged the power of our aircraft carriers, 
sustaining sea control and shifting the paradigm of maritime power projection 
on to the carrier force. 
    b. Our remembrance of Midway illustrates how our battle achievements in 
    innovation, intelligence, and courage serve as a model and as inspiration 
as we continue to face the challenges of the future. 
 
3.  Mission. As much as possible and within the bounds of personnel safety, 
operational availability, and existing local, state, and federal restrictions 
on gatherings and travel, commands are directed to find creative ways to 
commemorate the 80th anniversary of the BOM. 
 
4.  Execution.

    preparations for the 80th BOM commemoration execution (3 June to 7 June). 
    Reference (B) provides guidance in executing events in support of the 
80th anniversary commemoration of BOM.
