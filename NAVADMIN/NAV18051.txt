3.  Commanding Officers (CO) are directed to:
    a.  Notify selectee.
    b.  Notify COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-92) via official correspondence not later 
than 10-days following release of this message of selectees who do not accept 
appointment.  Selectees who decline their commission within this 10-day 
period will be considered by the FY-19 Reserve Enlisted Advancement Selection 
Boards.  After the 10-day period PERS-802 will invalidate all FY-19 Navy 
Reserve LDO and CWO selectees' eligibility for the FY-19 Reserve Advancement 
Enlisted Selection Boards.
    c.  Notify PERS-92 not later than 10 days following release of this 
message of any selectee who is currently mobilized or will be mobilized prior 
to their scheduled commissioning date.
    d.  Per reference (a), ensure LDO and CWO selectees obtain a 
commissioning physical within the 90 days preceding the appointment month.  
Administer official physical fitness assessment (PFA) within 120 days of 
commissioning date and an additional Body Composition Assessment (BCA) within 
30 days prior to commissioning.  Submit commissioning physical, official PFA 
data, and BCA to PERS-92.
    e.  Hold appointment in abeyance if it is determined a selectee is no 
longer mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified, or if the 
selectee fails to meet current PFA requirements.  Immediately forward 
documentation citing reason to PERS-92.
    f.  Contact Officer Training Command, Newport, RI to obtain Direct 
Commission Officer Indoctrination Course (DCOIC) quota. Commanding Officers 
will ensure selectees attend DCOIC within 12 months of their commissioning 
date.  Selectees reporting to DCOIC will be required to pass a BCA and a 
third class swim qualification upon check in.  Failure of BCA upon check in 
will result in immediate disenrollment and possible loss of orders.  Swim 
failure will remediate.  Additional course information can be found at 
http://www.ocs.navy.mil/>ldo.html.  This link contains information concerning 
the course curriculum, base info, billeting info, uniform requirements, and 
commissioning pay entitlement procedures.

4.  Appointments will be permanent.

prohibited.  PERS-92 will deliver appointments under separate correspondence 
approximately 30 days prior to the commissioning date.
