SUBJ/ESTABLISHMENT OF ICCM RATE AND REDESIGNATION OF INTERIOR COMMUNICATIONS 
ELECTRICIAN E-3 AND BELOW SAILORS TO THE SEAMAN APPRENTICESHIP//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the establishment of the Interior 
Communications Electrician Master Chief (ICCM) rate and the redesignation of 
Interior Communications Electrician (IC) E-3 and below Sailors in the Seaman 
apprenticeship.  The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) has approved both of 
these initiatives which apply to active-duty and selected reserve Sailors in 
the IC rating.  Effective date of all changes will be 1 March 2014.  E-3 and 
below designated in the rating or in the IC apprenticeship shall convert 
uniform insignia NLT 1 May 2014. 

2.  Establishing a career path for the IC rating at the E-9 level completes 
the rating's shift from the Center for Naval Engineering (CNE) to the Center 
for Surface Combat Systems (CSCS) and aligns the IC rating with combat 
systems ratings.  Senior Chief Petty Officers in the Interior Communications 
Electrician rating (ICCSs) will no longer compete with Senior Chief 
Electrician's Mate (EMCSs) for advancement to E-9.  Anticipated benefits are 
career progression through E-9 maintained within parent rating and 
solidification of the rating's linkage to CSCS vice CNE.  This action further 
recognizes the differences in rating occupational standards and watch 
qualifications between Combat Systems and Engineering. 

3.  The first ICCMs will be selected from selection board eligible ICCSs by 
the FY-15 active-duty and reserve E-9 selection boards. 

4.  The seaman rating insignia is prescribed for IC E-1 to E-3 personnel.  
ICs in pay grades E-1 to E-3 may continue to wear the fireman insignia until 
advanced.  However, all IC E-1 to E-3 personnel shall convert uniform 
insignia NLT 1 May 2014. 

5.  To enable a smooth transition and eliminate a cost burden to affected 
Sailors, effective immediately, new accessions into the IC rating will wear 
the Seaman rating insignia.  

6.  This NAVADMIN does not modify any previous guidance concerning early 
separation, Fleet Reserve, conversion packages, or Career Waypoints-
Reenlistment requests.
