RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a), Secretary of 
Defense (SecDef) directed waiver requirements to mitigate the risk 
to the force due to the coronavirus disease 2019 in line with 
references (b) through (k) remain in effect.  This NAVADMIN 
delegates most casualty and mortuary travel waiver approval 
authority to the O-6 or GS-15 level with the specific exceptions to 
include high risk travel outside of U.S. and territories, travel by 
unvaccinated personnel, and unit and next of kin travel to observe 
dignified transfers (DT) at Dover Air Force Base (AFB), DE. 
Exception requests must take into consideration all receiving and 
originating location restrictions as well as airline restrictions. 
Commands shall maintain a record of all travel waiver decisions and 
forward denials to Navy Casualty Affairs (PERS-00C) to file in the 
case record. 
 
2.  Bedside Travel.  Invitational travel to the bedside of a 
casualty remains temporarily suspended unless a waiver is granted. 
Waivers may be approved by the first O-6 or GS-15 in the casualtys 
chain of command when all stages of travel are conducted within U.S. 
and territories.  Waivers when any stage of travel is outside of 
U.S. and territories must be approved by Deputy Chief of Naval 
Personnel (DCNP).  Travelers who self-fund travel will be reimbursed 
within the limits of the Joint Travel Regulations. 
 
3.  Casualty Assistance Calls Officer (CACO) Notifications and 
Casualty Assistance Support.  CACO notification and enduring 
assistance will be made in person between the hours of 0500-2359 
unless an exception is approved by PERS-00C.  Commander, Navy 
Installations Command (CNIC) Region Commanders (REGCOM) may direct 
phone notification or remote support when health or safety risks 
preclude safe in-person contact. 
 
4.  DT.  Family travel to witness a DT at Dover AFB remains temporarily 
suspended unless a waiver is granted.  Waivers must be approved by 
DCNP.  Unit member participation is limited to the Commander and Senior 
Enlisted Advisor or substitutes designated by the casualtys command.  When 
authorized by the Commander, Navy District Washington (NDW), the on-call flag 
officer will officiate the DT and the Navy carry team will support.  When the 
on-call flag officer or NDW carry team are unable to support, the Air Force 
Mortuary Affairs Operations (AFMAO) Commander or Deputy will officiate the DT 
and the AFMAO carry team will support. 
 
5.  Escorting Remains of Service Members and Civilian Employees. When remains 
are transported by military air or military-contract air, aircraft commanders 
will serve as the sole official escort. Exceptions to allow others to act as 
an escort of remains to include transport by commercial aircraft and ground 
transportation within U.S. and territories may be approved by the first O-6 
or GS-15 in the escorts chain of command.  The proposed escort must be fully 
immunized.  Exceptions for escorts with travel with any stage outside of U.S. 
and territories and for unimmunized escorts, must be approved by the 
DCNP.  The applicable CNIC REGCOM will assign a departure escort to travel 
with the remains to the departure airport and a receiving escort to travel 
with the remains from the arrival airport to the receiving funeral home or 
place of final disposition, unless the CNIC REGCOM assesses that the health 
and safety risk in the affected location(s) precludes the employment of a 
local escort. 
 
6.  Funeral Travel.  Funded family travel to funerals remains temporarily 
suspended until Department of Defense (DoD) travel restrictions are lifted 
unless a waiver is granted.  Waivers for funded family funeral travel may be 
approved by the first O-6 or GS-15 in the decedents chain of command when all 
stages of travel are conducted within U.S. and territories.  Waivers when any 
stage of travel is outside of U.S. and territories must be approved by DCNP. 
PERS-00C is the waiver authority for all past conflict cases. 
Eligible travelers who self-fund travel will be reimbursed within the limits 
of the Joint Travel Regulations. 
 
7.  Command Memorial Service Travel.  Command memorial service travel remains 
temporarily suspended until DoD travel restrictions are lifted unless a 
waiver is granted.   Non-DoD personnel attending command memorial services on 
a CNIC installation must have advance appropriate CNIC REGCOM 
approval.  Waivers for command memorial travel may be approved by the first 
O-6 or GS-15 in the decedents chain of command when all stages of travel are 
conducted within U.S. and territories.  Waivers when any stage of travel is 
outside of U.S. and territories must be approved by DCNP.  Eligible travelers 
who self-fund travel will be reimbursed within the limits of the Joint Travel 
Regulations. 
 
8.  Waivers.  Commands will use local approval procedures and submit approval 
documentation to PERS-00C at Mill_NavyTravelCell(at)navy.mil.   In all cases 
where waivers are granted, Sailors will strictly follow all Centers for 
Disease and Prevention restrictions and Navy guidance. 
 
9.  Taking care of our wounded, our Fallen and their families remains a 
sacred responsibility.  Commanders are encouraged to request assistance in 
determining a prospective travelers eligibility for travel benefits before 
granting a waiver.  Approval of bedside travel in particular should be 
carefully scrutinized since law specifically limits travel to those picked by 
the member themselves, typically listed on the members Record of Emergency 
Data and Dependency Application.  All honors details should be uniform in 
appearance while performing honors, therefore, all in the honors detail must 
be either masked or unmasked.
