NOT TO BE PHYSICALLY QUALIFIED OR OTHERWISE BECOMES INELIGIBLE FOR 
CONTINUATION IN THE PROGRAM PRIOR TO EXECUTING ORDERS, A QUALIFIED 
ALTERNATE WILL BE SELECTED.  THIS NOTIFICATION OFTEN COMES AT THE LAST

THOSE ASSIGNED TO 3-MONTH BOOST ARE ELIGIBLE FOR PCS ORDERS AFTER THE 
CONDITIONS OF PARAS 6A AND 6B HAVE BEEN MET, AND SHOULD MEET CONDITIONS 
OF PARAS 6C AND 6D AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO INCREASE CHANCES OF BEING 
ASSIGNED TO THEIR FIRST CHOICE UNIVERSITY.

STRATEN AT (850)452-9433/DSN 922.
