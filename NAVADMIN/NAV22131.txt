RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the fiscal year (FY) 2022 Aviation Command 
Retention Bonuses (ACRB) for the Active Component (AC), in line with 
references (a) and (b).  NAVADMIN 067/22 addresses the FY-
22 AC Aviation Department Head Bonus (ADHRB).

2.  A vital part of developing a total force strategy and maintaining combat 
readiness is to provide appropriate incentives to retain skilled personnel 
for critical Naval Aviation Enterprise
(NAE) billets.  The AC ACRB program incentivizes highly talented, hard-
working, Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers screened for aviation 
command to choose to remain on active duty.

3.  AC ACRB:
    a.  The AC ACRB is designed to retain those officers with the 
capabilities and command experience in our primary warfighting missions that 
are critical for the future of our service.  Our cadre of Commander (CDR) 
Commanding Officers (COs) lead our NAE today, and they are the major 
commanders and flag officers of tomorrow.  Their skills and leadership 
experience are essential to the success of the Navy.  The FY-22 ACRB 
incentivizes their continued service in follow on assignments requiring 
senior aviation leaders.
    b.  ACRB applicants must have screened on the FY-22 Aviation Command 
Screen Board (ACSB) as CO of an eligible operational (OP), operational 
training (OP-T) or special mission (SM) CDR command in order to apply.  
Eligible commands are those for which the annual ACSB selects officers to 
serve as CO, excluding second in grade/sequential/bonus/fleet replacement 
squadron commands.  Consult the FY-22 ACRB program information for specific 
eligibility criteria and limitations.  The application opportunity commences 
with the release of this NAVADMIN and closes on 31 August 2022.
    c.  All FY-22 ACRB contracts will be worth $100,000.  All eligible 
officers will receive an initial payment of $34,000 and 2 anniversary 
payments of $33,000.  Participation in the FY-22 ACRB obligates contractees 
to 3 years of obligated service to include full completion of a Post Command 
Commander (PCC) tour, which may be between 24 and 36 months depending on 
assignment.  ACRB obligation ends after 22 years of commissioned service, the 
projected rotation date of the assigned PCC tour or 3 years from contract 
acceptance date, whichever is later.  ACRB applications for those currently 
under ADHRB obligations will be accepted, held in abeyance and activated upon 
ADHRB contract expiration.

4.  Additional Aviation Bonus (AvB) Information:
    a.  Officers accepting ACRB contracts are not precluded from 
participating in the Career Intermission Program (CIP).  Officers interested 
in both ACRB and CIP should contact the ACRB program manager and their 
detailer for more information.
