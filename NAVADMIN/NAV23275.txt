RMKS/1. The Surface Navy Association (SNA) will hold its 36th Annual National 
Symposium in Arlington, VA, at the Hyatt Regency, Crystal City from 9 through 
11 January 2024. This year's theme is "THE FIGHT, THE FORCE, THE FUTURE!" 
 
2. The SNA Annual National Symposium provides an opportunity for discussions 
on a broad range of professional and career issues. This is a forum where 
personnel can discuss innovative solutions to current and future Surface 
Warfare challenges. 
 
3. Reference (a) designates SNA national symposium as a Tier 2 level non-DOD 
hosted conference, granting a designated agent approval authority if the 
conference cost does not exceed $500,000, per reference (b). SNA 2024 meets 
this threshold. Reference (c) approves Department of the Navy attendance at 
this conference. 
      a. All Navy participation in SNA 2024 shall be consistent with

         (2) Awards Recognition Lunch (Invitation only) 
         (3) CEO/Flag Officer Luncheon (Invitation only) 
             - If invited, attendees should consult with command 
             ethics counselor for assistance in determining whether 
attendance is permissible. 
         (4) Annual Banquet and Hall of Fame Induction 
            (a) Free to all active duty service personnel and government 
            civilians. To ensure an accurate meal count, active duty and 
            government civilians are asked to register and pay the $20 fee 
            online at https://navysna.org/. Participants will be reimbursed 
after check-in and attendance. 
            (b) OPNAV N9 Legal Counsel determined that free attendance 
            and acceptance of the Annual Banquet by all military 
            personnel and Navy Government Civilians is authorized. 
 
4. Registration information is available on the SNA website 
at http://www.navysna.org/. 
There is no charge to attend the SNA Seminar Sessions for Active Duty in 
Uniform and Government Civilians. All others are charged in accordance with 
respective status as determined when registering. 
 
5. TAD Travel. The estimated cost allocations for Temporary Additional Duty 
(TAD) travel are provided below. Reference (c) limits TAD attendance to 311 
individuals and attendance is controlled by OPNAV N96. Commands below are 
provided designated TAD quotas and must ensure both attendee and cost 
thresholds are not exceeded without prior approval from OPNAV N96. Additional 
TAD funds will not be provided. There is no Line of Accounting associated 
with this conference. All attendees should arrange for TAD funds through 
parent command.

This step is to ensure accurate numbers associated with the table 
above.  CNSP and CNSL CAG Offices will collate Fleet attendance, and 
promulgate an approved list.  Once members who registered through this site 
receive an approval email, they will be able to arrange DTS travel.  POCs are

event; this is approval to travel via DTS.  Symposium attendance should be 
arranged at http://www.navysna.org/. OPNAV N96 will manage overall 
participation to ensure attendee and cost thresholds are not exceeded without 
prior approval. POCs are LCDR Nick Detweiler at

extension forms to reduce lodging costs if applicable. Meals and lodging are 
reimbursed to attendees in a TAD status only at the authorized per diem rate.

vouchers accordingly. Local attendees who are able to attend at no cost to 
the government are authorized to file Local Defense Travel System claims.
