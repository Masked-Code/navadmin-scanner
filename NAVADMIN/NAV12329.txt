RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REF A, A NEW NAVY 
ACTIVE COMPONENT (AC) AND FULL TIME SUPPORT (FTS) TO SELECTED RESERVE (SELRES) 
DELAYED AFFILIATION PROGRAM (DAP).  THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS AC AND FTS ENLISTED 
SAILORS TO DELAY IN-RATE AFFILIATION WITH THE SELRES FOR UP TO 6 MONTHS AFTER 
SOFT EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE (SEAOS).  ELIGIBLE SAILORS WHO 
CHOOSE TO DELAY THEIR AFFILIATION DUE TO TRANSITIONAL CIVILIAN OBLIGATIONS, OR 
WHO CANNOT AFFILIATE DUE TO AN ABSENCE OF SELRES IN-RATE PERFORM-TO-SERVE 
(PTS) QUOTAS EFFECTIVE AT SEAOS, MAY REQUEST A FUTURE QUOTA VIA A RESERVATION 
SYSTEM MANAGED BY THE SELRES ENLISTED COMMUNITY MANAGER (ECM).  AC/FTS RATING

PROGRAM.

2.  IN RETURN FOR AN IN-RATE QUOTA RESERVATION, SAILORS MUST SATISFACTORILY 
PARTICIPATE IN A VOLUNTARY TRAINING UNIT (VTU) OR VARIABLE PARTICIPATION UNIT 
(VPU) OF THE INDIVIDUAL READY RESERVE (IRR) UNTIL THEIR APPROVED SELRES 
AFFILIATION DATE.  UPON COMPLETION OF THEIR AFFILIATION DELAY, MEMBERS WILL BE 
ACCESSED INTO THE SELRES BY THEIR LOCAL NAVY RECRUITER.  ONCE AFFILIATED IN 
THE SELRES, SAILORS QUALIFY TO RECEIVE A TEMPORARY DEFERMENT FROM INVOLUNTARY 
MOBILIZATION COMMENCING ON THEIR AFFILIATION DATE PER REF A.

3.  BASIC ELIGIBILITY.  ALL SEPARATING AC/FTS ENLISTED SAILORS ARE ELIGIBLE

ELIGIBILITY UNDER CONTINUOUS SERVICE CONDITIONS.
    D.  MEET PHYSICAL QUALIFICATIONS PER REF A FOR AFFILIATION AND RETENTION
