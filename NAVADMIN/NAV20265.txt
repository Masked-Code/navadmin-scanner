RMKS/1.  October is National Cybersecurity Awareness Month.  While 
cybersecurity is always a Navy priority, we increase our focus on it during 
October to remind you of its importance, and to equip you with tools to 
safeguard the Navy at work and defend yourself at home. 
 
2.  To win across the full range of military operations in this era of Great 
Power Competition, we must connect Navy and Joint sensors and shooters in a 
battle network that enables our forces to get from threat detection to 
decisive action as quickly as possible.  The systems, networks and data that 
enable this capability are as critical as weapons  without them we cannot 
compete, deter, and win. 
 
3.  Our adversaries understand this.  They have become more confident in 
challenging us below the level of military conflict by stealing our data, and 
developing ways to compromise Navy systems and networks, including those that 
control our ships, aircraft, weapons, and infrastructure. 
 
4.  The connectedness we need increases our lethality but it also increases 
shared risk.  With a foothold inside our networks, adversaries can quickly 
move to more vital targets.  When they have this capability, a mistake by one 
individual puts others at risk.  Because the stakes are so high in this 
networked environment, adhering to cybersecurity policies and best practices 
requires an ALL HANDS approach to keep the Navy and our nation 
safe.  Cybersecurity best practices also provide protection against hackers 
intent on exploiting smart phones, personal computers and other consumer 
computing devices. 
 
5.  During October, we will publish content on the Navys social media 
platform and on the American Forces Network as part of the national campaign 
for raising cybersecurity awareness.  Use these materials to understand the 
threats we face and how to protect against them.  Each week will have a 
different theme: 
    a.  Week One:  If You Connect It, Protect 
    b.  Week Two:  Securing Devices at Home and Work 
    c.  Week Three:  Secure Teleworking 
    d.  Week Four:  The Future of Connected Devices 
 
6.  For easy access to this content, go to https://www.doncio.navy.mil and 
select Cybersecurity Awareness Month announcement.  Many of the excellent 
cybersecurity resources from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Agency will be reposted at https://www.cisa.gov/national-cyber-security 
-awareness-month. 
 
7.  We have invested heavily in capabilities to protect Navy networks, 
systems, 
and data, and our cybersecurity defenders stop attacks daily, but you are 
part 
of the cyber fight too.  Every time you log onto a system or network  at home 
or at work  you are on the front lines of the cyber battlespace.  I 
appreciate your commitment to keeping the Navy safe by following 
cybersecurity best practices and policy. 
 
8.  Request widest dissemination.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until 
cancelled or superseded.
