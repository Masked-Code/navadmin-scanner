RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 flight hour 
verification process for conditional Aviation Incentive Pay (AvIP) and 
Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay for Flying (HDIP-F).  Per reference (a), all 
recipients of conditional AvIP or HDIP-F are required to track flight hours 
per month, and report them to Navy Personnel Command (NPC) AvIP Program 
Manager (PERS-435).  Commanding officers and other reporting seniors are 
responsible for verifying the accuracy and completeness of flight hour 
verification letters for officers under their charge, and reporting such by 
endorsing verification letters on command letterhead.  Templates for the 
reporting senior endorsement, as well as an example of the verification 
letter, can be found on the NPC website at 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Detailing/Officer/Pers-43-
Aviation/OCM/Monthly-Flight-Pay/. 
 
2.  Conditional AvIP may be paid to those aeronautically designated 
officers in the following categories: 
    a.  Aeromedical officers. 
    b.  Aviation officers who would otherwise be eligible for continuous 
AvIP, but have not met the months of operational flying requirements at the 
12-year or 18-year gate. 
    c.  Aviation officers who have completed the continuous AvIP program 
after 22 years (after passing the 18-year low gate) or 25 years (after 
passing the 18-year high gate). 
 
3.  In order to be eligible for conditional AvIP, an officer must be under 
orders to Duty in a Flying Status Involving Operational or Training Flights 
(DIFOPS), must occupy a billet designated XXX1 or XXX2 (a DIFOPS billet), and 
must fly the minimum hours prescribed in reference (b). 
 
4.  HDIP-F may be paid to non-aeronautically designated officers required by 
competent orders to participate in regular and frequent aerial flights as 
crew or non-crewmembers.  HDIP-F eligibility requires a non-aeronautically 
designated officer to be under orders to duty involving flying as a technical 
observer.  All must fly the minimum hours prescribed in reference 
(b).  Officers entitled to AvIP are not entitled to HDIP-F. 
 
5.  Any officer who received any conditional AvIP or HDIP-F payment during 
FY23 is required to provide total flight hours, by month, from 1 October 2022 
through 30 September 2023 to PERS-435A no later than 30 November 
2023.  Required format for flight hour submissions and commanding officer 
endorsement letters are provided in the templates located on the NPC website 
at  https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Detailing/Officer/Pers-
43-Aviation/OCM/Monthly-Flight-Pay/. 
If a member did not complete the minimum flight hour requirements as 
established in reference (b), unearned AvIP/HDIP-F will be recouped.   
Underpayments will also be corrected.  If no flight hours are submitted by 30 
November 2023, the officer's entitlement to AvIP or HDIP-F will stop and he 
or she will forfeit the entire FY23 entitlement to conditional AvIP or HDIP-
F.  The repayment process of the AvIP received will be initiated as 
applicable.  It is the responsibility of each individual recipient of 
conditional AvIP/HDIP-F to ensure that the flight hour verification letter 
and endorsement are completed in line with reference (a), to deliver them on 
time by e-mail to PERS-435, and to verify that they have been received by 
PERS-435 (see e-mail contacts below). 
 
6.  Members must send original flight hour submissions and command 
endorsements by e-mail to the program manager at avipandavb.fct@navy.mil.   
If e-mail is not possible, please fax to 901-874-2721 or mail hard copies to: 
 
    Commander, Navy Personnel Command 
    PERS-435 
    5720 Integrity Drive 
    Millington, TN 38055-4300 
 
7.  Once flight hours are received, verification of hours flown and monthly 
entitlement(s) earned will be calculated by PERS-435. Overpayment and 
underpayment cases will be forwarded to Defense Financing and Accounting 
Service for appropriate corrective action. Negotiation of repayment plans for 
recoupment may be discussed directly with the member's servicing personnel 
office. 
 
8.  Point of contact for AvIP and HDIP-F policy is LCDR Lindsay McCammond 
(PERS-435), at (901) 874-3484 or via e-mail at avipandavb.fct@navy.mil. 
 
9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled.
