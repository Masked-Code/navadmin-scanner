SUBJ/STAND-UP OF INTELLIGENCE TYCOM FUNCTIONS WITHIN NAVAL NETWORK 
WARFARE COMMAND (NETWARCOM)// 
RMKS/1. EFFECTIVE JUNE 2008, NETWARCOM WILL ASSUME FLEET INTELLIGENCE 
TYPE COMMANDER (TYCOM) RESPONSIBILITIES IN ADDITION TO ITS INFORMATION 
OPERATIONS (IO), NETWORKS AND SPACE MISSIONS. NETWARCOM IS ALSO TASKED 
TO SERVE AS THE FLEET ADVOCATE FOR INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE AND 
RECONNAISANCE (ISR) CAPABILITIES AND READINESS. THIS ACTION RESPONDS TO 
CNO GUIDANCE TASK 5.1.1 "CONTINUE REALIGNMENT OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE AT 
ECHELON III INTO THE EXISTING TYCOM (NETWARCOM) AND THE EXISTING 
ENTERPRISE (NNFE)." OPNAV AND USFF WILL COORDINATE APPROPRIATE 
REALIGNMENT OF PERSONNEL/RESOURCES TO AFFECT THIS CHANGE.
2. MISSION. NETWARCOM ASSUMES THE ADDITIONAL MISSIONS OF OPTIMIZING 
INTELLIGENCE READINESS ACROSS ALL NAVY WARFARE AREAS, AND SERVING AS 
THE OPERATING FORCES' ADVOCATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT, INTEGRATION AND 
FIELDING OF ISR SYSTEMS. NETWARCOM WILL ASSUME THE LEAD FOR PROVIDING 
SYNCHRONIZED AND INTEGRATED INTELLIGENCE MANPOWER, EQUIPMENT AND 
TRAINING TO FLEET/NAVAL COMPONENT COMMANDERS (MARITIME 
HEADQUARTERS/MARITIME OPERATIONS CENTERS (MHQ/MOC)), AND ALL NAVY TYPE 
COMMANDERS. NETWARCOM WILL ENSURE THAT NAVY INTELLIGENCE (INCLUDING 
SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE) IS FULLY SYNCHRONIZED WITH IO, NETWORKS AND SPACE 
CAPABILITIES IN DELIVERING DECISION SUPERIORITY TO THE WARFIGHTER.
3. RESPONSIBILITY. NETWARCOM WILL CONTINUE TO REPORT TO COMMANDER, U.S. 
FLEET FORCES COMMAND; HOWEVER, IN ADDITION TO CURRENT NETWORK, IO AND 
SPACE RESPONSIBILITIES, ALSO HAS DIRECT LIAISON AUTHORITY WITH ALL 
FLEET/NAVAL COMPONENT COMMANDERS, MHQ/MOCS, AND NAVY TYPE COMMANDERS ON 
ALL INTELLIGENCE AND ISR CAPABILITY AND READINESS MATTERS. NETWARCOM 
WILL SERVE AS THE PRIMARY INTELLIGENCE AND ISR CAPABILITY AND READINESS 
ADVISOR TO COMMANDER USFF, FLEET/NCCS, MHQ/MOCS, AND NAVY TYPE 
COMMANDERS; AND WILL ADVISE USFFC REGARDING INTEGRATED AUTHORITATIVE 
FLEET WARFIGHTING, READINESS, AND PERSONNEL CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR 
INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE. NETWARCOM WILL NOT BE 
THE CONDUIT FOR CURRENT/OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE TO THE FLEET, WHICH 
WILL REMAIN WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF COMBATANT COMMANDERS (CCDR) AND THE 
OFFICE OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE (ONI); HOWEVER, NETWARCOM WILL DIRECTLY 
ENGAGE OPNAV N2 TO ENSURE CAPABILITIES AND PROCESSES ARE IN PLACE TO 
DELIVER THE BEST CURRENT/OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE TO THE FLEET. 
COMMANDER NETWARCOM HAS DESIGNATED RDML SAM COX THE DIRECTOR OF FLEET 
INTELLIGENCE (DFI), WITH THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF RESPONDING TO 
REQUESTS FOR SUPPORT FROM, COORDINATING WITH, AND PROVIDING ADVICE TO 
ALL FLEET/NCCS AND NAVY TYPE COMMANDERS, AS WELL AS WORKING TO ENSURE 
INTELLIGENCE READINESS FOR MHQ/MOCS.
4. BACKGROUND. FLEET INTELLIGENCE AND ISR HAVE PROVEN VERY SUCCESSFUL 
IN MULTIPLE COMBAT OPERATIONS IN THE LAST DECADE, AND SIGNIFICANT 
IMPROVMENTS IN TRAINING AND READINESS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED AS A RESULT OF 
LESSONS LEARNED. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT ORGANIZATION AND PROCESS FOR 
GENERATING INTELLIGENCE AND ISR READINESS IS NOT COHERENT ACROSS ALL 
NAVY WARFARE AREAS, DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR ADEQUATE ISR ACQUISITION RISK 
ASSESSMENT, AND WILL NOT KEEP PACE WITH THE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND 
DYNAMIC POTENTIAL THREAT ENVIRONMENTS OF THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, CNO HAS 
DIRECTED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE ALIGNMENT, AND THE 
ASSIGNMENT OF INTELLIGENCE TYCOM AND FLEET ISR ADVOCACY FUNCTIONS TO 
NETWARCOM IS A KEY PART OF THIS INTELLIGENCE TRANSFORMATION. GENERATING 
AND SUSTAINING THE WORLD'S BEST INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY, FULLY 
INTEGRATED WITH IO, NETWORKS AND SPACE, IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR 
COMMANDERS IN ALL NAVY WARFARE AREAS TO WIN DECISIVELY ACROSS THE FULL 
SPECTRUM OF CONFLICT, IN ANY JOINT OR COALITION ENVIRONMENT. THE 
PARTNERSHIP OF ALL FLEET/NCCS AND NAVY TYPE COMMANDERS WILL BE KEY TO 
SUCCESS OF THIS ENDEAVOR.
