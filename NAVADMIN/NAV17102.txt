NARR/REF A IS GENADMIN, THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER 
(SSN) REDUCTION PLAN.  REF B IS OPNAVINST 5350.4D, NAVY ALCOHOL AND DRUG 
ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL.//

RMKS/1.  The Navy Drug Screening Program (NDSP) collection software version 
5.4 (NDSP v5.4) has been released and replaces an individual social security 
number (SSN) with the Department of Defense (DoD) Electronic Data Interchange 
Personal Identifier (EDIPI) (commonly referred to as the DoD Identification 
(ID) number found on the common access card).  This NAVADMIN provides 
amplifying guidance on the SSN reduction plan for identification purposes 
within the drug testing program in line with references (a) and (b).  
Reference (a) identifies acceptable uses of the SSN within the DoD and 
mandates uses of alternative identifiers to replace current uses of the DOD 
SSN.  This NAVADMIN outlines specific actions to further strengthen 
protection against potential compromise of personally identifiable 
information.

2.  In line with reference (a), the DOD ID number will be used for 
identification purposes during urinalysis collection with the exception of 
areas where personnel being tested do not have an EDIPI assigned or network 
capability.

3.  Echelon 2 and 3 commanders are to monitor implementation of NDSP v5.4 
through their alcohol and drug control officers (ADCO).  ADCOs will provide 
routine status updates to Navy Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Office until 
all activities under their area of responsibility report receipt and use of 
NDSP v5.4.

4.  NDSP v5.4 is available for download by ADCOs and users of the internet 
Forensic Toxicology Drug Testing Laboratory
https://iftdtl.amedd.army.mil/.  For questions contact NDSP support desk at 
(901) 874-4204/DSN 312 or via e-mail at mill_ndsp(at)navy.mil.

5.  This NAVADMIN is applicable to all active and reserve component 
activities including Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps units.

6.  Point of contact is Mrs. Lanorfeia Parker, OPNAV N170, who can be reached
