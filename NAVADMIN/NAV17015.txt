postponed.  Target release date for introduction of the Navy fitness suit at 
Recruit Training Command (RTC), Great Lakes is 1 April 2017, with fleet 
availability for personal purchase at Navy Exchange (NEX) Uniform Centers and 
Uniform Call Centers to follow.  A future NAVADMIN will provide an update on

4.  Female Dress Covers.  The deadline for mandatory wear of the alternate

(CPO) as directed by reference (b) is extended from 31 October 2016 to 31

the NWU Type III fielding plan.

10.  Uniform Regulations Update.  The Navy Uniform Matters Office (UMO) is 
committed to providing quality content and modern depiction of Navy uniform 
policies and uniform components via its website. The website modernization 
initiative is underway and serves to enhance rapid dissemination of 
information regarding uniform policy changes, improved user experience, and 
to post updates of new uniform features and illustrations.  The UMO website 
update is part of a broader collaborative initiative starting with color 
illustrations and timely updates of the latest uniform policies.  To ensure 
we are addressing the needs of the Navy fleet input, recommendations and 
feedback are welcomed and encouraged.  Future changes will encompass

received from the fleet requesting policy change, update or clarification.
