RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN expands on the information promulgated in reference 
(a), regarding the Navy transition to electronic navigation based on the 
International Hydrographic Office S-57 Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) 
standard. 
 
2.  The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has commenced 
production of a global portfolio of ENC, Additional Military Layers (AML) and 
Submarine ENC (SMENC).  These products will ultimately replace Digital 
Nautical Charts (DNC), Tactical Ocean Data (TOD) and submarine unique 
navigation products.  The Navy will transition from DNC to ENC by the end of 
Fiscal Year (FY) 2025.  The Navy will also transition TOD0 and TOD4 to AML by 
the end of FY-25.  For submerged navigation, NGA will transition all TOD2 
areas to SMENC by the end of FY-25 covering approximately 80 percent of 
global SMENC coverage.  The remaining submarine unique coverage areas will be 
converted to SMENC by the end of FY-32. 
 
3.  Current NGA ENC portfolio, approximately 30 percent of global coverage, 
is available on a single Digital Video Disc (DVD) monthly.  Vessels should 
receive this disc from Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) as part of their normal 
subscription per Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command and Commander, U.S. 
Pacific Fleet geospatial allowances.  If vessels are not receiving the DVD on 
a monthly basis, contact DLA to request ENC Worldcover 
(NRN:  ENCDXWRLDCVER01, NSN:  7644016905742). 
 
4.  NGA plans to discontinue production and maintenance of their SNC 
portfolio starting in calendar year 2022.  Hardcopy charts created from ENC, 
known as Certified Printed ENC (CPENC), will be certified for navigation and 
provided by NGA upon request.  CPENC will be used to mitigate gaps created by 
foreign Hydrographic Offices SNC cancellations and Navy needs during the 
transition to electronic navigation.  Post 2025, CPENC will only be available 
to support small scale International Charts, General Charts, Littoral 
Planning Charts, and emergent crisis support. 
 
5.  Navy programs relying on DNC, TOD or SNC for navigation or any other 
purposes shall plan for the termination of these products prior to FY-25 and 
inform OPNAV N2N6E via their Type Commander (TYCOM) of unmitigated adverse 
impacts.  Ships, submarines and commands equipped per references (b) and (c) 
should begin to use ENC when authorized.  All other systems (e.g., C2, 
mission planning, etc.) should commence using ENC if capable.  All commands 
are encouraged to submit recommendations for AML requirements to their TYCOM 
for consideration.
