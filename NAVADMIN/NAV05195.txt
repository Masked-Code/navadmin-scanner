SUBJ/ENLISTED SUPERVISOR RETENTION PAY PROGRAM//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  NAVADMIN 253/04 ANNOUNCED THE ROLLOUT OF THE
ENLISTED SUPERVISOR RETENTION PAY (ESRP) PROGRAM AS A CRITICAL
ELEMENT IN THE NAVY S HUMAN CAPITAL STRATEGY.  OVER THE PAST EIGHT
MONTHS THIS PROGRAM HAS PROVEN TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN ENCOURAGING
SENIOR ENLISTED PERSONNEL, IN CERTAIN CRITICAL SKILLS, THROUGH
CAREER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES, TO CONTINUE NAVAL SERVICE IN LEADERSHIP
ROLES THAT ARE PARAMOUNT TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR MISSION.
2.  SAILORS ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR
REENLISTMENT INCENTIVES AVAILABLE UNDER THE SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT
BONUS (SRB) PROGRAM.
3.  THIS MESSAGE SUPERSEDES THE AWARD LEVELS PROMULGATED IN NAVADMIN
253/04, AND ESTABLISHES NEW ESRP AWARD LEVELS EFFECTIVE THE DATE OF
THIS NAVADMIN FOR SAILORS IN ZONE C WHO HOLD ESRP-DESIGNATED NEC S.

DECREASES IN AWARD LEVELS.  ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN
NAVADMIN 253/04 REMAIN IN EFFECT.  FURTHER PROGRAM DETAILS ARE
