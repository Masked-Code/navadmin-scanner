SUBJ/FAMILYGRAM 06-11 - FAMILY FINANCES//

RMKS/1.  THE HOLIDAY SEASON IS UPON US.  IT IS A WONDERFUL TIME FOR FAMILY 
GATHERINGS WITH MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR RELAXATION AND ENTERTAINMENT.  PROPER 
HOLIDAY PLANNING AND SAFE TRAVELING IS THE BEST GIFT YOU CAN GIVE YOUR 
FAMILIES AND FRIENDS.
HOLIDAY PERIODS CAN BE PARTICULARLY STRESSFUL WITH ADDITIONAL SOCIAL AND 
FAMILY REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS INCREASED FINANCIAL PRESSURES.  UNFORTUNATELY, 
THIS SEASON CAN HAVE DEVASTATING EFFECTS ON FINANCES WITHOUT PROPER PLANNING.  
INCLUDED IN THIS FAMILYGRAM ARE TIPS AND RESOURCES FOR A COMPREHENSIVE 
CONTROLLED SPENDING APPROACH AND PLANNING FOR A BRIGHTER FINANCIAL FUTURE.

2.  FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTER (FFSC) UNDERLINES THAT DURING THIS HOLIDAY 
SEASON, CONSUMER DEBT CAN ACCUMULATE TO UNMANAGEABLE LEVELS, DRIVING PERSONAL 
FINANCES INTO THE RED.
TWO WORDS CAN INSULATE YOU FROM GOING DOWN THE PATH OF LESS WEALTH AND MORE 
DEBT - "PLAN NOW!"
    A.  KNOW YOUR FINANCIAL STATUS -- DETERMINE HOW MUCH SAVINGS, DEBT, AND 
INCOME YOU HAVE; BE MINDFUL OF A SOLID FINANCIAL REGIMEN; MAKE AND FOLLOW A 
SOUND BUDGET.
     B.  BE REALISTIC IN YOUR BUDGET PLANNING.  DISCUSS THIS WITH YOUR FAMILY 
SO THEY DO NOT HAVE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS.
     C.  DETERMINE HOW MUCH YOU ARE GOING TO SPEND THIS HOLIDAY SEASON.  THINK 
OF HOW MUCH YOU SPENT LAST YEAR AND DECIDE IF YOU CAN STILL AFFORD THAT 
PATTERN OR LIFESTYLE.
     D.  TRY USING CASH INSTEAD OF CREDIT CARDS.  IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO HAND 
OVER OUR HARD EARNED CASH THAN SWIPE A PLASTIC CARD.  WHEN USING A CREDIT 
CARD, MAKE SURE YOU CAN PAY BACK THE DEBT WITHOUT BURDEN.  SOME CREDIT CARDS 
HAVE AN ACCOUNT FEATURE THAT SENDS TEXT OR EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS WHEN YOU ARE 
APPROACHING A PRE-DETERMINED LIMIT.
     E.  DO WHAT IS BEST FOR YOUR SITUATION.  DON'T BE INFLUENCED BY THE 
ACTIONS OF OTHERS AND RESIST MEDIA HYPE.
     F.  MAKE A LIST FOR PURCHASES; AVOID IMPULSE BUYS.
     G.  AFTER THE HOLIDAY SEASON, RECALCULATE YOUR BUDGET AND WRITE DOWN 
REALISTIC FINANCIAL GOALS.  INCLUDE HOW MUCH IT WILL COST AND HOW LONG IT WILL 
TAKE TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR GOALS.
     H.  OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE.  THERE IS AN ARRAY OF FREE ONLINE 
FINANCIAL TOOLS TO HELP YOU MAKE SMART FINANCIAL DECISIONS.  FOR TRUSTED IN-
PERSON ADVICE, FFSC FINANCIAL COUNSELORS, COMMAND FINANCIAL SPECIALISTS AND 
THE OR NAVY/MARINE CORPS RELIEF SOCIETY ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR ASSISTANCE 
AND GUIDANCE.

3.  IF YOU SEEK OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE, FFSCS OFFER SEVERAL PERSONAL FINANCIAL 
MANAGEMENT CLASSES AND SEMINARS FOR SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES.  THEY
