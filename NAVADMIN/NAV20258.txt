considered to have accepted the promotion on the date indicated.  An officer 
who chooses to decline promotion must submit the declination in writing to

reverted to enlisted status within 90 days of projected promotion date. 
 
3.  The commanding officer (CO), the Secretary of the Navy or his designee, 
has the authority to delay projected promotions.  Upon the exercise of a 
delay, the officer shall be notified in writing before the effective date of 
the promotion, and not be tendered the promoting appointment.  The delay 
authority will immediately forward the notification of delay with supporting 
documentation to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-83), copy to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806). 
 
4.  COs are reminded of their responsibility to ensure the officers they are 
promoting are mentally, physically, morally and professionally qualified in 
accordance with section 624 of title 10, U.S. Code.  Per reference (a), 
officers are ineligible for promotion if they have failed the most recent 
Physical Fitness Assessment. COs shall verify the promoting officer's

officers promotion in accordance with paragraph 3 of this NAVADMIN, if 
required. 
 
5.  Prepare a Delivery of Temporary/Permanent Appointment (NAVPERS form 
1421/7) (Rev 10-13).  Use this NAVADMIN as reference (a).  Use section 624 of 
title 10, U.S. Code as reference (b), for permanent lieutenants and 
above.  Use section 578 of title 10, U.S. Code as reference (b), for chief 
warrant officers.  Use sections 624 and 8139 of title 10, U.S. Code as 
reference (b), for limited duty officer promotion to lieutenant.  For limited 
duty officers, acceptance of the appointment is acceptance of permanent 
appointment as a limited duty officer.  Mail the completed form to 
COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806). 
 
6.  Officers should review reference (c) for minimum time-in-grade 
requirements for purposes of voluntary retirement.  Full time support

from active-duty under reference (d) may accept promotion without incurring 
any additional active-duty obligation.
