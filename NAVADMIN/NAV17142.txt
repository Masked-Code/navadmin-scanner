MSGID/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/N1/JUN//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the FY-17 Full Time Support (FTS) Aviation 
Department Head Retention Bonus (ADHRB) program.  A vital part of developing 
a total force strategy and maintaining combat readiness is to provide 
appropriate incentives to retain skilled personnel for critical naval 
aviation enterprise billets.  The FTS program provides selected bonuses as an 
incentive to eligible pilots and naval flight officers (NFO) through 
department head (DH) billets.

2.  The FY-17 FTS ADHRB program continues the bonus system of previous years 
that is tied directly to force structure and targets initial eligible 
aviators.  Annual rates are listed below and vary by community from $5,000 to 
$25,000 for squadron DH.  DH retention bonuses will be paid in equal annual 
installments.  The following rates are for squadron department head/wing 
staff contracts:

    HM  Pilot              $15,000/YR    (INCREASED $5,000/YR)

    HSM  Pilot             $15,000/YR

between 1 October 2016 and the release of this NAVADMIN are eligible to apply 
for a limited time.  Signed contracts must be received by Augmentation 
Management Division (PERS-46) within 30 days of the release of this NAVADMIN.
