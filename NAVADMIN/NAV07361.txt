DOCUMENTED IN THE OFFICER FITNESS REPORT, THE ICF, OTHER QAI RECORDS,

PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATELY TIED TO INADEQUATE PROFESSIONAL 
PERFORMANCE THAN TO OTHER ASPECTS OF MILITARY PERFORMANCE.  CO?S ARE

THE PRIMARY SPECIALTY FOR WHICH THE RN-ISP WAS ORIGINALLY AUTHORIZED, 
EXCEPT WHEN THE OFFICER IS ASSIGNED TO DUTY UNDER UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES 
AS DESCRIBED IN PARA 440.3.B. ABOVE.
    2.  TO DENY OR TERMINATE AN EXISTING RN-ISP AGREEMENT, THE CO MUST 
RECOMMEND TO CHBUMED-M1C1, IN WRITING, THE TERMINATION, OR DENIAL OF 
RN-ISP.  IN THE CORRESPONDENCE, THE CO MUST STATE THE REASON FOR DENIAL 
OR TERMINATION, AND ENCLOSE ANY SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION.  TERMINATION

THE TERMINATION OR DENIAL.
    3.  AN OFFICER MAY APPEAL THE DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF RN-ISP.  
UPON NOTIFICATION, THE OFFICER MUST BE GIVEN 10 WORKING DAYS TO SUBMIT 
AN APPEAL VIA HIS OR HER CHAIN OF COMMAND TO CHBUMED.  IN FORWARDING 
THE APPEAL, THE CO MUST PROVIDE AN ENDORSEMENT AND COPIES OF ALL 
PERTINENT DOCUMENTS NOT ALREADY SUBMITTED WITH THE ORIGINAL REQUEST FOR 
TERMINATION OR DENIAL.
    4.  CHBUMED (OR DESIGNEE) MUST CONVENE A SPECIAL PAY REVIEW BOARD

OR DENIAL OF RN-ISP MUST BE FOR A MINIMUM PERIOD OF ONE YEAR.

SECNAVINST 1920.6C.
444.  RECOUPMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS

FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES:
        A.  DEATH OR DISABILITY WHICH IS NOT THE RESULT OF MISCONDUCT,

ABSENCE.
        B.  SEPARATION FROM MILITARY SERVICE BY OPERATION OF LAW OR 
REGULATIONS OF THE DOD OR SERVICE REGULATIONS OTHER THAN SEPARATION FOR 
MISCONDUCT.  INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION FOR TWICE FAILING OF SELECTION TO 
THE NEXT GRADE IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SEPARATION FROM MILITARY SERVICE BY 
OPERATION OF LAW FOR WHICH RECOUPMENT OF RN-ISP WOULD NOT OCCUR.
         C.  IN OTHER CASES WHEN UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT WAIVER 
OF THE RECOUPMENT REQUIREMENTS, OFFICERS MAY SUBMIT WAIVER REQUESTS 
WITH SUPPORTING JUSTIFICATION TO NAVPERSCOM (PERS-48).
     2.  IN THE EVENT AN OFFICER DIES BEFORE HE OR SHE RECEIVES THE 
FULL AMOUNT OF ISP, OR BEFORE THE OFFICER COMPLETES THE ASSIGNMENT FOR 
WHICH ISP IS PAYABLE (AND DEATH IS NOT CAUSED BY THE MEMBER'S 
MISCONDUCT), THE UNPAID/UNEARNED BALANCE OF THE ISP SHALL BE PAYABLE IN 
THE SETTLEMENT OF THE DECEASED MEMBER'S FINAL MILITARY PAY ACCOUNT 
(UNPAID ISP SHALL BE PAYABLE IN LUMP SUM).  IF DEATH IS DETERMINED TO 
BE VOLUNTARY OR THE RESULT OF THE MEMBER'S OWN MISCONDUCT, TERMINATION 
OF ANY FUTURE PAYMENT AND PRORATION OR RECOUPMENT OF THE ISP, AS 
APPLICABLE, WILL BE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROCEDURES ESTABLISHED FOR 
MEMBERS WHOSE INABILITY TO COMPLETE A CONTRACTED PERIOD OF SERVICE IS 
VOLUNTARY OR THE RESULT OF MISCONDUCT.
