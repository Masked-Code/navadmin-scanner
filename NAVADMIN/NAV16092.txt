DECISION MEMORANDUM 003-05:  ENLISTED ADVANCED EDUCATION SERVICE 
OBLIGATION.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits applications and provides guidance for the 
FY-16 Advanced Education Voucher (AEV) Program.

2.  The AEV Program offers advanced education opportunities and provides 
financial assistance to senior enlisted personnel (E-7 to E-9) to complete a 
baccalaureate or master's Navy-relevant degree in designated areas of study 
through off-duty education.  Applicants should be available to commence their 
studies in the 2016 Fall term.  A Navy selection board will convene in June 
2016.

3.  The AEV Program supports the Professional Military Education Continuum 
announced in reference (a).  Participants in the AEV Program will be provided 
funding for tuition, books, and related fees for completion of the advanced 
degrees within the following guidelines and funding limits:
    a.  Baccalaureate Degree:   Applicants  must have either an associate's 
degree from an institution of higher learning accredited by an agency 
recognized by the Department of Education or the equivalent amount of college 
credit already earned and applicable to the Navy-relevant degree being 
sought.  Funding limits are a maximum of 6,700 dollars per fiscal year for up 
to 36 months from the date of signing a letter of acceptance, not to exceed
20,000 dollars total program cost.
    b.  Masters Degree:  Applicants must have a baccalaureate degree from an 
institution of higher learning accredited by an agency recognized by the 
Department of Education and only Navy-relevant master's degrees will be 
considered.  Funding limits are a maximum of 20,000 dollars per fiscal year 
for up to 24 months from the date of signing a letter of acceptance, not to 
exceed 40,000 dollars total program cost.
    c.  Other:  AEV is not authorized for courses used to earn an additional 
degree at the same or lower education level.  AEV and tuition assistant 
benefits may not be combined and reimbursement for any educational expenses 
incurred prior to participation in AEV is not authorized.
    d.  Service Obligation:  Per reference (b), upon completion of, or 
withdrawal from, education for which any authorized expenses were paid, 
participants shall agree to remain on active-duty for a period equal to three 
times the number of months of education completed or three years, whichever 
is less.  This obligation is discharged concurrently with any other service 
obligation program participants may have already incurred.  This agreement 
does not obligate the Navy to retain a member on active duty.  If a program 
participant fails to complete the period of active duty specified in the 
agreement, such member will reimburse the United States for the cost of the 
advanced education received, prorated for the obligated time served.

4.  The Navy is looking for superior performing active-duty senior enlisted 
personnel (E-7 to E-9) with strong upward mobility potential with the 
following qualifications to apply for the program:
    a.  Time in Service:  E-7 with no more than 17 years; E-8 with no more 
than 19 years; and E-9 with no more than 23 years.
    b.  Eligibility:  Applicants should be transferring to, or currently on 
shore duty with sufficient time ashore to complete a baccalaureate or 
master's degree program.  Applicants on sea duty may apply provided they 
submit an education plan that shows the ability to complete the degree 
program as specified above.

5.  Applications are to be prepared using the format located at the Navy 
College website and must include endorsements by both the commanding officer 
and command master chief (maximum length one page each).  Additional 
information and examples of Navy-relevant areas of study are located at
http://www.navycollege.navy.mil/aev/aev_app.html.

6.  Application packages, with endorsements, must reach Naval Education and 
Training Command, (NETC) Code N523, no later than 27 May 2016.

7.  The point of contact for this matter is ETCM Richard Simpson, NETC N523, 
at (850)452-7268/DSN 459, or via e-mail at richard.l.simpson(at)navy.mil.

8.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or 31 December 2016, 
whichever occurs first.
