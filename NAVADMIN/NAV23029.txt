RMKS/1.  For almost 119 years, NMCRS has helped Sailors and Marines in 
hard times.  The campaign theme, "By Our Own, For Our Own," embodies our 
shared commitment to take care of our Shipmates and fellow Marines. 
This year, the 2023 Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society (NMCRS) Active Duty 
Fund Drive (ADFD) will be conducted from 1 March to 30 April 2023. 
 
2.  The confidential financial assistance NMCRS provides to our Sailors 
and Marines gives peace of mind when a financial crisis exceeds their 
financial ability and keeps them mission ready.  Your contributions 
support interest-free loans and grants for Shipmates and Marines facing 
financial challenges, including those dealing with basic living expense 
issues and family emergencies.  In 2022, NMCRS saw an extraordinary 
increase in the need for support, providing approximately 40,000 Sea 
Service members with more than $42 million in relief.  The Society does 
not receive government funding; it relies on the support of Active Duty and 
retired Sailors and Marines, and other benefactors. 
 
3.  The budget counseling and financial education provided by NMCRS 
volunteers allows our Navy and Marine Corps families to be better prepared 
to address the financial responsibility of adding a new family member or 
being prepared for emergencies. 
 
4.  The roadmap to success requires engaged leadership and management 
at all levels.  Early assignment of motivated fund drive coordinators 
and key people will ensure we have sufficient time to reach 100 percent 
of our Sailors and Marines.  Staying engaged throughout the drive is 
imperative to meeting the goal of 100 percent meaningful contact. 
Leadership must ensure that our Sailors and Marines have the opportunity 
to learn about the critically important programs and services provided by 
NMCRS and offered the opportunity to donate. 
 
5.  During the NMCRS ADFD, Sailors and Marines are authorized to endorse, 
support and participate in fundraising events, but commands and organizations 
must uphold the Department of the Navy's policy of truly voluntary giving. 
    a.  Commands and organizations are reminded to review the regulations 
governing fundraising for NMCRS to determine which activities are permissible 
during the fund drive.  Authorized ADFD fundraising activities in support of 
NMCRS include, but are not limited to command-sponsored raffles, lotteries, 
bake sales, car washes, or bowling tournaments.  Fundraising events must be 
conducted on Department of Defense owned or leased property; otherwise, the 
event loses its "By Our Own, For Our Own" designation and cannot be 
command-endorsed.  Commands and organizations are also strongly encouraged to 
communicate the benefits of NMCRS and its programs and achieving 100 percent 
meaningful contact through speeches, meetings, and videos, both in person and 
shared on social media.  Limited appropriated fund support is permissible for 
kick-off events, award ceremonies, and other non-solicitation events to build 
support and awareness. 
    b.  References (a) through (c) prohibit any coercive activities counter 
to the policy of truly voluntary giving, such as setting unit-level dollar 
goals or participation goals.  Any action, or perceived action, that does not 
allow Service Members to have free choice to give or not to give, or any 
action, or perceived action that Service Members do not have a free choice to 
keep their gifts confidential is prohibited.  The following fundraising 
activities are prohibited: selling civilian clothes privileges or special 
liberty, raffling government parking spaces, sponsoring casino-like games of 
chance, soliciting civilian or contractor personnel, or soliciting outside of 
the federal workplace.  Civilian or contractor personnel are allowed to 
support the ADFD through online donations and participation in fundraisers, 
but may not be solicited to do so. 
    c.  Coordinators for the NMCRS ADFD should consult their JAG or ethics 
counselor for further guidance with regard to specific questions. 
 
6.  I am confident that with the active support and engagement of our 
leadership during the ADFD, NMCRS will remain positioned to continue the 
critical work of helping our Sailors, Marines and their families. 
There are numerous ways to make a contribution through either payroll 
allotment, online credit card, or cash to help our brothers and sisters in 
need.  We should take full advantage of this annual opportunity to help our 
Shipmates and fellow Marines through the 2023 ADFD campaign.
