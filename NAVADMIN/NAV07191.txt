SUBJ/PCS TRANSFER ROLLBACK//
RMKS/1. IN FY-09 (1 OCT 08), A NEW PCS OBLIGATION POLICY WILL TAKE 
EFFECT IN WHICH FUNDING ON ORDERS WILL BE OBLIGATED WHEN THE ORDERS ARE 
RELEASED FROM NAVPERSCOM VICE THE MONTH OF ACTUAL ORDER EXECUTION. 
BECAUSE NAVY CURRENTLY BEGINS WRITING ORDERS IN APRIL FOR THE NEXT 
FISCAL YEAR, THIS POLICY CHANGE WILL RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME 
BILL WHEN IT BECOMES EFFECTIVE.  TO HELP SPREAD THIS COST OVER THE NEXT 
TWO YEARS, FY-07 PCS FUNDING HAS BEEN INCREASED IN AN EFFORT TO ROLL 
BACK AS MANY FY-08 ORDERS TO FY-07 AS POSSIBLE.
2.  WHERE FEASIBLE, AND WITH MINIMAL IMPACT TO SAILORS AND COMMANDS, WE 
WILL MOVE PCS TRANSFERS ORIGINALLY PLANNED FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FY-
08 (OCT, NOV, DEC 2007) TO FY-07 FOR EXECUTION (TRANSFER NOT LATER THAN 
SEP 07).
3.  FOR THOSE SAILORS WHOSE TRANSFER CANNOT BE MOVED TO FY-07, ORDERS 
WILL BE ISSUED TO DETACH IN FY-07, WITH AN "I-STOP"
(INTERMEDIATE STOP) IN ACCOUNT CATEGORY CODE 350 AT THE SAME COMMAND/ 
UIC UNTIL THE SERVICE MEMBER'S ORIGINALLY PLANNED TRANSFER. ALTHOUGH 
THE SERVICE MEMBER WILL REMAIN ON STATION UNTIL HIS/HER ORIGINAL PRD, 
THIS WILL PROVIDE NAVY WITH THE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO ACCOMPLISH 
SOME OF THE COST REDUCTIONS WE ARE LOOKING FOR IN FY09.
4.  THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS RULES WILL APPLY TO THE USE OF A PERSONNEL 
ACCOUNTING I-STOP:
    A.  I-STOPS WILL NOT EXCEED 179 CONSECUTIVE DAYS.
    B.  I-STOP TRANSFERS WILL ONLY OCCUR FROM ACC 100/342 TO
        ACC 350.
    C.  NO I-STOP TRANSFER WILL BE MADE WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY
        AFFECT A SAILOR S PAY OR ENTITLEMENTS.  FOR EXAMPLE,
        NO I-STOP TRANSFER WILL BE ALLOWED FROM ARDUOUS SEA DUTY
        OR EMBARKED UNITS/ STAFF (I.E., RECEIVING SEA PAY) OR
        FROM AN OVERSEAS DUTY STATION.
    D.  THE ACC 350 I-STOP WILL TERMINATE AT THE START OF ANY
        TRAINING TRACK.  THE SERVICE MEMBER MUST PERMANENTLY
        DETACH FROM THE ORIGINAL DUTY STATION TO BEGIN TRAINING.
5.  PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS/FITNESS REPORTS.  EXECUTION OF I-STOP 
ORDERS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MUST NOT GENERATE A DETACHING EVAL OR 
FITREP PER BUPERSINST 1610.10A, CHAPTER 3, PARAGRAPH 3-6.A, SINCE THE 
REPORTING SENIOR WILL NOT CHANGE.  THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WILL BE 
INCLUDED IN ALL PCS ORDERS CONTAINING A PERSONNEL ACCOUNTING I-STOP: 
"THIS MODIFICATION OF ORDERS WILL CHANGE THE SERVICE MEMBER S ACCOUNT 
CATEGORY CODE FROM ACC 100/342 TO ACC 350 AT THE SAME UIC.  PER 
BUPERSINST 1610.10A, CHAPTER 3 PARA 3-6A, DO NOT ISSUE DETACHING 
FITREPS/EVALS UNTIL THE MEMBER ACTUALLY DEPARTS FROM THE ASSIGNED UIC. 
COMPLETE ALL REQUIRED PERIODIC FITREPS/EVALS THAT FALL INTO THIS PERIOD.  
THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE IS IF THE REPORTING SENIOR CHANGES 
(BUPERSINST 1610.10A, CHAPTER 3, PARA 3-6A REFERS).
MULTIPLE FITREPS/EVALS FOR THESE PERIODS THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH 
BUPERSINST 1610.10A WILL BE RETURNED TO THE COMMAND FOR CORRECTION.
6.  I AM FULLY AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THIS PROCESS MAY HAVE ON 
EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY INDIVIDUAL SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES.
OF ALL THE OPTIONS CONSIDERED TO MEET THIS FISCAL CHALLENGE, THIS 
PROCESS IS THE BEST OPTION AND MINIMIZES THE IMPACT TO THE FLEET.
PLEASE KNOW THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AND EFFORTS TO MEET THIS 
AND OTHER CHALLENGES WE FACE AS WE SHAPE OUR NAVY.
