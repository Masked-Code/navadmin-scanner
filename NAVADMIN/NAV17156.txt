RMKS/1.  During the past two years the Navy has undergone audits of its 
financial statements.  The Independent Public Accountant (IPA) concluded that 
the controls over travel are not operating effectively.  As per references 
(a) through (c), the IPA identified three specific areas of non-compliance 
including:
    a.  Travel vouchers not being submitted within five working days of the 
travel return date.
    b.  Defense Travel System (DTS) travel orders were not approved prior to 
the trip start date.
    c.  Delegation of Authority (DOA)/DD577 was missing or incomplete.
    d.  The IPA noted that given the large volume of travel, material 
misstatements may occur on the financial statements and not be detected and 
corrected.  Non-compliance with prevailing travel policy is a significant 
impediment to the Navy achieving an audit opinion.  To measure Navy progress 
towards defined goals, the Navy DTS Program Management Office (PMO) 
instituted a series of metrics that provide Budget Submitting Offices (BSO) 
travel volume reporting and results of corrective action performance 
assessments.  Metrics are posted at the Uniform Resource Locator (url):
https://my.navsup.navy.mil/webcenter/portal/ccpmd_dts
    e.  You are to use these metrics to track your command's progress and 
impact on the Navy's performance towards remediating the notifications of 
finding and recommendation.

2.  With regard to voucher submission within five working days (references 
(d) through (f)), reporting commands and their personnel are directed to take 
the following actions:
    a.  Develop and implement a strategy to ensure ongoing traveler awareness 
of this five working day requirement.
    b.  Ensure all travelers listed on the weekly Navy DTS PMO provided 
'return traveler list' are notified of the five working day voucher 
submission requirement.
    c.  Reference (g) was updated mandating that no travel mission is 
complete until a proper travel claim/voucher is submitted by the traveler.  
If a traveler is submitting a DD form 1351-2 to an authorized Non-DTS Entry 
Agent (NDEA) to sign a voucher on behalf of a traveler by applying a 'T-
entered' stamp in DTS, this form must be signed and dated by the traveler.  
In addition, the submission date of the form by the traveler must be:
        (1) Stamped/written legibly on the form in an available space between 
items 20.c. and 23 and include the printed first and last name of the 
individual who received the form.
        (2) Indicated on supporting documentation attached to the form.  If 
supporting documentation is submitted, it must include the first and last 
name of the traveler, the date of submission of the form by the traveler, the 
DTS Travel Authorization Number (TANUM), the individual's first and last 
name/name of entity receiving the form (e.g., email inbox name), and that it 
is for a travel claim/voucher submission.  The NDEA must then upload the form 
and all required supporting documentation into DTS substantiating records.  
When an authorized NDEA applies the 'T-entered' stamp on behalf of a 
traveler; the traveler is still responsible for the voucher.
    d.  Reference (h) established an escalation protocol for unsubmitted 
vouchers after specified time frames that are listed on the Navy DTS PMO 
provided 'unsubmitted voucher report'.

3.  With regard to travel orders approved after start date of trip, 
(reference (i)) commands must take the following actions:  travel 
authorizations initially approved in DTS after the travel start date must 
include either a justification statement, or email, for the record explaining 
this circumstance and uploaded into the substantiating records; or the 
approving official (AO) enters information into the "remarks" section in the 
digital signature block when they apply the approved stamp.  Whichever method 
is used, the documentation must include:

    a.  The circumstances that prevented pre-trip approval.
    b.  The trip start date.
    c.  The time/date of oral/verbal approval.
    d.  The full name of the official issuing approval.

4.  With regard to incomplete or missing documentation, commands are to 
establish and maintain a centralized repository of all BSO DTS AO DOAS/DD 
form 577s and Certifying Officers Legislation (COL) training certificates 
(reference (j)).  In addition, create and maintain an annual process to 
validate that DTS AOs have completed required COL annual training, and 
participate in Navy DTS PMO AO inspections on BSO ability to provide DTS AO 
documentation.
    a.  Per references (k) and (l), Navy DTS AOs will use a standard DTS 
voucher approval checklist.
    b.  References (a) through (d) and references (g) through (l) are 
available at the  Naval Supply System Command (NAVSUP) consolidated card 
program management division DTS website at:
https://my.navsup.navy.mil/webcenter/portal/ccpmd_dts.

5.  The Navy DTS PMO will be performing spot checks to monitor performance 
and operating effectiveness of reference (d) and references (i) through (k) 
and communicating results and deficiencies to Navy BSOS.  Navy BSOs must 
review their results and take actions as appropriate to correct identified 
deficiencies and report back to Navy DTS PMO in the time frame and format 
specified.
