SUBJ/ADVANCEMENT POLICY UPDATE//

REF/A/DOC/BUPERS/02NOV07//
NARR/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1430.16F, ADVANCEMENT MANUAL FOR ENLISTED PERSONNEL 
OF THE U.S. NAVY AND U.S. NAVY RESERVE.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES CHANGES TO ENLISTED ADVANCEMENT POLICIES 
INTENDED TO REWARD SUSTAINED SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE AND INCREASE THE ROLE OF 
THE COMMAND TRIAD (COMMANDING OFFICER (CO)/EXECUTIVE OFFICER (XO)/COMMAND 
MASTER CHIEF (CMC)) IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF OUR SAILORS.  CHANGES INCLUDE 
UPDATES TO THE FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE (FMS) AND THE COMMAND ADVANCEMENT PROGRAM 
(CAP).

2.  FMS UPDATES AND TIMELINE.  IN ALIGNMENT WITH OUR PERFORMANCE BASED 
INITIATIVE, THE FOLLOWING CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE FMS AND WILL BE 
EFFECTIVE FOR THE AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER 2014 ACTIVE DUTY AND RESERVE NAVY-WIDE 
ADVANCEMENT EXAM (NWAE) CYCLES.  ANY SAILOR WHO IS COMPETING FOR ADVANCEMENT 
IN A PAST MISSED CYCLE WILL BE SCORED WITH THE FMS USED DURING THE MISSED 
CYCLE (FOR EXAMPLE, SAILORS WHO WERE UNABLE TO TAKE AN EARLIER EXAM DUE TO 
INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE (IA) STATUS OR WHO MISS EXAMS THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR 
OWN AND FILE A PETITION THROUGH THE BOARD FOR CORRECTION OF NAVAL RECORDS 
(BCNR)).
    A.  STANDARD SCORE (SS) AND PERFORMANCE MARK AVERAGE (PMA).  TO ACCOUNT 
FOR MEASURING PERFORMANCE DIFFERENTLY AT DIFFERENT PAYGRADES, SS AND PMA 
POINTS AND PERCENTAGES WILL BE ADJUSTED.
THESE CHANGES EMPHASIZE TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE AS MEASURED BY EXAM SCORES FOR 
JUNIOR PAYGRADES AND EMPHASIZE THE CO'S ASSESSMENT OF THE SAILOR'S 
PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY EVALUATIONS FOR SENIOR PAYGRADES.
    B.   AWARDS.  WHILE THE GOOD CONDUCT MEDAL AND NAVY RESERVE
MERITORIOUS SERVICE MEDAL ARE VALUED, THEY WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED IN THE 
AWARD POINT CALCULATION AS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN USEFUL AS DISCRIMINATORS.  
COMMANDS WILL CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE TOP PERFORMANCE OF SAILORS AND POINTS 
WILL CONTINUE TO BE AWARDED FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS SUCH AS THE 
FLAG LETTER OF COMMENDATION, NAVY AND MARINE CORPS ACHIEVEMENT MEDAL, AND 
NAVY AND MARINE CORPS COMMENDATION MEDAL.
    C.  SERVICE IN PAYGRADE (SIPG).  TO EMPHASIZE PERFORMANCE OVER LONGEVITY, 
SIPG POINTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED IN WEIGHT.
    D.  PASSED NOT ADVANCED (PNA).  TO EMPHASIZE CURRENT RATING KNOWLEDGE 
OVER PAST EXAM PERFORMANCE AND TO REWARD TOP PERFORMANCE, PNA POINTS WILL 
ONLY BE AWARDED TO SAILORS RANKED IN THE TOP 25 PERCENT OF PMA AND SS AMONG 
ALL ELIGIBLE CANDIDATES COMPETING FOR ADVANCEMENT.
