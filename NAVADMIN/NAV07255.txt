SUBJ/RETENTION - STAY NAVY CAMPAIGN// 
RMKS/1.  THIS IS THE FOURTH IN A RECURRING SERIES OF MESSAGES DESIGNED 
TO ENCOURAGE OUR SAILORS TO STAY NAVY.  THE FOCUS OF THIS MESSAGE IS 
THE NAVY RESERVE, AND HOW TRANSITION TO THE NAVY RESERVE SUPPORTS THE 
CONCEPT OF SAILOR FOR LIFE.
2.  RECENT COMBAT OPERATIONS HAVE PROVEN THE NAVY*S RESERVE COMPONENT 
IS VITAL TO OUR MAJOR COMBAT OPERATIONS CAPABILITY AND SURGE CAPACITY, 
AND TO MEETING ROUTINE MISSION REQUIREMENTS.  AS SUCH, RETAINING NAVY 
TALENT THROUGH A CONTINUUM OF SERVICE IS A STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE.
SAILOR FOR LIFE IS WHERE I WANT TO GET US:  A CULTURE WHICH VALUES THE 
CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR SAILORS AND CIVILIANS IN EVERY COMPONENT OF OUR 
FORCE, AND PROVIDES CAREER PORTABILITY AND SEAMLESS TRANSITIONS BETWEEN 
THOSE COMPONENTS.  NAVY RESERVE AFFILIATION ALLOWS SAILORS TO REMAIN A 
PART OF THE NAVY FAMILY, CONTINUE THEIR TRAINING AND CAREER, EARN 
RETIREMENT, AND CONTINUE SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY, WHILE PURSUING 
CIVILIAN OPPORTUNITIES -- IN SHORT, TO REMAIN SAILORS FOR LIFE.
3.  TO DESCRIBE THE RESERVE PERSONNEL BATTLESPACE, LESS THAN 12 PERCENT 
OF ENLISTED AND 23 PERCENT OF OFFICERS WHO TRANSITIONED FROM ACTIVE 
DUTY IN FY07 AFFILIATED IN THE NAVY RESERVE.  AS OUTLINED IN OPNAVINST 
1040.11B, COMMANDING OFFICERS, COMMAND MASTER CHIEFS, COMMAND CAREER 
COUNSELORS (CCC*S) AND THE REST OF THE RETENTION TEAM ARE ALL KEY TO 
ENSURING OUR SAILORS ARE WELL-INFORMED REGARDING NAVY RESERVE CAREER 
OPPORTUNITIES, PROGRAMS AND BENEFITS.  COMMANDING OFFICERS MUST SET THE 
TONE WITH THEIR WARDROOMS THROUGH REGULAR DISCUSSIONS, TO BOTH 
ENCOURAGE THEIR OFFICERS TO REMAIN SAILORS FOR LIFE, AND TO PROVIDE THE 
WARDROOM LEADERSHIP THE TOOLS TO MENTOR THEIR SAILORS.  COMMANDING 
OFFICERS CAN OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF CONTINUED 
SERVICE IN THE NAVY RESERVE AT WWW.NAVYRESERVE.COM, AND CAN FIND A NAVY 
RESERVE AFFILIATION QUICK GUIDE AT:  
WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/CAREERINFO/STAYNAVYTOOLS/NAVYRESERVE.HTM.
CCC*S RECEIVE TRAINING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT NAVY RESERVE 
PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS, MONTGOMERY GI BILL-SELECTED RESERVE 
BENEFITS, TRICARE RESERVE SELECT BENEFITS, AND EMPLOYER SUPPORT OF THE 
GUARD AND RESERVE.  A NAVY RESERVE FUNDAMENTALS COURSE IS AVAILABLE ON 
NAVY KNOWLEDGE ONLINE (NKO).  SAILORS WHO AFFILIATE WITH THE NAVY 
RESERVE WITHIN 180 DAYS OF THEIR END OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE ARE 
CREDITED TOWARD THEIR ACTIVE DUTY COMMAND*S REENLISTMENT RATE.
4.  THE MOBILIZATION DEFERMENT POLICY (NAVADMIN 007/07) WAS ESTABLISHED 
TO GUARANTEE SAILORS WHO AFFILIATE TO RESERVE STATUS UPON TRANSITION 
FROM ACTIVE DUTY AMPLE TIME TO ESTABLISH THEIR CIVILIAN LIVES.  ALL 
NAVY VETERAN (NAVET) AND OTHER SERVICE VETERAN
(OSVET) PERSONNEL WHO AFFILIATE WITH THE NAVY RESERVE WITHIN SIX MONTHS 
(183 DAYS) OF RELEASE FROM ACTIVE DUTY QUALIFY FOR A TWO-YEAR DEFERMENT 
FROM INVOLUNTARY MOBILIZATION, COMMENCING ON THE DATE THEY AFFILIATE 
WITH THE NAVY RESERVE.  ALL PERSONNEL WHO AFFILIATE BETWEEN SEVEN AND 
12 MONTHS (184 - 365 DAYS) AFTER RELEASE QUALIFY FOR A ONE-YEAR 
DEFERMENT FROM INVOLUNTARY MOBILIZATION, COMMENCING ON THE DATE THEY 
AFFILIATE WITH THE NAVY RESERVE.  ADDITIONALLY, SAILORS IN SELECTED 
RATINGS OR DESIGNATORS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR BONUSES FOR AFFILIATING WITH 
THE NAVY RESERVE.  MORE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN NAVADMINS 065/07 
AND 079/07.
5.  FLEET TO NAVY OPERATIONAL SUPPORT CENTER (NOSC) IS A PILOT PROGRAM 
CREATED BY COMMANDER, NAVY RECRUITING COMMAND (CNRC) TO STREAMLINE THE 
NAVY RESERVE AFFILIATION PROCESS.  FLEET TO NOSC BEGAN 1 NOVEMBER 2006, 
AND HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL FOR THE 15 COMMANDS PARTICIPATING IN 
THE PROGRAM.  USS HARRY S. TRUMAN (CVN 75), USS RONALD REAGAN (CVN 76), 
USS PEARL HARBOR (LSD 52), USS TARAWA (LHA 1), USS NASSAU (LHA 4), USS 
JEFFERSON CITY (SSN 759), NAVAL MOBILE CONSTRUCTION BATTALION SEVEN, 
BRANCH MEDICAL CLINIC SEWELLS POINT, CARRIER AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING 
SQUADRON 124 (VAW-124), AND HELICOPTER ANTI-SUBMARINE SQUADRON LIGHT 43 
(HSL-43) HAVE BEEN RECENTLY JOINED BY FIVE INFORMATION WARFARE UNITS:  
NAVY INFORMATION OPERATIONS COMMAND (NIOC) FORT MEADE, MARYLAND, NIOC 
FORT GORDON, GEORGIA, NIOC SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, NIOC AURORA, COLORADO 
AND NIOC SCHOFIELD BARRACKS, HAWAII.  COMMANDS PARTICIPATING IN FLEET 
TO NOSC HAVE AN AFFILIATION RATE OF 28 PERCENT, COMPARED TO THE ALL 
NAVY RATE OF 12 PERCENT.  EXPANSION OF FLEET TO NOSC WITH A WEB-BASED 
SOLUTION IS EXPECTED IN FY09 (BELOW); IN THE MEANTIME, CCC*S CAN OBTAIN 
INFO AT WWW.NAVYRESERVE.COM AND A NAVY RESERVE AFFILIATION QUICK-GUIDE
AT: WWW.NAVY.MIL/CAREERINFO/STAYNAVYTOOLS/NAVYRESERVE.HTM.  CNRC POC*S 
FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT FLEET TO NOSC ARE NCCM BRUCE MCCARLEY AT 
(901) 874-9146, AT1(AW) RANDY WATSON AT (901) 874-9096, OR ENC(SW) 
JULIEN BOYLAND AT (901) 874-9082/DSN 882.
6.  RESERVE AFFILIATION TOOL:  BEGINNING IN FY09, CAREER MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM-INTERACTIVE DETAILING (CMS/ID) WILL ALLOW ACTIVE DUTY CCC*S TO 
VIEW VACANT NAVY RESERVE ENLISTED BILLETS BEFORE SAILORS LEAVE ACTIVE 
DUTY.  THIS CAPABILITY WILL PROVIDE SAILORS INSIGHT INTO RESERVE UNITS 
AND BILLETS IN THE LOCATION WHERE THEY PLAN TO LIVE.
THE GOAL OF SAILORS APPLYING FOR ORDERS THEMSELVES VIA CMS/ID CAN ONLY 
BE ACCOMPLISHED IF ALL SAILORS ARE EDUCATED ABOUT THEIR OWN CAREER 
PROGRESSION AND THE BENEFITS OF THE NAVY RESERVE.  THIS IS JUST ONE 
EXAMPLE OF HOW AN EFFECTIVE CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM CAN BE AN 
EXTREMELY VALUABLE INVESTMENT IN OUR SAILORS, AND OFFER A FANTASTIC 
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO STAY NAVY FOR LIFE.
7.  RETAINING QUALITY, TRAINED PERSONNEL IS AN INTEGRAL ELEMENT OF 
SHAPING NAVY*S TOTAL WORKFORCE TO MEET CURRENT AND FUTURE WARFIGHTING 
REQUIREMENTS.  THE ARGUS SURVEY HAS PROVEN AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO GATHER 
INFORMATION ON THOSE INFLUENCES WHICH EFFECT RETENTION BEHAVIOR.  THE 
SURVEY PROVIDES NAVY LEADERSHIP WITH DIRECT INPUT TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF 
SERVICE AND SUPPORT COMPENSATION, PERSONNEL, AND POLICY DECISIONS.  
COMMANDING OFFICERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO HAVE THEIR SAILORS PARTICIPATE IN 
THE ARGUS CAREER MILESTONE TRACKING SYSTEM AT THE KEY CAREER MILESTONE 
TRANSITION POINTS DEFINED IN OPNAVINST 1040.10A.  THE ARGUS SURVEY CAN 
BE FOUND ON THE BUPERS ONLINE WEB-PORTAL.  NUMEROUS SURVEY MECHANISMS 
REVEAL ONE OF THE TOP REASONS WHY SAILORS STAY NAVY IS FOR MEDICAL 
BENEFITS.  THIS BENEFIT IS BEING EXTENDED TO THE NAVY RESERVE.  
BEGINNING 1 OCTOBER 2007, RESERVISTS WILL BE ABLE TO ENROLL IN AN 
IMPROVED TRICARE SERVICE.
THIS NEW PROGRAM INCLUDES COVERAGE FOR THE RESERVIST AND FAMILY MEMBERS 
FOR COSTS WELL BELOW WHAT IS OFFERED BY CIVILIAN INSURERS.
MORE INFORMATION ON THIS AND OTHER BENEFITS OF RESERVE AFFILIATION ARE 
AVAILABLE AT WWW.NAVYRESERVE.COM.
8.  BEST PRACTICES:  THE CAREER INFORMATION TEAM ABOARD USS TARAWA 
BRIEFS ALL PERSONNEL WHO ARE WITHIN 15 MONTHS OF THEIR EXPIRATION OF 
ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE (EAOS) ON THEIR CAREER OPTIONS AND THEIR 
OPPPORTUNITIES IN THE NAVY RESERVE, SHOULD THEY DECIDE TO LEAVE ACTIVE 
DUTY.  RESERVE AFFILIATION IS AN IMPORTANT AND CONTINUAL PART OF CAREER 
EDUCATION, AND IS DISCUSSED DURING THE FIRST TERM SUCCESS WORKSHOP, THE 
CAREER DEVELOPMENT TRAINING COURSE, AND ONBOARD CAREER DEVELOPMENT TEAM 
TRAINING.  USS TARAWA SAILORS ARE ALSO COUNSELED ON THEIR OPPORTUNITY 
TO JOIN THE NAVY RESERVE WHILE ON ACTIVE DUTY DURING THEIR PRE-
SEPARATION BRIEF, GIVEN BEFORE ATTENDING TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
(TAP) TRAINING.  THEY ARE BRIEFED ONCE AGAIN DURING THE CHECKOUT 
PROCESS TO REITERATE THAT SAILORS CAN CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THEIR NAVY 
BENEFITS IF THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO THEM 
IN THE NAVY RESERVE.  EDUCATION REGARDING THE NAVY RESERVE HAS BEEN THE 
FOUNDATION OF USS TARAWA'S SUCCESS IN THE FLEET TO NOSC PILOT PROGRAM.  
LEADERS ONBOARD USS HARRY S. TRUMAN ALSO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF 
EDUCATING SAILORS ABOUT RESERVE AFFILIATION.  DURING INDOCTRINATION, 
SAILORS LEARN ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF THE NAVY RESERVE AND THE BENEFITS OF 
AFFILIATION.  THEY ALSO COVER THE INDIVIDUAL READY RESERVE (IRR) 
REQUIREMENTS FOR FIRST-TERM SAILORS.  USS HARRY S. TRUMAN HOLDS A 
MONTHLY PERFORM-TO-SERVE (PTS) CONGRATULATORY MEETING BY THE COMMANDING 
OFFICER, FOR THE SAILORS APPROVED TO STAY NAVY.  DURING THIS MEETING, 
RESERVE AFFILIATION IS DISCUSSED AS AN OPTION FOR MEMBERS WHO DECIDE TO 
LEAVE ACTIVE DUTY AT THE END OF THEIR EAOS.
