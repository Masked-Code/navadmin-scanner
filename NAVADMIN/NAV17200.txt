RMKS/1.  In an effort to reduce administrative distractions and grant 
commanding officers (CO) more authority, this NAVADMIN amends reference (a) 
and announces that COs may reinstate Sailors to E4 who were previously 
reduced in rank to E3.  This new authority is an outcome of the Enlisted 
Advancement Working Group that is supporting Rating Modernization and Sailor 
2025 initiatives.  This NAVADMIN also eliminates advancement exams for 
Sailors in accelerated advancement ratings or Sailors who convert to one of 
these ratings. These policy changes are effective 1 December 2017.

2.  Reference (a) is amended to expand CO authority to reinstate ranks up to 
E4.  Sailors reduced in rank from E4 to E3 by non-judicial punishment, for 
minor offenses as outlined in Article 15 of reference (b), must wait a 
minimum of 6 months before becoming eligible for reinstatement to E4.  
Reinstatement to E4 is at the discretion of the current CO, of the member, 
and does not automatically occur after the 6 month waiting period.  COs may 
choose to delay reinstatement until they deem the Sailor is ready for the 
additional responsibility.  There is no obligation for a Sailor to ultimately 
be advanced if the CO does not feel it is warranted.  Sailors may petition 
the Immediate Superior in Command of the unit after 12 months from the date 
of reduction to E3 if CO has not granted restoration.  Administrative Remarks 
(NAVPERS 1070/613) (permanent) must be completed by the command of the member 
and sent to Navy Personnel Command, Enlisted Career Administration/Enlisted 
Boards Division (PERS-81).  NAVPERS 1070/613 (CO signature required) must 
include the following language:

(date): _______ Effective this date, Service Member has been reinstated to 
E4.  Effective date of paygrade is _______ and time-in-rate date is ______.
    a.  The effective date of paygrade will be the reinstatement date 
approved by the CO.
    b.  The time-in-rate date will be applied as outlined in reference (c).
    c.  The required Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System transaction 
must be completed to ensure proper reinstatement of the effected member.

3.  The following 20 ratings from the Advanced Electronics Field, Advanced 
Technical Field, and Nuclear Field Programs, as outlined in reference (d), 
are considered accelerated advancement ratings and the associated E4 
advancement exam for each is eliminated:  AWF, AWO, AWR, AWS, AWV, CTI, CTN, 
EMN, EOD, ET, ETN, FC, FCA, IS, ITS, MMN, MT, ND, SB, and SO.

4.  References (a) through (d) will be updated to reflect these changes.

5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
