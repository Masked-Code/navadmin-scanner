CONSTRUCTIONMAN MASTER CHIEF RATING NAME CHANGE TO SEABEE MASTER CHIEF// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Constructionman Master Chief (CUCM), 
Equipmentman Master Chief (EQCM) and Utilities Constructionman Master Chief 
(UCCM) rating name change to Seabee Master Chief (CBCM).  The rating change 
applies to Active-Duty and Selected Reserve Sailors. 
 
2.  After an extensive review of current Naval Construction Force (NCF) 
Master Chief billets, it was determined that the majority of the billets can 
be filled by any Seabee Master Chief regardless of source rating.  Therefore, 
realigning the CUCM, EQCM and UCCM ratings into a single CBCM rating is a 
natural progression.  This initiative directly supports Sailor 2025 and 
Rating Modernization and will ensure that highly qualified Senior Chiefs will 
no longer be limited on opportunity due to their source rating and future 
CBCMs will be sourced from the best and most fully qualified Senior Chiefs 
across the entire NCF. 
 
3.  Those Master Chiefs currently in the CUCM, EQCM or UCCM ratings will be 
automatically converted to CBCM on 15 March 2021.  Requests for conversion 
from Sailors or commands will not be required.  Current source ratings badges 
will be retained.  Fiscal year 2022 E-9 Selection Board (convening April 2021 
for Reserve Component and June 2021 for Active Component) will be the first 
boards advancing to CBCM. 
 
4.  All existing and future CUCM, EQCM and UCCM personnel will be awarded a 
Navy enlisted classification (NEC) code to identify their source rating. The 
establishment of the three new personnel tracking NEC codes will be proposed 
once the renaming is approved. 
 
5.  The following existing NEC codes, which identify CUCM, EQCM and UCCM as 
potential source ratings, which will be updated to reflect CBCM as the E9 
source rating, are B03A, Bl6A, Bl8A, Bl9A, L39A, L40A, 717B, 718B, 745B and 
757B.
