RMKS/1.  Influenza is a contagious viral respiratory illness, which can cause 
mild to severe illness resulting in hospitalization or death.
Influenza has the potential to adversely impact Navy force readiness and 
mission execution.
2.  Influenza Vaccination and Reporting
    a.  Influenza Disease Prevention.  Vaccination is the primary method to 
reduce risk of influenza by enhancing force immunity.  Maintaining a clean 
work environment, good hygiene practices including cough/sneeze hygiene, and 
managing workforce exposure (e.g., social distancing, teleworking, and sick 
leave) are effective methods to reduce the risk of spreading influenza.
    b.  Influenza Vaccine.  Two influenza vaccines, Northern Hemisphere (NH) 
and Southern Hemisphere (SH) are available based on service member location 
and timing requirements as described in reference (b).  The 2021-2022 
Department of Defense (DoD) influenza season vaccine supply will be comprised 
of injectable vaccines.  Intranasal vaccine will not be provided through the 
central ordering process.
    c.  Influenza Vaccine Priority.  U.S. Navy ships, operational assets, and 
training commands have been identified by the DoD and Department of Navy 
(DON) as vaccine priority groups for the 2021-2022 influenza season.
    d.  Influenza Vaccine Ordering.  The Vaccine Information and Logistics 
System (VIALS) is the online requisition system for seasonal influenza 
vaccine.  VIALS tracks requisitioned vaccine electronically via Military 
Standard Requisitioning and Issuing Procedure (MILSTRIP) from requisition to 
receipt.  Navy influenza vaccine is centrally funded.  The VIALS Web site is 
common access card enabled:
https://gov_only.nmlc.med.navy.mil/int_code03/vials/.
    e.  The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NAVMEDLOGCOM) is responsible for 
ordering and distributing influenza vaccine for all Navy and Marine Corps 
activities.  Additional quantities required must be coordinated with the 
NAVMEDLOGCOM Influenza Vaccine Manager, (240) 308-2779, DSN:
343-8054 or the Vaccine Information and Logistics System (VIALS) helpdesk
at: usn.detrick.navmedlogcomftdmd.list.vialhelp@mail.mil.
    f.  Influenza Vaccine Shipping.  All ordering commands will verify their 
correct shipping address and point of contact information in VIALS to ensure 
prompt delivery.
    g.  Influenza Vaccine Integrity
        (1) Temperature Monitors.  All Influenza vaccine shipments include 
temperature monitors.  All monitors must be returned to the Defense Logistics 
Agency Troop Support Medical (DLA-TSM) cold chain office after receipt per 
the included instructions and shipping materials.
            (a) No Alarm Status.  The vaccine is ready for immediate use.
            (b) Alarmed Status.  Do not administer vaccine.  Segregate the 
vaccine in the refrigerator with a sign saying DO NOT USE, return temperature 
monitor to DLA-TSM, and await disposition.
    h.  Influenza Vaccine Exercise.  Previous influenza seasons have been 
used to exercise and evaluate mass vaccination scenarios.  These coordinated 
mass vaccination campaigns provide rapid and efficient vaccinations to 
protect the maximum number of susceptible persons.  Process improvements are 
made to delivery and reporting procedures based on lessons learned.  Ensure 
masking, social distancing, group size limitations, and other appropriate 
precautions during any mass vaccination exercises, if undertaken.
    i.  Vaccine Delivery.  Due to vaccine demand and manufacturer 
limitations, complete vaccine delivery may not occur until mid-November.  
This delay will unintentionally test the ability to conduct rapid and 
complete mass vaccination exercises.
    j.  Influenza Vaccination Compliance
        (1) Navy Military Personnel.  The seasonal influenza vaccination is 
mandatory for all DoD uniformed personnel who are not medically or 
administratively exempt, per references (a), (b), and (d).  Any refusal to 
receive the influenza vaccine will constitute a failure to obey a lawful 
order and may be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and/or 
result in administrative action.  Prior to receiving the influenza vaccine, 
Navy Active and Reserve Component personnel will have access to healthcare 
providers to address questions or concerns with influenza vaccination.
Commands must consult with the servicing Staff Judge Advocate General for 
additional guidance on influenza vaccination non-compliance.
        (2) Navy Civilian Personnel.  Influenza vaccination is required for 
all civilian healthcare personnel as per reference (b), and is strongly 
encouraged for all other Navy civilian employees.
        (3) TRICARE Beneficiaries.  Reference (c) authorizes retail network 
pharmacies to administer the seasonal influenza vaccine.  TRICARE 
beneficiaries may receive influenza vaccinations with no co-pay at authorized 
retail network pharmacies.  Beneficiaries are encouraged to contact the 
pharmacy regarding age restrictions as some pharmacies do not administer the 
influenza vaccine to individuals younger than 18 years of age.
    k.  Influenza Vaccination Reporting.  Active and Reserve Component Navy 
force vaccination administration compliance will be monitored via the Medical 
Readiness Reporting System (MRRS).  Designated command personnel will access 
MRRS to track their personnel to ensure compliance.
        (1) Shore-based commands will request access to MRRS based on their 
unit identification code by submitting a system access authorization request 
available at: //mrrs.dc3n.navy.mil/mrrs (note:  MRRS Web address is case 
sensitive).  Point of contact:  MRRS program office and e-mail:
mrrspo(at)navy.mil (800) 537-4617 / (504) 697-7070/DSN:  647-7070.  Ship-
based commands may utilize Navy Medicine Online (NMO) or Shipboard Non-
Tactical Automated Data Processing (SNAP) Automated Medical System (SAMS) to 
populate MRRS.
        (2) Commands must ensure that documentation of influenza vaccine 
administration is coded to accurately reflect the type of vaccine given.
        (3) Afloat units will enter influenza immunizations into the 
Shipboard Automated Medical System/Theater Medical Information Program 
Maritime (TMIP-M) for subsequent transfer to MRRS.
        (4) All personnel who receive the vaccination from a retail network 
pharmacy must provide documentation of vaccination no later than the next 
workday for Active Component or within 7 days for Reserve Component to ensure 
compliance is appropriately recorded in their electronic health records and 
MRRS.
        (5) Vaccination Timeline
            (a) Due to the risk of infection transmission within the unit and 
impact on operations, it is imperative that the vaccine be given with minimal 
delay as possible.  Active duty units have 72 hours (three business working 
days) following receipt of the vaccine to administer and document the 
vaccine.  The 72-hour requirement begins immediately only if the temperature 
monitor is in no alarm status upon receipt; if in alarmed status the timed 
requirement begins once/if the vaccine is cleared for use by DLA-TSM.  If the
72 hour requirement cannot be met, unit situation reports will be submitted 
to the respective Immediate Superior in Command and Type Commanders.  
Situation reports are not required if the temperature monitor is in alarmed 
status and the unit is awaiting disposition from DLA-TSM.
            (b) As Reserve Component Command schedules vary, NAVMEDLOGCOM and 
DLA-TSM will coordinate to make every effort for the vaccine to arrive the 
week of a drill weekend.  Units have 30 days following receipt of the vaccine 
to document, administer, and report vaccination if the temperature monitor is 
in a no alarm status.  If in alarmed status, the timed requirement begins 
once/if the vaccine is cleared for use by DLA-TSM.
        (6) Per paragraph 2.i, uniformed member compliance must be tracked in 
MRRS.  If desired, installations and medical treatment facilities (MTF) may 
also use the Navy Family Accountability and Assessment System (NFAAS) to 
conduct a Pandemic Influenza response exercise in conjunction with the 
seasonal influenza vaccine program.
    l.  U.S. Navy Goals and Performance Standards
        (1) To ensure force medical readiness before peak influenza season, 
all Navy operational units and Navy Medical Readiness and Training 
Command/Units
(NMRTC/U) will administer the 2021-2022 influenza vaccination to exceed the 
90 percent vaccination goal by 15 December 2021 for Active and Reserve 
Components.
Complete vaccine access will be provided for all Navy family (includes 
dependents, other beneficiaries, and DON civilians).  Active coordination 
between command leadership, public affairs officers, and medical personnel is 
necessary to achieve success.
        (2) Influenza Vaccination Performance Standards.  The following goals 
will be monitored:
            (a) Navy VIALS reports 100 percent of shipped vaccine received 
onboard by fleet and Navy units by 1 December 2021.
            (b) MRRS reports 90 percent of Active and Reserve Component 
vaccinated by 15 December 2021.  Commands will coordinate with the servicing 
MTF to align command-wide vaccinations with Navy vaccination goals.  Medical 
personnel at servicing MTFs will promptly report vaccinations in MRRS.
    m.  Vaccine administration and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
         (1) There is no current contraindication for administration of the 
influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic and every effort should be 
made to deliver the flu vaccine as quickly as possible to eligible Service 
members.
         (2) If a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is available during the seasonal 
influenza vaccination period, commands will follow instructions from the CDC 
and per reference (f).
