RMKS/1.  IRT REF A, A FLAG/SES PANEL REVIEWED CANDIDATE NOMINATIONS  AND 
SELECTED THE WINNERS THAT MERIT SPECIAL RECOGNITION.  THIS AWARD  RECOGNIZES 
MILITARY AND CIVILIAN LOGISTICIANS WHO EPITOMIZE  EXCELLENCE IN LOGISTICS 
PLANNING AND EXECUTION.  I AM PLEASED TO  ANNOUNCE THE FOLLOWING ADMIRAL STAN 
ARTHUR AWARD WINNERS FOR  CALENDAR YEAR 2011:
    A.  THE MILITARY LOGISTICIAN OF THE YEAR IS LTCOL CHARLES JONES  ASSIGNED 
TO NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND.  AS THE CH-53K ASSISTANT  PROGRAM MANAGER 
LOGISTICS, LTCOL JONES LED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF  CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE 
PLUS (CBM+) THROUGH A COMMON OPERATING  ENVIRONMENT, ENABLING THE PROGRAM 
OFFICE AND KEY SUPPORT ACTIVITIES  TO COLLECT, VALIDATE, ANALYZE, AND 
DISTRIBUTE LOGISTICS DATA FROM A  SINGLE POINT OF REFERENCE USING STANDARDIZED 
METRICS, PROCESSES, AND  PROCEDURES.  BY PROVIDING A COMMON VIEW ACROSS 
STAKEHOLDERS WHILE  CONTINUOUSLY COMPARING WEAPONS SYSTEM PERFORMANCE AGAINST 
PREDICTIVE  ANALYSES, HE TARGETED MORE AFFORDABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVING  
READINESS AND RAPID ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS THAT REVOLUTIONIZED  SUSTAINMENT 
PRACTICES ACROSS MULTIPLE PROGRAMS.
    B.  THE CIVILIAN LOGISTICIAN OF THE YEAR IS MR. MICHAEL ROBINSON,  
ASSIGNED TO MILITARY SEALIFT COMMAND.  AS THE COMBAT LOGISTICS FORCE
 (CLF) LOAD PROGRAM MANAGER, MR. ROBINSON CONCEIVED AND SPEARHEADED  THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED DISTANCE SUPPORT BUSINESS  MODEL THAT 
CENTRALIZED SHIPBOARD BUSINESS PROCESSES ASHORE,  RESULTING IN A NET SAVINGS 
OF $4.5M ANNUALLY.  MR. ROBINSON WAS  INSTRUMENTAL IN ESTABLISHING A WORLDWIDE 
CLF LOGISTICS OFFICER  OPERATIONAL NETWORK EMBEDDED WITHIN THE LOGISTICS TASK 
FORCE  COMMANDS TO EXECUTE THE CLF OPERATIONAL SUSTAINMENT BUSINESS MODEL.
 MR. ROBINSON CENTRALIZED FLEET CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS PROCESSING AT  LOGISTICS 
TASK FORCE COMMANDS AND PROVIDED TOTAL ASSET VISIBILITY OF  CLF INVENTORIES, 
ALLOWING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS TO BE SOURCED FROM  MULTIPLE PLATFORMS AND 
THEREBY DECREASING LOGISTICS RESPONSE TIME  AND ENHANCING MATERIAL READINESS.  
ADDITIONALLY, HE ESTABLISHED A  GLOBAL STOCK CONTROL OFFICE IN NORFOLK 
RESPONSIBLE FOR CENTRALIZING  INVENTORY AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT EXECUTION AND 
OVERSIGHT OF 30 CLF  SHIPS DEPLOYED WORLDWIDE.
    C.  THE OPERATIONAL LOGISTICS TEAM OF THE YEAR IS THE NAVAL AIR  SYSTEMS 
COMMAND OPERATION TOMODACHI TECHNICAL TEAM. FOLLOWING THE  MARCH 2011 
EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN JAPAN AND THE RELEASE OF LARGE  QUANTITIES OF 
AIRBORNE RADIOLOGICAL CONTAMINATION, THIS TEAM  PROVIDED EXCEPTIONAL SUPPORT 
TO NAVAL AVIATION HUMANITARIAN  ASSISTANCE/DISASTER RESPONSE OPERATIONS AND 
RETURNING AVIATION  MATERIAL TO FULL OPERATIONAL STATUS TO SUPPORT WORLDWIDE 
OPERATIONS.
  GIVEN THE SCARCITY AND INCONSISTENCY OF AVAILABLE RADIOLOGICAL  DOCTRINE, 
THE TOMODACHI TECHNICAL TEAM PROVIDED LOGISTICS AND  ENGINEERING DIRECTION TO 
THE FLEET OPERATING IN THE AFFECTED REGION  TO REVISE AND ESTABLISH NEW 
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO PROTECT  AIRCREW AND MAINTAINERS, AS WELL AS 
GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL REPAIR  ACTIVITIES, FROM POTENTIAL RADIOLOGICAL 
CONTAMINATION.  NEARLY 160  AIRCRAFT AND 15,000 COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN SCREENED 
WITHOUT A SINGLE  POTENTIALLY CONTAMINATED ASSET BEING RECEIVED AT A REPAIR 
FACILITY.
 THIS GROUND-BREAKING EFFORT ENABLED NAVAL AVIATION UNITS TO COMPLETE  BOTH 
THEIR HUMANITARIAN MISSION IN SUPPORT OF THE JAPANESE PEOPLE  AND ALSO 
COMPLETE SUBSEQUENT NATIONAL TASKINGS AROUND THE WORLD.
    D.  THE JOINT LOGISTICS TEAM OF THE YEAR IS THE NAVAL MEDICAL  LOGISTICS 
COMMAND TEAM, FORT DETRICK, MD.  THIS TEAM SUCCESSFULLY  ACQUIRED AND DEPLOYED 
THREE MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) SYSTEMS  TO THE ACTIVE COMBAT ZONE IN 
AFGHANISTAN. THE UNPRECEDENTED AIRLIFT  OF THESE SYSTEMS AND THE MITIGATION OF 
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES POSED  BY THE AUSTERE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT WERE THE 
RESULT OF EXPERT  PLANNING, COORDINATION, AND EXECUTION.  THE TEAM'S VISIONARY  
APPROACH ACHIEVED FULL OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY WITHIN ONLY SEVEN  MONTHS OF 
RECEIVING THE REQUIREMENT.  ESTABLISHING MRI CAPABILITIES  IN A COMBAT THEATER 
WAS A LEAP FORWARD IN BATTLEFIELD MEDICAL  CAPABILITIES WITH GREAT POTENTIAL 
TO IMPROVE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT  OF MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES.

2.  AWARD LEVELS ARE $5,000 EACH FOR THE MILITARY AND THE CIVILIAN  
LOGISTICIAN OF THE YEAR AND $10,000 EACH FOR THE TEAM AWARDS.  THE  TEAM
