1.  This message announces changes to distribution policies for Active 
Component (AC) and Full Time Support (FTS) senior enlisted personnel (E7-E9).  
Effective immediately, these changes amplify previous guidance on early 
return to sea outlined in reference (a).

2.  We operate in a dynamic environment and Sailors are our key advantage.  
Assigning Chiefs to our ships, submarines, squadrons, and other key 
operational and Fleet production units is vital to maintaining that 
advantage.  With this in mind, sea shore flow and sea shore rotation in 
references (b) and (c) will be updated.  Until then, all Chiefs (E7-E9) can 
expect assignment as set forth in this NAVADMIN.

3.  Assignments for all enlisted supervisors, including those selected for 
advancement to Chief, will be reviewed and managed to maximize Fleet manning 
readiness.  When detailing Chiefs, sea shore flow and sea shore rotation 
concerns will continue to be considered, but will be secondary to Fleet 
manning requirements.  Additional factors that will be considered include 
recent deployment dates and dwell time, career progression, manning posture 
and Critical Navy Enlisted Classification Codes (CNECs) at both the current 
and projected commands.

4.  Newly selected Chiefs should expect assignment to sea and operational 
billets as the new norm.  Additionally, all Chiefs (E7-E9) may be considered 
for reassignment based on the following business rules:
    a.  Chiefs assigned to unfunded billets in line with reference
(d),
    b.  Chiefs assigned to an activity in excess of supervisor Billets 
Authorized (BA), and
    c.  Chiefs assigned to a BA requirement of a lower paygrade. Waivers may 
be granted on a case basis to support Fleet readiness requirements.

5.  Chiefs in an assignment that fits one of the above business rules are 
encouraged to consider the Voluntary Sea Duty Program, reference (e), and the 
Sea Duty Incentive Pay Program, reference (f).  Proactive action to manage 
career progression comes with potential benefits including geographic 
stability, the opportunity to negotiate for choice orders, and Sea Duty 
Incentive Pay for eligible ratings which can found at
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/career/payandbenefits/Pages/sdip.aspx.

6.  For those identified for redistribution, COMNAVPERSCOM Placement
Management Department (PERS-4013) will contact the command to notify them 
that a Chief was identified for redistribution. Every effort will be made to 
first reassign the Chief within the same TYCOM/BSO, but when that is not 
practical, the Chief will be assigned to the highest priority billet 
requirement of the MCA.  The management and review of nuclear-trained 
supervisor assignments will be closely coordinated between PERS-403 and OPNAV 
N133.

7.  This redistribution policy will lead to a more efficient assignment of 
senior enlisted leadership across the Navy.  For assistance or further 
information, contact the Navy Personnel Customer Service Center at 1(866) U-
Ask-NPC/DSN 882 or via e-mail at uasknpc(at)navy.mil.

8.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.

9.  Released by Vice Admiral R. P. Burke, N1.//
