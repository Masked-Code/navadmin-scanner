RMKS/1. Campaign Drug Free (CDF) is one of six Flagship Programs within the 
Navy Community Service Program.  Sailors and Marines who volunteer have a 
profound impact by promoting drug demand reduction programs to schools, 
organizations, and communities to address youth on the dangers of drug abuse 
and the importance of being drug free. They strengthen their communities 
through education, promoting health and fitness, encouraging alternatives to 
drug use, and promoting anti-drug lifestyles.  Per reference (a), Commander, 
Navy Reserve Force is the Flagship Sponsor for CDF, and each year the Navy 
recognizes the best programs that teach elementary, middle, and high school 
children about the dangers of drug abuse in their communities.  These 
exemplary outreach programs have effectively reduced drug and alcohol abuse 
by children through outreach programs and education. In addition, by 
participating in community service projects, volunteers reinforce the Navy 
Core Values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment as a means to further 
leadership and character development.

3. Throughout the Navy, command and individual participation in CDF benefited

one of you who serve.
