RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN identifies several actions aimed at increasing 
Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) security and security awareness; 
and reinforcement of existing and emerging SCI facility (SCIF) security and 
requirements.  Reference (a) directed several actions, as part of a wide-
ranging security review, to ensure individual and collective accountability 
for Classified National Security Information (CNSI).  Commanders and Heads of 
DON Activities (herein referred to as Commanders) should review reference (a) 
and examine current procedures and readiness to identify adjustments that 
improve Navy's security posture. 
 
2.  Commanders are responsible for overall management, functioning, and 
effectiveness of their SCI Information Security Program (ISP). References are 
provided to assist commands in understanding authorities and responsibilities 
regarding the security of CNSI, Navy Special Security Office (SSO) 
authorities and responsibilities, ISP awareness, Personally Owned Portable 
Electronic Device (P-PED) use in SCIFs, and evolving radio-frequency (RF) 
shielding/TEMPEST Countermeasure requirements. 
 
3.  Per reference (a) through (e), the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare (DCNO N2N6)/Director of Naval Intelligence (DNI)/Navy 
Head Intelligence Community Element (HICE) has overall responsibility for the 
implementation and oversight of the Navy SCI Security Program.  Special 
Security Office, Navy (SSO Navy) is designated the Cognizant Security 
Authority (CSA) for the Department of the Navy (DON) and is responsible for 
the security management, implementation, and oversight of DON's SCI security 
program (Secretariat, Navy, and Marine Corps). 
 
4.  Personnel Security.  As the responsible security authority, Commanders 
must ensure all personnel have a valid and appropriate security clearance, 
have executed an appropriate non-disclosure agreement, and have a valid need 
to know before allowing access to CNSI at any level.  Command implementation 
of "need to know" principles is essential to ensuring the security of 
CNSI.  No individual shall be deemed to have a need to know solely by virtue 
of grade, title, position, or clearance level.  Further, when a person with a 
previously established need to know changes position or status, the 
requirement must be re-validated or access removed. 
    a.  Per reference (a), Commanders are responsible to ensure that all 
cleared Navy personnel are included and accounted for in the Defense 
Information System of Security (DISS) (DoD's designated system for tracking 
personnel clearences) by 31 August 2023. 
    b.  Per reference (a), Commanders, with their Command Security Manager, 
will conduct a comprehensive review of assigned personnel against their 
Security Management Office (SMO) code list contained within DISS, ensuring 
each individual is accounted.  Upon completion, commands will validate to the 
RSSO that all cleared Navy personnel are assigned to the appropriate SMO Code 
by 31 August 2023, annotating necessary changes to the list. 
    c.  Per reference (a), Commanders at all levels who manage personnel that 
are not in Intelligence Community billets but require continuing access to 
SCI will review and revalidate the continuing need for their personnel to 
have access to SCI and ensure that those personnel have a valid SCI non-
disclosure agreement on file with their assigned Regional SSO (RSSO) by 30 
September 2023. 
 
5.  Information Security.  Commanders who manage SCIFs are responsible for 
protecting CNSI maintained in that SCIF.  Commanders must have an established 
system of security checks performed at the close of each duty day and 
implement random entry and exit security searches of personal belongings in 
SCIFs on a routine basis to protect unauthorized or accidental removal of 
CNSI from the SCIF. Commanders will ensure hand carrying of classified 
material is minimized to the greatest extent possible per established 
procedures and policy and does not pose unacceptable risk to the information. 
    a.  Commanders must approve, in writing, all equipment used to reproduce 
CNSI and post the approval in a conspicuous location. Commanders will ensure 
activity security procedures are in place to appropriately safeguard CNSI 
that may be retained in copiers, facsimile machines, computers, other IT 
peripherals, and display systems. 
    b.  Commanders are responsible to ensure prompt and appropriate 
management, mitigation, and investigative action is taken in cases of 
compromise, unauthorized disclosure, or loss of classified information or 
Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Commanders or security personnel 
shall report any violation of reference (e) or loss or compromise of 
classified information or CUI, as determined by a security inquiry, 
preliminary inquiry, or command investigation, to DISS.  Commanders will 
advise their ISIC of compromises within their area of security responsibility 
or assigned personnel.  If you do not have security cognizance over the 
incident, ensure the incident is reported to the appropriate authority, to 
include forwarding the incident to your Command SSO, Navy RSSO, and SSO Navy. 
    c.  Personally-owned portable electronic devices (P-PED) (such as 
wireless phones of any type, any wireless technology, and/or smart watches), 
including fitness tracking devices (such as FITBITS, rings, and other fitness 
tracking devices), pose an unacceptable risk to CNSI.  Per references (a), 
(b), (c) and (f), Navy SCI security policy prohibits the introduction into a 
SCIF of any P-PED that contains embedded modems, cameras, microphones, or any 
capability to electronically record, store, and/or transmit data, text, 
images, video, or audio data.  Electronic medical devices, including but not 
limited to implanted medical devices (e.g. pacemakers, electronic nerve 
stimulators), hearing aids, insulin pumps, blood glucose monitors, and 
supporting equipment may be permitted in a DON SCIF with approval from their 
Navy RSSO. Requests for wear or use of electronic medical devices will be 
considered upon receipt of orders from a physician.  It is the responsibility 
of all individuals who are SCI cleared and work in a SCIF to not allow the 
introduction of unauthorized P-PEDs into SCIFs.  The unauthorized 
introduction of a P-PED into a SCIF will be deemed a security incident and 
can result in the loss of access to a DON SCIF and/or SCI. 
 
6.  SCIF Physical Security.  Accordingly to the Department of State Security 
Environment Threat List and the National Security Agency Information 
Assurance Technical Capabilities Report, over the past five years the 
technical threat level has increased across a number of categories due to 
advances in technology.  These threats seek and take advantage of SCIF 
vulnerabilities, requiring an increased technical security posture to protect 
CNSI.  Enhancements, captured in references (g) and (h), to existing and 
future SCIFs are required to defeat this growing threat.  Per reference (a), 
Commanders will ensure that all accredited SCIFs comply with the requirements 
in reference (f).  SSO Navy or the Navy RSSO serves as a resource to assist 
Commanders in implementing reference (f). 
    a.  To ensure that SCIFs provide necessary security, reference (i) 
requires the installation of an approved RF shielding product on all SCIF 
perimeter surfaces (walls, floors, ceilings, windows, and doors) of new SCIF 
construction projects or when DIA issues an update to the TEMPEST 
Countermeasure Review (TCR) for an existing SCIF.  This includes SCIFs 
previously accredited under Director of Central Intelligence Directive 6/9 
standards.  This requirement also applies to collateral facilities under 
consideration for conversion to a SCIF. 
    b.  SCIFs that receive an updated TCR requiring RF shielding will submit 
a Plan of Action and Milestone (POA&M) per references (h) and (i) for 
submission to DIA using a standard memorandum format signed by the Command 
Senior Intelligence Officer and routed through the local Navy RSSO and SSO 
Navy.  The POA&M will provide a timeline and corrective actions to ensure 
resolution of the TCR requirements. The POA&M will cover the expected 
timeline for receipt of funding for the project, estimated project initiation 
and completion dates, and temporary TEMPEST mitigations until the RF 
shielding requirement is achieved.  Prior to the commencement of construction 
of the SCIF, a Construction Security Plan must be approved by DIA, via the 
Navy RSSO and SSO Navy. 
    c.  Due to the anticipated costs of the new requirements, SSO Navy 
strongly encourages all commands to survey their respective SCIF 
accreditation and TCRs to determine if they fall under one of the situations 
listed above that may require an application of TEMPEST countermeasures.   
Commands identifying possible deficiencies should begin working with their 
RSSO now to identify solutions and program for construction. 
    d.  SCIFs with a DIA-approved POA&M and granted temporary TEMPEST 
accreditation will not be authorized to install any wireless information 
technology systems within the SCIF perimeter until applicable IC wireless 
policies are approved by DIA. 
 
7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.
