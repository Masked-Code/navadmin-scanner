RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening date for subject selection 
board as 15 November 2021.  The following list indicates the eligible Navy 
captains name, Active Duty list number and date of rank of the senior and 
junior officers on the Active Duty list in the competitive category of the 
judge advocate generals corps, who are eligible to opt-in for consideration 
as of the date of this NAVADMIN: 
Sr Eligible - Henriques, E           01149250          1 JUL 2009 
Jr Eligible - Burke, H               01679000          1 OCT 2018 
 
2.  If the officer selected has a mandatory retirement date between 
1 December 2021 and 1 September 2025, the board shall reconvene as a 
continuation selection board to consider the officer for continuation on 
Active Duty. 
 
3.  In line with this paragraph, only officers who affirmatively request 
consideration by the board will be eligible for selection. Only eligible 
officers who are opting-in may communicate with a promotion selection board 
via the letter to the board (LTB) process. Reference (b) announced the 
introduction of a new application known as electronic submission of selection 
board documents (ESSBD), accessible through MyNavy Portal (MNP).  ESSBD 
improves the speed, transparency and confidence of receipt over current LTB 
submission methods, such as hard copy and e-mail submitted letters and 
related attachments. 
    a.  ESSBD will be available for all promotion, advancement and 
selection boards. 
    b.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to 
electronically submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without 
attachments and will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) 
exactly what will be delivered and presented to the board. 
    c.  To use ESSBD, candidates must access document services through MNP 
at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record.  On-screen instructions will 
direct the submitter thereafter. 
    d.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted.  If required, a full visual user 
guide is available at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-
promotion. 
    e.  Interested officers must submit a written LTB to the board president 
requesting eligibility for consideration.  This request and any other written 
communication that the officer wishes to submit for the boards consideration 
must arrive no later than (NLT) 15 calendar days before the convening date of 
the board and shall be addressed to:  President, Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, 
Assistant Judge Advocate General (Operations and Management) and Assistant 
Judge Advocate General of the Navy Selection Board #108.  The deadline for 
submission shall be 31 October 21, 2359 central daylight time.  Only officers 
submitting a request to be considered will be eligible and their records will 
be presented to the board for consideration. 
    f.  If sending a board package from a non-NMCI network 
(bumed.mil,eu.navy.mil, etc.), please review procedures listed in reference 
(b). 
    g.  The written communication may call attention to the board any matter 
concerning the record of the officer that the officer considers 
important.  Written communication may include, as enclosures, correspondence 
from any individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not 
originated by the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of 
the eligible officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must 
contain a written acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she 
desires such correspondence be presented to the board. 
Correspondence without such an acknowledgement is considered third-party 
correspondence and will be returned without being presented to the 
board.  Classified correspondence will not be accepted. 
 
4.  The following officers are not eligible and their records will not be 
presented to the board for consideration, notwithstanding the timely 
submission of a written LTB president: 
    a.  Any officer who has an approved voluntary separation/retirement 
request, submitted by the officer and not required by policy, NLT 10 days 
before the convening date of the board. 
    b.  Any officer who was recommended by a previous selection board for 
appointment as an Assistant Judge Advocate General of the Navy or any officer 
whose three-year tour as the Assistant Judge Advocate General (Operations and 
Management) would extend the officers service beyond his or her 62nd 
birthday.
