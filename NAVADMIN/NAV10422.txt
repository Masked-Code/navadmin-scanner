SUBJ/FAMILYGRAM 09-10 CHAPLAINCY SERVICES AND LIFE-WORK BALANCE// 

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THAT THIS FAMILYGRAM IS THE NINTH IN A 
SERIES DESIGNED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON SUPPORT SERVICES, ASSISTANCE 
AND ENTITLEMENTS AVAILABLE TO NAVY FAMILIES.  THIS MONTH'S THREE-PART 
FOCUS IS ON SERVICES PROVIDED BY OUR NAVY CHAPLAINS, NAVY LIFE-WORK 
BALANCE INITIATIVES, AND THE SERVICES AND INFORMATION PROVIDED BY 
MILITARY ONESOURCE WEBINARS.

2.  CHAPLAIN SUPPORT.  NAVY CHAPLAINS SERVE ALL SERVICE MEMBERS AND 
THEIR FAMILIES, NOT JUST INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS BELONGING TO SPECIFIC 
RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS.  CHAPLAINS ARE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES OF A 
BROAD RANGE OF RELIGIOUS FAITH GROUPS AND CONDUCT DIVINE SERVICES AND 
CEREMONIES APPROPRIATE TO THEIR FAITH TRADITION.  ADDITIONALLY, 
CHAPLAINS FACILITATE THE RELIGIOUS MINISTRY REQUIREMENTS OF FAITH GROUPS 
OTHER THAN THEIR OWN AND OFFICIATE AT COMMAND FUNCTIONS.  CHAPLAINS ARE 
ESSENTIAL MEMBERS OF FAMILY SUPPORT TEAMS WORKING IN CONCERT WITH THE 
COMMAND, OMBUDSMAN, FAMILY READINESS GROUPS AND FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT 
CENTERS.  CHAPLAINS ADVISE THE COMMAND ON CRITICAL MORALE, PERSONAL AND 
FAMILY READINESS RELATED ISSUES, WHILE OFFERING ESSENTIAL ADVICE TO 
OTHER TEAM MEMBERS.  CHAPLAINS ALSO PROVIDE CONFIDENTIAL CARE AND ARE 
QUALIFIED TO HELP NAVY FAMILIES FIND SOLUTIONS TO PERSONAL, FAMILY, 
MARITAL, AND SPIRITUAL DILEMMAS AND ARE A VALUABLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION 
FOR RESOURCES AND REFERRALS.  CHAPLAINS ASSIGNED TO THE CHAPLAINS 
RELIGIOUS ENRICHMENT DEVELOPMENT OPERATION (CREDO) OFFER WEEKEND 
RETREATS INCONUS, EUROPE, AND THE PACIFIC TO STRENGTHEN FAMILIES AND 
ENRICH MARRIAGES.  GENERAL INFORMATION ON CHAPLAIN CORPS RESOURCES CAN 
BE FOUND AT YOUR LOCAL COMMAND OR ONLINE AT 
HTTP://CHAPLAINCARE.NAVY.MIL.

3.  LIFE-WORK INITIATIVES.  NAVY'S GOAL IS TO PROVIDE A MENU OF 
WORKFORCE OPTIONS AIMED AT NOT ONLY SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACTING TALENTED 
SAILORS, BUT ALSO RETAINING THEM FOR THE DURATION OF A SUCCESSFUL 
MILITARY CAREER.  NAVY HAS SEVERAL INITIATIVES IN PLACE THAT CAN BENEFIT 
THE PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL GOALS OF OUR SAILORS, INCLUDING:
    A.  PARENTING AND FAMILY INITIATIVES.
        (1) A 12-MONTH OPERATIONAL DEFERMENT FOR NEW MOTHERS TO SUPPORT 
BREASTFEEDING, BONDING, AND INFANT CHILDCARE.  THIS IS CURRENTLY THE 
MOST COMPREHENSIVE POLICY OF ALL THE MILITARY SERVICES (FOR MORE 
INFORMATION SEE NAVADMIN 157/07).
        (2) 10 DAYS OF ADMINISTRATIVE PATERNITY LEAVE FOR MARRIED NEW
FATHERS (FOR MORE INFORMATION SEE NAVADMIN 341/08).
        (3) 21 DAYS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE FOR ADOPTIVE PARENTS (FOR
 MORE INFORMATION SEE NAVADMIN 157/07).
    B.  FLEXIBLE WORK OPTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT SELECT COMMANDS, 
TO
INCLUDE ADJUSTABLE WORK SCHEDULES AND COMPRESSED WORK WEEKS, WHICH 
LENGTHEN WORK DAYS AND CONDENSE THE WORK WEEK TO FOUR DAYS.
    C.  A CAREER INTERMISSION PILOT PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS SERVICE MEMBERS 
TO
TEMPORARILY TRANSITION FROM ACTIVE DUTY INTO THE INDIVIDUAL READY 
RESERVE FOR UP TO THREE YEARS  (FOR MORE INFORMATION SEE NAVADMIN 095/09
