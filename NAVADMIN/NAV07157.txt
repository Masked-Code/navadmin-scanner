RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE COMPREHENSIVE REVISION OF NAVYS 
PREGNANCY AND PARENTHOOD POLICY IN REF A.  THIS UPDATE TO REF A 
INCORPORATES LEGISLATIVE AND DOD CHANGES TO POLICY AND PRACTICES 
REGARDING PREGNANT SERVICEWOMEN AND NEW PARENTS.  IT ALSO REPRESENTS 
OUR ENDURING COMMITMENT TO MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING A HEALTHY 
LIFE/WORK BALANCE FOR OUR NAVY FAMILY.
2.  THE REVISED GUIDELINES INCLUDE:

12 MONTHS (POST DELIVERY).  A WAIVER OPTION TO RETURN EARLY TO 
OPERATIONAL DUTY PRIOR TO THE CONCLUSION OF 12 MONTHS IS INCLUDED.
B.  NEW POLICY REQUIRING SERVICEWOMEN WITH UNCOMPLICATED PREGNANCIES 
AND DELIVERIES TO CONTINUE TO PERFORM AN INDIVIDUALIZED EXERCISE 
PROGRAM (INCORPORATING MILD TO MODERATE EXERCISE IN SESSIONS OF 30 
MINUTES DURATION THREE OR MORE TIMES PER WEEK DURING THEIR PREGNANCY 
AND BEGINNING SIX WEEKS AFTER DELIVERY).
C.  NEW POLICY RESTRICTING SERVICEWOMEN FROM PROVIDING SURROGATE 
PREGNANCY SERVICES.  THIS CHANGE ALIGNS NAVY POLICY WITH THAT CONTAINED 
IN SECNAVINST 1000.10A (DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY POLICY ON PARENTHOOD AND 
PREGNANCY).
D.  NEW POLICY TO REFLECT CHANGES IN LAW REQUIRING COMMANDING OFFICERS 
TO AUTHORIZE UP TO 21 DAYS PERMISSIVE TEMPORARY ADDITIONAL DUTY (TEMADD)

NEW PARENTS WILL RECEIVE EDUCATION PRIOR TO DISCHARGE FROM THE MTF OR

DEPLOYED NEW FATHERS WILL RECEIVE THE SAME EDUCATION FROM OPERATIONAL 
MEDICAL PROVIDERS PRIOR TO THEIR RETURN AND REUNIFICATION WITH THEIR 
FAMILY.
F.  IMPLEMENTATION OF A POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION SCREENING PROGRAM AT MTFS 
SO THAT SERVICEWOMEN CAN BE SCREENED FOR SYMPTOMS OF POSTPARTUM 
DEPRESSION AT THE SIX WEEK POSTPARTUM VISIT.
