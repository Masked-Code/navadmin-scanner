TRANSITION OFFICE ESTABLISHMENT.//

RMKS/1.  WE HAVE WORKED TO IMPROVE PROCESSES RELATED TO TRANSITIONING FROM THE 
ACTIVE COMPONENT (AC) TO RESERVE COMPONENT
(RC) IN ORDER TO BETTER SUPPORT A "CONTINUUM OF SERVICE" FOR BOTH OUR OFFICERS 
AND ENLISTED.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES A SERIES OF CONTINUUM OF SERVICE 
INITIATIVES WHICH IMPACT PERSONNEL AT THE END OF THEIR OBLIGATED SERVICE.  THE 
FOLLOWING INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT SEAMLESS TRANSITION 
BETWEEN AC AND RC:  PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) WITH/SELECTED RESERVE (SELRES) 
OPTION; CAREER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM INTERACTIVE DETAILING (CMS/ID) WITH/SELRES 
OPTION; AND THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CAREER TRANSITION OFFICE (CTO).
SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS (POST 9/11 GI BILL TRANSFERABILITY, AFFILIATION BONUSES, 
RESERVE RETIREMENT ELIGIBILITY, ETC.) ARE AVAILABLE FOR SAILORS WHO CHOOSE TO 
CONTINUE THEIR NAVY CAREER IN THE DRILLING RESERVE.  PTS AND CMS/ID 
APPLICATIONS FOR ENLISTED SAILORS DESIRING TO REMAIN IN THE AC ARE 
FUNCTIONALLY UNCHANGED.

2.  PTS W/SELRES OPTION:  PTS W/SELRES OPTION, PER REF A, BECAME FUNCTIONAL 1 
OCTOBER 2009.  PTS NOW INCLUDES AN OPTION TO OBTAIN A QUOTA FOR AFFILIATION 
WITH THE SELECTED RESERVE (SELRES) AS A DRILLING RESERVIST.  THIS 
FUNCTIONALITY ALLOWS AC ENLISTED SAILORS, INCLUDING FULL TIME SUPPORT (FTS) 
PERSONNEL, TO SIMULTANEOUSLY APPLY FOR BOTH ACTIVE DUTY/FTS RE-ENLISTMENT AND 
SELRES ENLISTMENT QUOTAS.
PTS APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO END OF ACTIVE 
OBLIGATED SERVICE (EAOS) OR EAOS WITH EXTENSION (IF
APPLICABLE) TO MAXIMIZE SAILOR OPPORTUNITIES.  APPLICATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE PROCESSED UNTIL EITHER THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO EAOS OR EXTENDED EAOS, 
WHICHEVER IS LATER.  SAILORS WHO CURRENTLY POSSESS AN APPROVED ACTIVE DUTY/FTS 
PTS RE-ENLISTMENT QUOTA AND HAVE GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS REMAINING UNTIL 
THEIR EAOS OR EXTENDED EAOS MAY CONTINUE TO APPLY FOR A SELRES QUOTA.  
APPLICATIONS FOR THE ACTIVE DUTY/FTS AND SELRES ARE PROCESSED SEPARATELY AND 
WILL BE BASED ON CURRENT PTS SELECTION CRITERIA.  APPROVAL FOR A SELRES QUOTA 
DOES NOT CANCEL THE AC/FTS APPROVAL, BUT DOES PROVIDE THE AC SAILOR AN 
ADDITIONAL OPTION AT EAOS.  SAILORS DESIRING A SELRES QUOTA WILL BE PLACED 
INTO THE APPROPRIATE RC SELRES ZONE CATEGORY BASED ON THEIR PAY ENTRY BASE 
DATE (PEBD).  NOTE THAT SELRES ZONES DIFFER FROM AC ZONES AND ARE AS FOLLOWS:  
ZONE A (18 MONTHS-8 YEARS), ZONE B (8-14 YEARS).  SAILORS COMPETE FOR A SELRES 
QUOTA ONLY IN THE FISCAL YEAR OF THEIR EAOS OR EXTENDED EAOS IN ORDER TO MEET 
PLANNED ACCESSION GOALS AND SHOULD DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF EAOS 
EXTENSIONS WITH THEIR CAREER COUNSELOR.  ONCE A SAILOR IS APPROVED FOR A 
SELRES QUOTA, THE PTS SYSTEM ENABLES THE SAILOR TO VIEW POTENTIAL NAVY 
OPERATIONAL SUPPORT CENTER (NOSC) LOCATIONS (FORMERLY NAVY RESERVE
CENTERS) WITHIN CMS/ID.

3.  CAREER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM INTERACTIVE DETAILING (CMS/ID) WITH SELRES 
OPTION.
    A.  FOR AN ACTIVE DUTY OR FTS ENLISTED SAILOR WITH AN APPROVED AC/FTS PTS 
QUOTA IN THEIR CURRENT OR CONVERTED (TEMPORARY) RATING, THE STANDARD 
APPLICATION, DETAILER SELECTION, AND AC ASSIGNMENT PROCESSES OUTLINED IN REF B 
WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED WITHIN CMS/ID.
    B.  AN ACTIVE DUTY OR FTS ENLISTED SAILOR WITH AN APPROVED SELRES PTS 
QUOTA IN THEIR CURRENT OR CONVERTED (TEMPORARY) RATING IS ABLE TO SUBMIT A 
CMS/ID APPLICATION TO DRILL AT THE NOSC CLOSEST TO THE DESIRED HOME LOCATION 
AFTER COMPLETION OF AC ENLISTMENT.  NOSCS ARE LOCATED IN FLEET CONCENTRATION 
AREAS, IN EVERY STATE, GUAM, AND PUERTO RICO.  AVAILABLE LOCATIONS CAN BE 
VIEWED AND SELECTED UNDER THE NOSC TAB WITHIN CMS/ID.  ONCE A MEMBER'S NOSC 
APPLICATION IS SUBMITTED THROUGH CMS/ID FOR SELRES TRANSITION APPROVAL, THAT 
INFORMATION WILL BE PASSED TO THE CAREER TRANSITION OFFICE (CTO) WHO WILL 
INITIATE CONTACT WITH THE MEMBER TO DISCUSS RC PROGRAMS AND BENEFITS AND 
FACILITATE TRANSITION TO THE RC.  IF A SAILOR IS APPROVED OR CONTINUES TO 
APPLY FOR AN AC/FTS PTS QUOTA, THE NOSC APPLICATION IS NON-BINDING AND ONLY 
OPENS A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE SAILOR AND THE CTO UNTIL THE AC/FTS PTS 
APPLICATION WINDOW CLOSES.
AFTER THE PTS SELRES OPTION IS FINAL, THE SAILOR WILL COMPLETE REQUIRED 
SEPARATION PROCESSING AT THEIR LOSING COMMAND AND SERVICING PSD AND A NOSC 
SPONSOR WILL BE ASSIGNED VIA THE CTO FOR ADDITIONAL TRANSITION ASSISTANCE.  
BILLET ASSIGNMENT IN A RESERVE UNIT IS INDEPENDENT OF NOSC SELECTION AND WILL 
OCCUR AFTER THE SAILOR IS AFFILIATED INTO THE RC AT THEIR APPROVED NOSC.  
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING CMS/ID CAN BE OBTAINED AT HTTPS WEBSITE 
WWW.CMSID.NAVY.MIL.

4.  CAREER TRANSITION OFFICE (CTO):  CTO CAPABILITY IS EXPANDING IN A SPIRAL 
APPROACH OVER THE NEXT 11 MONTHS, PER REF A.  THE OVERALL GOALS OF CTO ARE TO 
PROVIDE INFORMATION TO SAILORS ON THE BENEFITS OF RESERVE AFFILIATION, ASSIST 
SAILOR TRANSITION BETWEEN AC AND RC, AND DECREASE TRANSITION PROCESSING TIMES 
AND POTENTIAL PAY INTERRUPTIONS.  THIS CENTRALIZATION STREAMLINES THE 
TRANSITION PROCESS AND FACILITATES 72 HOUR TRANSITIONS BETWEEN COMPONENTS.
    A.  SPIRAL ONE (OFFICER AC TO RC) AFFECTS ALL DIRECT NAVY VETERAN (NAVET) 
OFFICER TRANSITIONS FROM THE AC TO THE RC THAT WERE APPROVED AFTER 29 MAY 
2009.  NAVETS WITH A BREAK IN SERVICE OR IN THE IRR AND DIRECT COMMISSION 
OFFICERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROCESSED BY A NAVY RECRUITER.  REF C DELINEATES 
SERVICES PROVIDED AND PROCEDURES FOR AC OFFICERS BEING PROCESSED FOR 
TRANSITION BY THE CTO.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SPIRAL ONE OF THE CTO CAN 
BE FOUND AT THE TRANSITION (CTO) TAB ON THE NPC CAREER INFO WEBPAGE AT 
WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/CAREERINFO/TRANSITION.
    B.  SPIRAL TWO (ENLISTED AC TO RC) AFFECTS ALL DIRECT NAVET ENLISTED 
TRANSITIONS FROM THE AC TO THE RC WHO ARE APPROVED THROUGH THE CMS/ID PROCESS.
    C.  SPIRAL THREE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED NLT OCT 2010 AND IS PLANNED TO 
INCLUDE PROCESSING OF DEFINITE (RECALL) AND INDEFINITE RC TO AC TRANSITIONS, 
EXCLUDING MOBILIZATIONS.  IN ADDITION, THE CTO WILL ALSO CENTRALIZE TRANSITION 
PROCESSING ACTIONS FOR ALL OFFICERS AND ENLISTED PERSONNEL DESIRING DIRECT 
AFFILIATION WITH THE RC IN A DRILLING STATUS.

5.  QUESTIONS CONCERNING PTS, CMS/ID, OR CTO SHOULD BE REFERRED TO THE NPC 
CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER, (866)-U-ASK-NPC OR (866) 827-5672, OR EMAIL AT 
CSCMAILBOX(AT)NAVY.MIL.  THE NPC CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER IS MANNED MONDAY 
THROUGH FRIDAY, 0700 TO 1900, CENTRAL STANDARD TIME.
