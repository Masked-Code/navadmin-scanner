RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN revises the timeframe and process for command climate 
assessments (CCA), to include responsibilities for commanders, commanding 
officers, officers-in-charge, and civilian equivalents (subsequently referred 
to as commanders) and immediate superior in command (ISIC). 
 
2.  Desired Outcome.  The Navy's goal is to produce people, leaders, and 
teams that are ready for combat, or to support those who go forward.  The CCA 
process, leveraging the Defense Organizational Climate Survey (DEOCS) 
provides commanders with invaluable and actionable insight into their 
commands so that local conditions get better over time. 
 
3.  CCA (revised timeline and process).  Reference (a) changed the time frame 
for annual CCAs and change of command CCAs.  The command resilience team 
(CRT) should leverage references (b) and (c), and administer CCA in line with 
the following: 
    a.  Annual CCA: 
       (1) Consist of a DEOCS, and involve consideration of multiple sources 
of information such as administrative records review, reports, interview 
data, focus groups, or other existing data. 
       (2) Start no earlier than 1 August and conclude by 30 November, which 
is called the CCA fielding window. 
       (3) Must initiate the DEOCS no later than 31 October. 
       (4) Is considered complete when the commander signs their executive 
summary and plan of action and milestones (POAM). 
       (5) Should be debriefed to the ISIC within 60 calendar days of 
completion.  Email review and reply are not acceptable. 
       (6) For 2023, all commanders must conduct an annual CCA during the CCA 
fielding window, regardless of when their last CCA occurred. 
       (7) Commanders who conducted a CCA between 1 February 2023 and 31 July 
2023, and who do not have significant changes in DEOCS results from DEOCS 
conducted during the required period (1 August 2023 - 31 October 2023), are 
not required to conduct an administrative records review, interview, and 
focus group data review. 
    b.  Change of Command CCAs: 
       (1) Must occur within 90 days after assumption of command or office. 
       (2) If the change of command occurs outside of the annual CCA fielding 
window, the change of command CCA should not include a DEOCS if one has been 
conducted in the last calendar year. 
       (3) Consists of a review of the previous CCA(s) to assess progress and 
make adjustments, and should include a review of updated administrative 
records, reports, interview data, focus groups, and other data as available. 
       (4) Must be debriefed to the ISIC within 30 calendar days of 
completion.  Email review and reply are not acceptable. 
 
4.  CCA Responsibilities (commander and ISIC): 
    a.  Survey Participation: 
       (1) All Service Members and civilian employees in the command or 
organization must have the opportunity to participate, but survey 
participation is voluntary.  However, commanders, command leadership and 
command resilience team (CRT) members should actively promote maximum survey 
participation and provide opportunities for all personnel (military and DoD 
civilians) to take surveys during work hours. 
       (2) Commanders should be transparent with their Sailors.  The 
consistent best practice for increasing survey participation is a thorough 
debrief of the CCA, and then following through on POAM actions, with the 
status briefed to the command on a periodic basis. 
       (3) Historically, the Navy has averaged about 40 percent DEOCS 
participation.  The higher the voluntary survey participation is in a unit, 
the higher the confidence commanders can have that the results represent the 
views of the unit. 
       (4) Commanders and CRT members should pay special attention to the 
written comments in the DEOCS as they may provide awareness of previously 
undetected issues to the attention of the CRT. 
    b.  Protective and Risk Factors.  DEOCS provides data on protective and 
risk factors.  These factors provide leading indicators of successful mission 
accomplishment and the potential for harmful behaviors such as suicide and 
sexual assault. Commanders remain accountable for totality of their climate, 
but based on Navy-wide data, the following guidance is provided: 
       (1) Protective Factors.  Within the 11 protective factors, commanders 
should prioritize the development of Connectedness and Inclusion. 
       (2) Risk Factors.  Within the 11 risk factors, commanders must 
actively reduce conditions that result in moderate-high stress, frequent 
workplace hostility, and presence of harassing behaviors (sexual and 
racial).  This includes taking action to address microclimates within a 
command where these risk factors are high. 
       (3) Additional information on protective and risk factors is 
contained on the fact sheet posted with this NAVADMIN on 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/. 
    c.  ISIC Responsibilities.  ISICs may adjust the timing of the Annual CCA 
or change of command CCA based on operational requirements. 
    d.  Echelon 2 Commanders.  By 31 March each year, each echelon 2 must 
report annual CCA ISIC debrief status to Navy Culture and Resilience Office 
(OPNAV N17), breaking out commands that have requested a waiver or are 
incomplete. 
 
5.  Prevention and Response Programs (OPNAV N170) will set up several town 
halls for command climate specialists to discuss and answer questions about 
the new CCA process and requirements. Command Triad and CRT members are 
highly encouraged to attend.  Town hall dates will be posted 
on https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/Culture-Resilience/Equal-
Opportunity/Command-Climate-Specialists/. 
 
6.  Questions about the CCA process can be forwarded to the appropriate 
echelon 2 command climate specialists, the Integrated Primary Prevention 
Program mailbox, OPNAV_IPP.fct@navy.mil; or Navy Harassment and Military 
Equal Opportunity Advice Line, at (703) 604-1037 or via e-mail at 
MILL_Navy_EO_Advice@navy.mil.
