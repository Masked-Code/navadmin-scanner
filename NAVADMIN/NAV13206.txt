RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels ref (a) and announces the renewal and 
restructuring of the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) critical skills 
accession bonus (CSAB) for chief warrant officers (CWO) in 
designators 7151 and 7171.  Accessing NSW CWOs is a priority for the
Navy.  The NSW CSAB is part of the Navy's overarching effort to size, 
shape, and stabilize the NSW force.  Special Warfare Operators (SO)
or Special Warfare Boat Operators (SB) selected for CWO that meet the
eligibility criteria in this NAVADMIN may apply. 

2.  Program Authority.  Ref (b), Section 324 authorizes the Secretary
of the Navy to offer officer accession bonus payments to commissioned 
officers with critical skills as designated by the Secretary of 
Defense.  The Chief of Naval Personnel has been delegated authority 
to administer the NSW CSAB program.  The NSW officer community manager 
(OCM) will act as program manager and exercise management control of 
the NSW CSAB paid to members as an accession incentive.

3.  Program Overview.  CWO selectees may apply for a bonus level of 
$45,000 for accepting a commission and serving on active duty in 
designators 7151 and 7171 for a 6 year obligated service period after
commissioning.  All applicants for this bonus program must submit an 
application through their commanding officer to the NSW OCM for 
approval, processing, and tracking.  The eligibility criteria stated 
in this NAVADMIN can be changed at any time by the program manager if 
a bonus reduction is warranted based on the needs of the NSW community.

4.  Program Eligibility:
    a.  Applicants must be active duty service members selected by a 
Navy CWO selection board for commissioning in designators 7151 or 7171.
    b.  FY-15 CWO selectees and beyond who accept an appointment to 
CWO, and who are currently on a NSW Critical Skills Retention Bonus 
(CSRB) contract, will be ineligible to receive or apply for a NSW CSAB.
    c.  Applicants must have their commanding officers endorsement.

5.  Program Payments and Obligated Service Agreement.  Qualified 
applicants who completed the Navy CWO Academy may receive a $45,000 
bonus, and will incur a 6 year active duty service obligation.

6.  Program Execution:
    a.  Members should submit request letter for the NSW CSAB to the
program manager 60 to 90 days prior to entering into a NSW CSAB 
contract via their chain of command.
    b.  Upon acceptance of a member's agreement, and graduation from
the Navy CWO Academy, the amount of the bonus becomes fixed and the 
member incurs a firm service obligation.
    c.  Service members will receive the bonus in a lump sum payment, 
effective from the date of commissioning.

7.  Application Process:
    a.  Eligible NSW CWO selectees may apply for NSW CSAB via their 
commanding officer.  Submit applications by mail to:
         OPNAV N131H

        (2) Commanding officer's endorsement letter.

8.  Recoupment and Repayment Policy.  Repayment policy is governed 
by section 373 of ref (b), and ref (c).  A member of the uniformed 
services who enters into a written agreement with specified service 
conditions for receipt of a bonus is entitled to the full amount of 
the bonus if the member fulfills the conditions of that written 
agreement.  If the member fails to fulfill the service conditions 
specified in the written agreement for the pay, then the pay may be 
terminated and the member may be required to repay an amount equal 
to the unearned portion of the pay.
