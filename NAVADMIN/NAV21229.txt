SUBJ/CENTENNIAL OF UNITED STATES NAVY AIRCRAFT CARRIERS// 
 
RMKS/1.  The Department of the Navy will recognize the Centennial of United 
States Navy Aircraft Carriers (CONAC) in calendar year 2022. 
 
2.  On 20 March 1922, following a two year conversion at Norfolk Naval 
Shipyard, the former USS Jupiter (Collier #3) was recommissioned as the 
United States Navy’s first aircraft carrier USS Langley (CV 1). Named in 
honor of Samuel Pierpont Langley, an American aircraft pioneer and engineer, 
CV 1 started as an experimental platform but was quickly proven an invaluable 
weapons system that changed how the US Navy fought at sea.  In the nearly 
100 years since, from CV 1 to CVN 78, aircraft carriers have been the Navy’s 
preeminent power projection platform and have served the nations interest in 
times of war and peace.  With an unequaled ability to provide warfighting 
capabilities across the full spectrum of conflict, and to adapt in an ever-
changing world, aircraft carriers, their air wings, and associated strike 
groups are the foundation of US maritime strategy. 
 
3.  The 2018 National Defense Authorization Act codified the sense of 
Congress that The people of the United States should be encouraged to 
celebrate the history of aircraft carriers in the United States and to always 
remember the vital role these vessels play in defending the nations freedom. 
It is appropriate that during the Centennial of United States Navy Aircraft 
Carriers, the Department of the Navy and the American public be afforded the 
opportunity to recognize the contributions of aircraft carriers to our 
national security and become acquainted with their rich and colorful 
heritage. 
 
4.  Commander, Naval Air Forces will be the executive agent for planning and 
executing all events associated with the Centennial of United States Navy 
Aircraft Carriers throughout calendar year 2022. 
Commander, Naval Air Forces will: 
    a. Designate a CONAC coordinator. 
    b. Establish membership for the CONAC working group. 
    c. Coordinate and engage with cognizant stakeholders and organizations 
supporting CONAC events and venues. 
    d. Ensure CONAC themes are guided by, and supportive of, Navy’s strategic 
messaging. 
 
5.  The Centennial of United States Navy Aircraft Carriers affords the nation 
the opportunity to honor the legacy of United States Navy aircraft carriers 
and the Sailors who serve aboard them, and to reaffirm their contributions to 
our country’s safety, security and prosperity.
