SUBJ/PASSING OF FORMER MASTER CHIEF PETTY OFFICER OF THE NAVY WILLIAM H. 
PLACKETT, USN (RET)//

RMKS/1.  It is with deep regret to report the passing of former Master Chief 
Petty Officer of the Navy (MCPON) William "Bill" H. Plackett, USN (RET) on 4 
March 2016.  MCPON Plackett enlisted in the United States Navy when he was 19 
years of age in 1956.  Following graduation from Recruit Training Command, he 
attended Radarman "A" school in Norfolk, Virginia and was assigned to the 
Naval Control of Shipping Office in Bahrain.

2.  Highlights of his 32 years of distinguished honorable service include the 
following accomplishments:
    a.  In 1984 he was appointed as the sixth Master Chief Petty Officer of 
the Navy.
    b.  His unrelenting drive was behind initiatives regarding accessible 
training for command master chiefs, women's equal opportunity and integration 
and enforcing the High Year Tenure policy.
    c.  MCPON Plackett was highly involved with the creation of the Family 
Advocacy Program, OPNAVINST 1752.2, providing much needed guidance and 
establishing many of our vital family programs today.

3.  Following his retirement in 1988, he moved to Virginia and worked in the 
private sector, while continuing his involvement with the Navy community.

4.  MCPON Plackett is survived by his wife Karen and four children.  He was a 
remarkable leader and an incredible shipmate who generously served his nation 
with honor, courage, and commitment.  He will be truly missed by his 
community and the Navy family.

5.  Released by Vice Admiral R. L. Thomas, Director, Navy Staff//
