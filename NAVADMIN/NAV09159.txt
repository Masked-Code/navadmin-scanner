RMKS/1. PER REF A, THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS (CNO) APPROVED AND 
DIRECTED IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW ALIGNMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF NAVAL 
INTELLIGENCE MANPOWER. THIS ACTION IS NECESSARY TO MEET CURRENT AND 
PROJECTED FLEET OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS WITH IMPROVED INTELLIGENCE 
CAPABILITY WHILE REMAINING WITHIN EXISTING NAVAL INTELLIGENCE MANPOWER 
CONSTRAINTS. PER REF B, COMMANDER, NAVAL NETWORK WARFARE COMMAND 
(NNWC), AS THE INTELLIGENCE TYPE COMMANDER IS TASKED WITH EXECUTING THE 
INTELLIGENCE MANPOWER DISTRIBUTION PLAN WITH AUTHORITIES AS DELEGATED 
BY CNO AND COMMANDER, U.S. FLEET FORCES COMMAND (USFF), WITH INITIAL 
OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY OF OCTOBER 2009 AND FINAL OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY 
OF OCTOBER 2010.

2. THE CNO-APPROVED ALIGNMENT STRUCTURE EMPLOYS A HYBRID DIRECT SUPPORT
(DIRSUP) CONSTRUCT. AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND LARGE DECK AMPHIBIOUS SHIPS 
WILL RETAIN A REDUCED PERMANENT INTELLIGENCE COMPLEMENT AND WILL BE 
AUGMENTED BY DEDICATED FLEET INTELLIGENCE DETACHMENTS FOR UNDERWAY 
TRAINING, DEPLOYMENT, AND SURGE REQUIREMENTS. GUIDING PRINCIPLES 
INCLUDE:
A. FLEET OPERATIONAL FORCES REMAIN PARAMOUNT. CVN/LHA/LHD WILL CONTINUE 
TO WORK-UP AND DEPLOY WITH INTELLIGENCE TEAMS MANNED AT LEVELS 
CONSISTENT WITH RECENT DEPLOYMENTS, BUT THE TEAMS WILL BE BETTER 
TRAINED AND MORE HIGHLY SKILLED. WHEN NOT EMBARKED, FLEET INTELLIGENCE 
DETACHMENTS WILL BE EMPLOYED IN OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTERS 
PROVIDING DEDICATED REACH-BACK SUPPORT TO DEPLOYED OPERATING FORCES, 
FURTHER ENHANCING SUPPORT TO FLEET OPERATIONAL UNITS.
B. MEET NEW FLEET AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS WITH RAPIDLY ADAPTIVE 
INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY. ALREADY PROGRAMMED INCREASES IN CVN/LHA/LHD 
INTELLIGENCE NMP, BEYOND RECENT DEPLOYMENT LEVELS, WILL BE 
RECAPITALIZED TO FLEET INTELLIGENCE DETACHMENTS TAILORED TO PROVIDE 
INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY TO MEET INCREASED FLEET DEMANDS FOR SUCH THINGS 
AS MARITIME INTERCEPTION OPERATIONS INTELLIGENCE EXPLOITATION TEAMS 
(MIO-IET), SCAN EAGLE UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE DETACHMENTS, NUCLEAR-
POWERED CRUISE MISSILE SUBMARINE DETACHMENTS, AND SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS, 
OR OTHER PRIORITIES AS IDENTIFIED BY OPERATIONAL COMMANDERS. 
ADDITIONALLY, FLEET INTELLIGENCE DETACHMENTS WILL PROVIDE ENHANCED 
INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY TO MARITIME OPERATIONS CENTERS AND SERVE AS THE 
PRIMARY SOURCE FOR MEETING FLEET OBLIGATIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEES 
IN SUPPORT OF VALIDATED COMBATANT COMMANDER REQUIREMENTS.
C. UNITY OF COMMAND. FLEET INTELLIGENCE DETACHMENTS WILL BE 
ADMINISTRATIVELY ALIGNED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF NNWC. WHEN EMBARKED, 
DEPLOYED, OR OPERATIONALLY EMPLOYED, THE FLEET INTELLIGENCE DETACHMENTS 
WILL REPORT TO THE APPROPRIATE OPERATIONAL COMMANDER.

3. RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTING THIS CNO-DIRECTED ALIGNMENT IS AS 
FOLLOWS:
A. U.S. FLEET FORCES COMMAND WILL COORDINATE WITH COMMANDER, U.S. 
PACIFIC FLEET TO CHARACTERIZE ALL FLEET INTELLIGENCE DETACHMENT BILLETS 
BY PAYGRADE AND NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION BY JULY 2009, PUBLISH A 
BILLET ALIGNMENT PLAN TO STAKEHOLDERS BY AUGUST 2009, AND ALIGN ALL 
FLEET INTELLIGENCE DETACHMENT BILLETS FROM THE AIR AND SURFACE TYPE 
COMMANDERS (TYCOMS) TO NNWC NO LATER THAN OCTOBER 2009.
B. NNWC IS ASSIGNED MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTION RESPONSIBILITIES. AFFECTED 
TYCOMS, PRINCIPALLY NAVAL AIR FORCES AND NAVAL SURFACE FORCES, WILL 
PARTICIPATE DURING THE TRANSITION.
C. NO COST/DIVERT/PCS ROTATIONS INTO FLEET INTELLIGENCE DETACHMENTS 
WILL COMMENCE AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE FULL OPERATING 
CAPABILITY NO LATER THAN 1 OCTOBER 2010.

4. ALL PENDING INTELLIGENCE BILLET ACTIONS POTENTIALLY IMPACTING THIS 
ALIGNMENT (OTHER THAN THOSE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PROGRAM OBJECTIVE 
MEMORANDUM
INITIATIVES) ARE HELD IN ABEYANCE UNLESS APPROVED BY USFF.

5. NAVAL INTELLIGENCE ALIGNMENT AS A TOPIC IS UNCLASSIFIED. SPECIFIC 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUPPORTING STUDY DATA MAY BE CLASSIFIED PER SOURCES 
USED AND ASSOCIATED GOVERNING REGULATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS.

6. PUBLIC AFFAIRS (PA) POSTURE IS RESPONSE TO QUERY ONLY. PA CONTACTS 
SHOULD GO THROUGH THE CHIEF OF INFORMATION OFFICE.

7. RELEASED BY VICE ADMIRAL J. C. HARVEY, JR., DIRECTOR, NAVY STAFF.//
