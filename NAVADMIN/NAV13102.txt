RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN SOLICITS APPLICATIONS AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR THE FY-
14 SEAMAN TO ADMIRAL-21 (STA-21) COMMISSIONING PROGRAM.

2.  STA-21 IS A FULL-TIME UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION AND COMMISSIONING PROGRAM 
OPEN TO ENLISTED PERSONNEL OF ALL PAYGRADES AND RATINGS WHO MEET ELIGIBILITY 
REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIED IN REF A AND ON THE STA-21 WEBSITE.  SELECTEES ARE 
PROVIDED A MAXIMUM OF 36 MONTHS OF FULL-TIME, YEAR-ROUND STUDY TO COMPLETE A 
BACCALAUREATE DEGREE.  INDIVIDUALS SELECTED FOR THE STA-21 PROGRAM WILL REMAIN 
ON ACTIVE DUTY WHILE ATTENDING COLLEGE AND RECEIVE PAY, ALLOWANCES, BENEFITS, 
AND PRIVILEGES OF CURRENT PAYGRADE.  IN ADDITION, SELECTEES WILL RECEIVE AN 
EDUCATION VOUCHER FOR UP TO $10,000 PER YEAR TO COVER TUITION, FEES, AND BOOK 
COSTS.

3.  DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF APPLICATIONS FOR THE FY-14 STA-21 PROGRAM IS 1 
JULY 2013.  HOWEVER, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT APPLICATIONS BE MAILED PRIOR TO 
THE DEADLINE.  APPLICATION PACKAGES MUST BE POSTMARKED ON OR BEFORE THE 
DEADLINE DATE.  EARLY SUBMISSION IS BETTER, AS THIS WILL ALLOW FEEDBACK TO THE 
SAILOR FOR SUBMISSION OF MISSING OR ILLEGIBLE DOCUMENTS.  DEADLINE FOR 
SUBMISSION OF ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION TO AN APPLICANT'S PACKAGE IS 1 AUGUST 
2013.  NO ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS CAN BE ADDED AFTER THIS DATE.  THE SELECTION 
BOARD WILL CONVENE IN SEPTEMBER 2013 AND THE SELECTEES WILL BE ANNOUNCED VIA 
NAVADMIN IN OCTOBER 2013.

4.  THE FOLLOWING TARGET OPTIONS AND CORE ARE OPEN FOR APPLICATION FOR THE FY-
14 SELECTION BOARD:  SURFACE WARFARE (SWO), SURFACE WARFARE/ENGINEERING DUTY

WARFARE/OCEANOGRAPHY (SWO/OCEANO), NUCLEAR, SPECIAL WARFARE (SEAL), EXPLOSIVE 
ORDNANCE DISPOSAL (EOD), NAVAL FLIGHT OFFICER (NFO), PILOT, CIVIL ENGINEERING 
CORPS (CEC), AND NURSE CORPS.  

5.  THE FOLLOWING TARGET OPTIONS HAVE ZERO SELECT OPPORTUNITY FOR FY-14:  
HUMAN RESOURCES, INTELLIGENCE, INFORMATION WARFARE, MEDICAL CORPS, 
OCEANOGRAPHY, AND SUPPLY CORPS. 

6.  LESSONS LEARNED.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ADDRESSES LESSONS LEARNED FROM 
THE FY-13 STA-21 SELECTION PROCESS AND BOARD.  THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO 
PRECLUDE COMMON ERRORS:
    A.  OF THE 674 APPLICATIONS RECEIVED FOR FY-13, ONLY 569 WERE BOARD 
ELIGIBLE.  A TOTAL OF 50 WERE SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FY-13 STA-21 
PROGRAM.
    B.  EACH YEAR, PACKAGES ARE NOT CONSIDERED DUE TO NON-QUALIFYING SAT/ACT 
TEST SCORES, SAT/ACT TEST SCORES NOT SUBMITTED, MISSING COMMANDING OFFICER 
(CO) ENDORSEMENT, RECENT NON-JUDICIAL PUNISHMENT, MISSING PHYSICAL FITNESS 
ASSESSMENT CYCLES, MISSING OR ILLEGIBLE SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTS, AND NOT 
MEETING AGE REQUIREMENTS.
    C.  MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET BEFORE SUBMITTING AN 
APPLICATION.  THE SELECTION PROCESS IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE.  APPLICATIONS 
SHOULD BE MAILED ONLY WHEN FULLY COMPLETE.  OFFICER INTERVIEW BOARDS SHALL 
CONSIST OF THREE OFFICERS; THE APPLICANT'S CO IS NOT A BOARD MEMBER AND SHOULD 
NOT SUBMIT AN INTERVIEW APPRAISAL SHEET.  THE CO'S PERSONAL INTERVIEW SHOULD 
ONLY 
BE CONDUCTED AFTER THE APPLICATION IS COMPLETE AND THE OFFICER INTERVIEW BOARD 
HAS SUBMITTED THEIR APPRAISALS.  THE FULL PICTURE OF AN APPLICANT'S ACADEMIC 
AND OFFICER POTENTIAL CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED BY REVIEWING THE SAT/ACT SCORES, 
HIGH SCHOOL/COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS, AND A COMPLETED APPLICATION PACKAGE.
    D.  THE CO'S ENDORSEMENT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY THE RANKING OF 
THE INDIVIDUAL AMONG HIS/HER PEERS.  THE ENDORSEMENT SHOULD CONTAIN SPECIFICS 
ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL'S ACADEMIC POTENTIAL, COMMITMENT, LEADERSHIP, AND 
POTENTIAL AS A NAVAL OFFICER.  CO COMMENTS SHOULD SPECIFY THE PRIMARY OPTION 
TO WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS APPLYING AND ADDRESS HOW THE INDIVIDUAL MEETS 
QUALIFICATIONS FOR THAT OPTION.  
    E.  AN INTERVIEW BOARD AND NOMINATION REVIEW BOARD SHALL BE CONDUCTED PER 
REF A.  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT OFFICERS OF THE APPLICANT'S DESIGNATOR CHOICE, 
IF AVAILABLE, BE ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERVIEW/NOMINATION REVIEW BOARD 
TO ASSESS THE APPLICANT FOR THEIR COMMUNITY.  FOR JUNIOR SAILORS WITH ONLY 
SCHOOLHOUSE EVALUATIONS, THE CO MUST ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN HIS OR HER 
ENDORSEMENT.  OFFICER APPRAISALS PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT ON THE APPLICANT.  
APPRAISAL FORMS SHOULD BE TYPED IN 10 OR 12 POINT FONT.
    F.  THE APPLICANT'S PERSONAL STATEMENT SHOULD ADDRESS WHY THE SAILOR WANTS 
TO BECOME AN OFFICER, HOW THE SAILOR'S SELECTION WOULD IMPROVE THE NAVY, AND 
WHY THE SAILOR IS APPLYING FOR A SPECIFIC OPTION.  SAILORS MUST ALSO ADDRESS 
ANY HARDSHIPS OR UNIQUE EXPERIENCES THAT SHAPED THEIR CHARACTER.  JUNIOR 
SAILORS SHOULD PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCES.  HIGH SCHOOL 
TRANSCRIPTS RARELY PROVIDE IN-DEPTH INFORMATION ON INVOLVEMENT IN SPORTS, 
CLUBS, VOLUNTEER WORK, ETC.  ADDITIONALLY, APPLICANTS SHOULD EXPLAIN ANY 
MITIGATING ISSUES THE BOARD NEEDS TO CONSIDER (I.E., POOR HIGH SCHOOL OR 
COLLEGE GRADES AND UNEXPLAINED GAPS).
    G.  THE APPLICATION IS A REFLECTION OF THE APPLICANT.  APPLICANTS MUST 
REVIEW THEIR PACKAGES IN THEIR ENTIRETY BEFORE SUBMITTING.  CHECK FOR 
MISSPELLED WORDS AND GRAMMAR ISSUES AND ENSURE ALL TRANSCRIPTS ARE ENCLOSED.  
A MINIMUM SCORE OF GOOD ON THE LATEST PFA AND QUALIFYING SAT/ACT SCORES ARE 
REQUIRED.  INCLUDE ANY ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS, QUALIFICATIONS, OR OTHER 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS A PART OF THE PACKAGE.  

7.  THE NAVY NEEDS INNOVATIVE AND BOLD MEN AND WOMEN TO LEAD, THINK 
CREATIVELY, CHALLENGE ASSUMPTIONS, AND TAKE WELL-CALCULATED RISKS.  TODAY'S 
NAVY IS COMPOSED OF MEN AND WOMEN REPRESENTING DOZENS OF DIFFERENT ETHNIC 
GROUPS AND LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS.  THE NAVY'S ABILITY TO 
MEET LEADERSHIP CHALLENGES RELIES ON HAVING LEADERS FROM OUR ENTIRE NAVY WHO 
REFLECT OUR VERY BEST.

8.  APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE MAILED TO:
      COMMANDER
      NAVAL SERVICE TRAINING COMMAND (OD2/STA-21)
