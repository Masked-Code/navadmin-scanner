SUBJ/OBSERVANCE OF ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH 2011// 

RMKS/1.  WE WILL OBSERVE ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH DURING THE 
MONTH OF MAY.  THE NATIONAL THEME FOR THIS YEAR IS "DIVERSITY, LEADERSHIP, 
EMPOWERMENT, AND BEYOND."

2.  ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH ORIGINATED IN JUNE 1977, WHEN 
PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER SIGNED A JOINT RESOLUTION DESIGNATING THE FIRST 10 DAYS 
OF MAY AS ASIAN PACIFIC HERITAGE WEEK.  TWELVE YEARS LATER, PRESIDENT GEORGE 
H. W. BUSH EXTENDED THE WEEK TO A MONTH-LONG CELEBRATION, AND IN 1992, MAY WAS 
OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED BY LAW AS ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH.  THE 
MONTH OF MAY WAS CHOSEN TO COMMEMORATE THE IMMIGRATION OF THE FIRST JAPANESE 
TO THE UNITED STATES IN MAY 1843 AND TO MARK THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMPLETION 
OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD IN MAY 1869, A SYSTEM WHICH WAS PREDOMINANTLY 
BUILT BY CHINESE IMMIGRANTS.

3.  TODAY, MORE THAN 50,000 MEMBERS OF ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE 
COMPRISE OUR NAVY TOTAL FORCE, INCLUDING NINE FLAG OFFICERS AND 11 MEMBERS OF 
THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE SERVICE.  THIS YEAR'S THEME CELEBRATES THE WEALTH OF 
IDEAS, TRADITIONS, AND COMMITMENT THAT ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICANS CONTRIBUTE TO 
OUR NAVY.  EXAMPLES OF NOTABLE ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICANS IN OUR NAVY, PAST AND 
PRESENT, INCLUDE:

ASIAN AMERICANS TO ENLIST IN THE U.S. NAVY.

CALIFORNIA, WHO IN 1942 BECAME THE FIRST KOREAN AMERICAN WOMAN IN THE U.S.

C.  REAR ADMIRAL GORDON PAI'EA CHUNG-HOON, OF CHINESE AND HAWAIIAN HERITAGE,
