RMKS/1.  The Navy is pleased to announce the selection of the following 
Sailors for training and assignment as the first enlisted female submariners.  
Their selection is the result of outstanding professional performance, and 
willingness to contribute to setting this new course for women in the Navy. 
These selections are a key milestone in the continued integration of women 
into the Submarine Force.  The interest in this program was strong, and 
selection was competitive.  This cohort represents the first step in the 
integration of enlisted women onboard submarines.  These Sailors will be 
assigned to the first 2 of 18 submarine crews included in the initial 
integration plan.

2.  Congratulations to the following Sailors who were selected to be assigned 
to USS MICHIGAN:

3.  Selectees must have a submarine duty physical completed in accordance 
with reference (c) and approved by an Undersea Medical Officer (UMO) within 
30 days of the DTG of this message.  The Report of Medical History (DD Form 
2807-1) and Report of Medical Examination (DD Form 2808) may be completed by 
any Department of Defense privileged provider (MD,DO,PA,NP); however, a UMO 
is required to bottom line the overall submarine duty physical on DD Form 
2808 (Block 84.a).  UMOs are located at all submarine homeport medical 
departments and the contact numbers and medical screening information is 
posted as a link on the website listed below.  For those selectees not in 
proximity to submarine homeports, contact the COMSUBLANT/COMSUBPAC Force IDC 
for further guidance on completing a submarine duty physical.
    a.  For questions regarding medical fitness for submarine duty: 
COMSUBLANT Force IDC (Norfolk, VA):  757-836-1351/1354. COMSUBPAC Force IDC 
(Pearl Harbor, HI):  808-473-1479/5788.
    b.  For further details and additional UMO contact information go to 
http://www.npc.navy.mil/bupers-npc/enlisted/community/submarine/
Pages/EnlistedWomeninSubmarines.aspx

4.  PERS 403 will contact selectees within the next 30 days to arrange for 
transfer to Basic Enlisted Submarine School to begin the submarine training 
pipeline.  Depending on the rating for which they were selected, Sailors can 
expect to detach from their current commands from as early as Fall 2015 to as 
late as Spring 2016.

5.  Congratulations to the following Sailors also selected, who may be 
contacted to convert to submarines if a primary selectee is unable to report 
as assigned:

6.  Sailors listed in paragraph 5 above may be called upon within 90 days to 
fill an assignment on USS MICHIGAN if a primary selectee does not pass their 
submarine physical or is otherwise determined to be ineligible for assignment 
onboard submarines.

7.  Sailors listed in paragraph 5 above will be automatically submitted and 
reviewed for selection during the next conversion selection window unless the 
Sailor or the command desires to remove the package from the next selection 
round.  These Sailors are encouraged to update their application package to 
reflect additional performance, advancement, or experience.  Contact the 
submarine non-nuclear ECM office for more information on how to remove a 
package from consideration or to update an existing application:  LT Greg
Mosley, 901-874-2081; STSCS(SS) Joseph Hanley, 901-874-4367; YNC(SS)
Aaron Norton, 901-874-2819.

8.  The next window for applications will open in July 2015 and will be 
announced via a separate NAVADMIN.

9.  The selections for nuclear-trained personnel will be made in Spring 2016.  
Each MICHIGAN crew will have 2 previous junior staff instructors (JSI) (any 
nuclear rating) and 4 prototype graduates (one from each nuclear rating).  
These Sailors will transfer to the submarine from the nuclear power training 
units (NPTU) in late 2016 after the selections are made.  Female JSIs or 
Sailors in initial training interested in volunteering for submarine duty 
should inform their chain of command.  In early 2016, the chain of command at 
each NPTU will develop an application package on each submarine volunteer 
that will aid in the selections.
