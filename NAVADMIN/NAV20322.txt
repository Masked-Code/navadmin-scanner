RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN reinforces the Fleet Cyber Command (FLTCYBERCOM) 
direction, outlined in references A-C, to upgrade Navy and Marine Corps 
Intranet (NMCI) workstations to Windows 10 Version 1909 (v1909).  As of 
2300z,11 December, all workstations (NIPR and SIPR) that were not upgraded to 
v1909 and have been offline for more than 90 days will be placed in 
quarantine preventing access to network resources.  These assets will remain 
in quarantine until successfully upgraded to v1909.  This enforcement does 
not apply to embarkable workstations.

2.  For workstations that have been offline for more than 90 days, commands 
are required to immediately connect, turn on, and login allowing automatic 
placement into quarantine for updating.  Once the v1909 upgrade is complete, 
the workstations automatically return to the network and are available for 
use.

3.  NMCI workstations identified as no longer required must be returned by 
the Contract Technical Representative (CTR) to prevent the Navy from funding 
assets no longer in active use.

5.  Released by VADM Jeffrey E. Trussler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations 
for Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
