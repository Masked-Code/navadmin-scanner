SUBJ/MILITARY FAMILY APPRECIATION MONTH//

RMKS/1.  THIS NOVEMBER WE TAKE THE TIME TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO 
OUR MILITARY FAMILIES FOR THEIR UNWAVERING SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.  
NATIONAL MILITARY FAMILY APPRECIATION MONTH IS A TIME TO THANK AND 
RECOGNIZE OUR LOVED ONES FOR THEIR MANY PERSONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR 
NAVY AND NATION.  WITHOUT THEIR EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE AND SUPPORT , WE 
COULD NOT EXECUTE THE MISSIONS EXPECTED OF US.

ACROSS THE WORLD'S OCEANS, INCLUDING MORE THAN 14,000 SAILORS ON THE 
GROUND IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  THE CONTINUED COMMITMENT OF OUR FAMILIES 
MAKES OUR SUCCESS POSSIBLE AND ALLOWS US TO MAINTAIN THE MOST POWERFUL 
NAVY IN THE WORLD.

FAMILIES WHO STAND PROUDLY BY US, AT HOME AND ABROAD.
