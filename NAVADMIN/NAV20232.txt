    c.  References (a) and (b) limit career retention bonus payments to

4.  Program Eligibility 
    a.  LT EOD ORB: 
        (1) Unrestricted Line (URL) officers (Designator 1140) that qualified 
both EOD warfare officer and EOD department head, awarded the additional 
qualification designators (AQD) of KG5 and KG0. 
        (2) Completed 7 years of commissioned service (for the 4-year bonus) 
or 8 years of commissioned service (for the 3-year bonus). 
        (3) Completed any service commitment incurred through original 
commissioning. 
        (4) Medically and physically qualified for assignment to sea duty. 
    b.  LCDR EOD ORB: 
        (1) URL officers (Designator 1140) that qualified EOD warfare officer 
and EOD department head, awarded the AQDs of KG5 and KG0. 
        (2) Completed 12 years of commissioned service. 
        (3) Medically and physically qualified for assignment to sea duty. 
    c.  Career Intermission Program (CIP).  An Officer participating in CIP 
will be ineligible to receive ORB payments during the intermission 
period.  Payments will resume upon return to service and in line with the 
payment structure of the ORB agreement. 
 
5.  Program Execution 
    a.  The EOD Warfare Officer Community Manager (BUPERS-311E) is assigned 
as the Program Manager and is delegated the authority to administer the EOD 
ORB Program in line with applicable laws, DoD directives and instructions and 
this NAVADMIN. 
    b.  BUPERS-311E will receive applications submitted in the format 
referenced in paragraph 7 and is delegated the authority to: 
        (1) Evaluate the eligibility of EOD officers applying for the EOD 
ORB. 
        (2) Accept agreements to remain on Active Duty for the stated period 
in exchange for an EOD ORB. 
        (3) Administer ORB payments. 
    c.  All applications require written endorsement from the commanding 
officer of the applicant. 
    d.  Service Members will receive their initial bonus amount upon 
agreement acceptance and then in annual anniversary payments through the term 
of the agreement. 
    e.  Upon acceptance of an agreement by the program manager, the amount of 
the bonus becomes fixed and the officer will incur a firm service obligation. 
    f.  ORB requests for personnel who are being processed for officer 
designation removal or restoration will be held in abeyance, pending final 
resolution of the action in question. 
    g.  Annual LT ORB contract quotas will be based on LCDR requirements for 
the EOD officer community and special and incentive pay funding 
controls.  Annual LCDR ORB contract quotas will be based on CDR requirements 
for the EOD officer community, as well as special and incentive pay funding 
controls.  If more officers apply than available funded contracts, the 
program manager and EOD community leadership will determine the approval 
criteria. 
    h.  All commanding officers shall encourage qualified officers to submit 
applications for EOD ORB and must endorse all requests in writing.  Commands 
must ensure applications are accurate and verify applicants meet the 
eligibility requirements, including no pending actions which may render an 
applicant ineligible for the EOD ORB.  Application delays increase the 
likelihood that the community quotas will be met before an application is 
received. 
    i.  Officers under an ORB agreement are not eligible to apply for the 
Junior Permanent Military Professor (JPMP) Program, or any redesignation 
program that results in a designator change to any designator other than 
1140.  An officer under an ORB agreement may submit an application for 
JPMP or any redesignation programs once the date of application is within 12 
months of the final day of bonus obligation. 
 
6.  Payment Structure 
    a.  LT EOD ORB: 
        (1) 4-year Agreement.  Officers who commit to 4 years of additional 
active duty service will receive $20,000 per year paid in equal installments 
over the course of the agreement. This contract cannot extend an officer past 
11 years of commissioned service (YCS-11). 
        (2) 3-year Agreement.  Officers who commit to 3 years of additional 
active duty service will receive $15,000 per year, paid in equal installments 
over the course of the agreement.  This contract cannot extend an officer 
past YCS-11. 
    b.  LCDR EOD ORB: 
        (1) 3-year Agreement.  Officers who commit to 3 years of additional 
active duty service will receive $22,000 upon their twelfth anniversary of 
commissioning and $12,000 per year thereafter over the course of the 
agreement. 
    c.  EOD ORB agreement obligations will run consecutively in line with 
reference (b). 
 
7.  Application Process 
    a.  Officers within 1 year of eligibility may apply for the EOD ORB via 
their commanding officer.  Officers must submit a copy of the signed original 
contract and commanding officer endorsement by email to the BUPERS-311E. 
    b.  General Notes: 
        (1) Sample application format for EOD ORB can be found on the EOD OCM

        (2) Applications will be held until payment eligibility date. 
        (3) Applications will be binding upon the date of approval. 
        (4) Applications received in the incorrect format or not meeting 
eligibility requirements defined in this NAVADMIN will be rejected. 
 
8.  Recoupment and Repayment Policy 
    a.  EOD ORB payments will be stopped for officers who become ineligible 
for this incentive or fail to complete the full period of additional 
obligated service.  Situations requiring recoupment are in line with 
reference (a) section 373, reference (b) and reference (d). 
    b.  If an officer becomes ineligible for EOD ORB for any of the reasons 
below, payments will stop, but recoupment of payments already received will 
not be required: 
        (1)  Disability, injury or illness not the result of misconduct or 
willful neglect, or not incurred during a period of unauthorized absence. 
        (2)  Separation from the naval service by operation of laws or 
regulations independent of misconduct. 
        (3)  Death (See subparagraph c below). 
        (4)  Where the Secretary of the Navy determines repayment would be 
against equity and good conscience or would be contrary to the best interests 
of the United States. 
    c.  For officers who die while serving under an EOD ORB service 
agreement, the remaining EOD ORB balance will be paid as a lump sum as part 
of the settlement of the final military pay account for the officer.  If 
death is determined to be the result of misconduct by the member, termination 
of future payments and recoupment of unearned portions of the bonus, as 
applicable, will be made in line with procedures established for Service 
Members whose inability to complete a contracted period of service is 
voluntary or the result of misconduct. 
 
9.  Additional guidance, information and updates regarding the EOD ORB are 
available at the BUPERS Website.
