RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces updates to the High Year Tenure
(HYT) policy of the Navy by amending HYT length of service (LOS) gates.  
Revisions to reference (a) are forthcoming and will be published at a later 
date.  All other HYT policy contained in reference (a) remains in effect.

2.  The HYT policy of the Navy establishes LOS gates by paygrade.
It is a vital and effective force management tool used to appropriately size 
and shape the enlisted force and promote continuous advancement opportunity.  
Changes to Navy HYT policy are directly linked to fleet readiness.  As the 
Navy works to maintain fleet fit/fill, we have closely examined how we can 
expand retention of talented and experienced Sailors.

3.  Effective 1 August 2017, HYT policy is amended to reflect new LOS gates 
for pay grades E4 through E6 for Active Component (AC) and Full Time Support 
(FTS) Sailors.  Effective 1 August 2017, HYT LOS gates are as follows:
E4 (AC and FTS)          10 years (vice 8 years)
E5 (AC and FTS)          16 years (vice 14 years)
E6 (AC and FTS)          22 years (vice 20 years)

4.  Eligibility guidelines.  For those personnel who have been planning to 
separate or transition to the Fleet Reserve under current HYT LOS, and who 
will be subject to the new HYT LOS gates effective 1 August 2017, the 
following guidelines are provided:
    a.  AC and FTS members who currently have approved separation or Fleet 
Reserve dates on or after 1 August 2017 and before
1 January 2018 must decide no later than 31 July 2017 whether to cancel their 
Fleet Reserve or HYT separation orders and remain on active duty or execute 
their orders as originally planned.
        (1)  In line with reference (b), members with approved Fleet Reserve 
dates on or after 1 August 2017 who desire to remain on active duty must 
first submit cancellation requests no later than 31 July 2017 to Commander, 
Navy Personnel Command (COMNAVPERSCOM) Enlisted Retirements Office (PERS-836) 
at the following e-mail
address:  enlisted_active_duty_retirements(at)navy.mil.  Once received, 
approval of Fleet Reserve cancellation requests serves as authority to cancel 
previously issued retirement orders, which are issued by the local supporting 
personnel office, and serves as authority for members to obligate additional 
service to reach the new HYT date.  PERS-836 will forward all approved 
cancellation requests to COMNAVPERSCOM, Enlisted Assignment Division (PERS-
40), and to Deputy Chief of Naval Operations Nuclear Program Manager (OPNAV 
(N133)), for all nuclear-trained AC and FTS members.
        (2)  E4 and E5 personnel with approved HYT Separation dates on or 
after 1 August 2017 must request permission no later than
31 July 2017 to reenlist or extend to their new HYT date from Bureau of Naval 
Personnel (BUPERS) Enlisted Community Management (BUPERS-
32) for all non-nuclear-trained AC and FTS members and OPNAV (N133) for all 
nuclear-trained AC and FTS members.  BUPERS-32 and OPNAV
(N133) will forward approved reenlistment requests to PERS-40.
    b.  Members in receipt of either separation or Fleet Reserve orders who 
have executed any portion of those orders, to include movement of household 
goods or dependents, shall include this information in their request to PERS-
836 for Fleet Reserve and BUPERS-32/OPNAV (N133) for separation to be 
considered for approval on a case-by-case basis.

5.  Navy-Wide Advancement Exams (NWAE)
    a.  E4 and E5 personnel affected by this change to HYT LOS gates who 
desire to stay Navy must maintain advancement eligibility as outlined in 
reference (c) to participate in the September 2017 NWAE, cycle 236 reference 
(d).
    b.  E6 members affected by this change to HYT LOS gates who desire to 
stay Navy must maintain advancement eligibility as outlined in reference (c) 
to participate in the January 2018 NWAE, cycle 238 E7 exam.

6. Detailing Process
    a.  Members affected by this change to HYT LOS gates who desire to stay 
Navy, who are currently on sea duty (type 2, 3, and 4), and have not 
completed their prescribed tour as a result of the previous HYT policy will 
have their projected rotation date (PRD) extended at their present duty 
station to meet their normal tour length, or until their new HYT date, 
whichever is closest.
    b.  Members who desire to stay Navy and are currently assigned to shore 
duty (type 1 and 6) may be assigned to sea duty or other higher priority 
billets based on needs of the Navy and will have their PRDs established to 
match their new HYT date.
    c.  Members who desire to stay Navy and who are not in receipt of 
separation/retirement orders but are within 7 months of their newly 
established PRD must contact their detailer who can make a Career Management 
System Interactive (CMS-ID) application for them in the next CMS-ID cycle.
    d.  Members who desire to stay Navy and who are in their normal
7-9 month negotiation window should submit an application via CMS-ID.  Those 
affected Sailors beyond 9 months from their newly established PRD will follow 
the normal detailing processes.

7.  Involuntary Separation Pay (ISP)
    a.  Members with approved HYT separation dates prior to
1 January 2018 who no later than 31 July 2017 elect to execute their HYT 
Separation orders will remain eligible for ISP.
    b.  Members with approved HYT separation dates on or after
1 January 2018 who elect to separate at current expiration of active 
obligated service will be considered as separating under voluntary conditions 
and will not be eligible for ISP.

8.  Nuclear Trained Sailors.  Each nuclear-trained sailor at the E6 paygrade 
desiring to extend their active service past 20 years must have their request 
approved by OPNAV (N133).

9.  Points of contact.  For HYT policy related questions, commands and
