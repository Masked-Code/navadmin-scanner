OPTION//

NARR/REF A IS PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION 147, THE BACCALAUREATE DEGREE COMPLETION 
PROGRAM.   
REF B IS NAVADMIN 066/22, BACCALAUREATE DEGREE COMPLETION PROGRAM.   
REF C IS NAVMED P-117, MANUAL OF THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN promulgates reference (a), supplements reference (b), 
and announces changes to the Baccalaureate Degree Completion Program (BDCP) 
to add information warfare (IW) options.

2.  Along with the unrestricted line (URL) communities listed in references 
(a) and (b), the BDCP has now been expanded to include IW communities, 
specifically cryptologic warfare (CW), cyber warfare engineer (CWE), 
intelligence (Intel), information professional (IP), and oceanography 
(OCEANO).

3.  BDCP boards will continue to convene in conjunction with URL and IW 
professional recommendation boards to select highly qualified applicants to 
attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) during the fiscal year 2023 and beyond 
shipping years.

4.  Specific IW BDCP academic requirements are outlined below:
    a.  CW.  Major fields of study directly related to science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are most strongly preferred but not 
required.
    b.  CWE.  Degrees in computer science and computer engineering are 
strongly preferred, other technical majors will be considered on a case-by-
case basis, including but not limited to cyber operations, mathematics, 
information systems, software engineering and other computer-related 
disciplines.
    c.  INTEL.  Major fields of study in international relations with a 
regional focus (e.g., Middle East or Asian studies), political science, 
history, or STEM are strongly preferred but not required.
    d.  IP.  Major fields of study directly related to information systems, 
cybersecurity, computer science, computer engineering, electrical 
engineering, operations research, applied statistics, or other STEM fields 
are preferred but not required.
    e.  OCEANO.  Major fields of study directly related to science, 
meteorology, oceanography, mathematics, physics, and engineering are most 
strongly preferred but not required.

5.  BDCP applicants must meet pre-commissioning or accession physical 
standards in line with reference (c), as well as any additional requirements 
(specifically security clearance eligibility requirements for the IW 
communities) imposed by the program authorization for the specific designator 
for which they have applied.

6.  Applicants may only request consideration for one community in their 
application.  Interested CWE candidates should contact the CWE Officer 
Community Management (OCM) to understand the unique pre- requisite screening 
for consideration for CWE.

7.  All selectees, with the exception of CWE, will complete OCS in Newport, 
RI.  CWE selectees will attend Officer Development School
(ODS) instead of OCS.  If a selectee fails to successfully complete OCS or 
ODS for any reason other than injury, the selectee will be required to serve 
the remainder of their enlisted contract.

8.  Applicants interested in applying for BDCP should refer to references (a) 
and (b) for additional program details.
Additionally, if additional questions remain, including board convening dates 
and deadlines, applicants should contact their local Navy officer recruiter 
or command career counselor (if the interested member is in the Navy 
Reserve).  Additionally, questions may be referred to the BDCP Program 
Manager:  LT Megan Wilson, Branch Head, General Officer Accessions (CNRC 
N311) at (901) 874-
9419 or via e-mail at megan.c.wilson.mil(at)us.navy.mil.  Questions 
concerning BDCP IWC options may be referred to the IWC OCM (BUPERS
317) at (901) 874-3123 or via e-mail at BUPERS 31_IWC_FCT(at)navy.mil.

9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or cancelled, 
whichever occurs first.
