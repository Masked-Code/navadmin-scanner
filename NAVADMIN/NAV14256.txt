RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides Navy-specific direction to all owners of U.S. 
Navy SIPRNet websites and ashore web-accessible applications.

2.  Background.  References (a) and (b) required 100 percent issuance of 
National Security Systems (NSS) PKI Tokens (hereafter referred to as SIPRNet 
tokens) to all SIPRNet users and PK-enablement of all Navy-owned, operated or 
controlled SIPRNet-connected networks, web servers and applications in 
accordance with references (c) and (d), while maintaining the ability for 
temporary exception users to access SIPRNet resources using username and 
password.  Reference (b) required web servers and applications to be PK-
enabled no later than 30 June 2013.  Department of the Navy, Deputy Chief 
Information Officer (Navy) (DDCIO (N)) extended this date to allow afloat 
users time to obtain their card readers, middleware and tokens.  Non-Navy 
website and application owners started implementation of the DoD Public Key 
Enablement mandate on 15 July 2014.  Navy users without tokens may be unable 
to access non-Navy critical Public Key enabled websites and application 
effective immediately.

3.  Action
a.  No later than 1 January 2015, Navy website and application owners 
shall require hardware PKI technology (Credential Strength H) to 
authenticate user identity, hereafter known as *PK Enforcement* on all 
websites and applications regardless of data sensitivity level.  
Username and password access will be maintained as secondary method to 
facilitate access by temporary exception users.  Website and 
application owners unable to meet the 1 January 2015 deadline may 
request a waiver/exception from DDCIO (N).  DDCIO (N) will not grant 
waiver/exceptions past 31 March 2015, unless there is no technical 
solution available for a website or application, in which case the 
waiver/exception request will provide a plan of actions and milestones 
(POA&M) with the minimum amount of time required to procure hardware, 
software and services required to meet the mandate.

b.  Website and application owners requiring waivers/exceptions shall 
submit the waiver/exception request, using the DDCIO(N) provided 
template, signed by the first Flag Officer/Senior Executive Service 
member in their chain of command directly to DDCIO (N) point of contact 
no later than 1 December 2014.  Waiver/exception requests must provide 
detailed reasons explaining why compliance cannot be attained within 
the directed timeframe and include any required mitigation plans.  
Include a POA&M for achieving website and application PK enablement 
during the extension period.  Waiver /exception templates can be 
downloaded from: ttps://infosec.navy.mil/PKI/siprpolicy.jsp.

4.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.
