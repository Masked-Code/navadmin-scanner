RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces an upcoming change to reference (a) 
directing reporting seniors to use specific officer summary groups (OSGs) for 
active component (AC) limited duty officers (LDO) and chief warrant officers 
(CWO).  The modification aligns the 6XXX and 7XXX designators into specific 
categories and enables a more focused community capability for the Navy while 
preserving the unique knowledge, skills, and technical abilities of the 
individual competitive categories.  Changes to OSGs apply to AC LDO and CWO 
only.  Reserve Component LDOs and CWOs will continue to use current summary 
groups LDO Line (61XX/62XX/63XX/64XX), LDO Staff (65XX), and CWO (7XXX).  
These changes support the LDO/CWO Officer Sustainability Initiative (OSI) 
with a goal to holistically review the LDO/CWO communities ensuring the force 
structure of both remains balanced.  As the OSI effort matures, promotion 
boards will begin considering LDO and CWOs for promotion in new competitive 
categories which mirror the revised OSGs for the FY-21 promotion plan.  This
NAVADMIN will remain in effect until the update of reference (a).

2.  Fitness reports ending on 1 October 2017 or later (block 15), reporting 
seniors must:
    a.  Rank LDO ensign through captain by OSG as follows:  surface (61XX), 
submarine/nuclear (62XX), aviation (63XX), general line/staff (641X, 643X, 
647X, 648X, 649X, 653X and 655X), supply (651X) and information warfare 
(68XX).
    b.  Rank CWO2 through CWO5 by OSG as follows:  surface (71XX), 
submarine/nuclear (72XX/740X), aviation (73XX), information warfare (78XX), 
and general line/staff (741X, 748X, 749X, 751X, 752X and 753X).

3.  This change applies for fitness report purposes only.  LDOs and CWOs will 
retain their current designators and continue to compete for statutory 
promotion within current competitive categories.

4.  Amplifying guidance for reporting seniors is provided as follows:
    a.  Continue adherence to upper limits on early promote and must promote 
recommendations in line with reference (a).
    b.  Existing special billet subcategories will remain in effect.
    c.  Table 1-3 of reference (a) defines other characteristics used in 
determining OSGs.
    d.  The use of amplifying fitness report verbiage and soft breakouts by 
individual community are strongly encouraged.  All efforts should be made to 
continue to document officers displaying sustained superior performance.

5.  For additional information, contact the Navy Personnel Command Customer 
Service Center at 1-866-U-ASK-NPC, or via e-mail at uasknpc(at)navy.mil.

6.  File this NAVADMIN with reference (a).
