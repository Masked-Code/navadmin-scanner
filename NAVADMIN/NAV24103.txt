An officer who chooses to decline promotion must submit the 
declination in writing to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806) within thirty

exercise of a delay, the officer shall be notified in writing before 
the effective date of the promotion and not be tendered the 
promoting appointment.  The delay authority will immediately forward 
the notification of delay with supporting documentation to 
COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-83), copy to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806). 
 
4.  COs are reminded of their responsibility to ensure the officers 
they are promoting are mentally, physically, morally and 
professionally qualified in accordance with section 14311 of title 
10, U.S. Code.  Per reference (a), officers are ineligible for 
promotion if they have failed the most recent Physical Fitness 
Assessment.  COs shall verify the promoting officer's information in 
the Physical Readiness Information Management System to ensure 
compliance with reference (a) and delay the officers promotion in 
accordance with paragraph three of this NAVADMIN, if required. 
 
5.  Prepare a Delivery of Permanent Appointment (NAVPERS FORM
