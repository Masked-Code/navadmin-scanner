SUBJ/MANDATORY AFLOAT ISSUANCE OF SIPRNET TOKENS//

NARR/Ref A is Department of Defense Chief Information Officer memo, 
Department of Defense Secure Internet Protocol Router Network Public Key 
Infrastructure Cryptographic Logon and Public Key Enablement of Secure 
Internet Protocol Router Network Applications and Web Servers.  Ref B is 
NAVADMIN 084/12, Public Key Enablement of Navy Secret Internet Protocol 
Router Network.  Ref C is PMW-160 Networks Fleet Advisory Message 0170 which 
addresses installation and configuration of the middleware smart card reader 
to allow the use of secure internet protocol router network tokens.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides Navy-specific direction to all afloat 
commands regarding secure internet protocol router network (SIPRnet) token 
issuance per ref A.  All afloat commands shall issue SIPRnet tokens to 100 
percent of SIPRnet users to allow them to access public key (PK) enabled 
websites and applications by 1 July 2014.

2.  Background.  Ref A requires 100 percent of SIPRnet users to have the 
ability to use tokens to access websites and applications.  Without these 
tokens, SIPRnet users will soon be unable to access critical PK enabled 
websites required for daily operations.  Upon installation of card readers 
and middleware, PK authentication is available on afloat workstations.  The 
installation to allow PK authentication on websites is independent of network 
changes required to allow using public key infrastructure (PKI) to gain 
access to the network via cryptographic log on (CLO).  The second phase of 
the SIPR PKI afloat implementation will require CLO.

3.  Action

    a. Subject to forthcoming guidance from Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces 
Command (COMUSFLTFORCOM) and Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMUSPACFLT), 
afloat commands will order tokens and card readers and issue tokens to 100 
percent of SIPRnet users by 1 July 2014.  The following provides a notional 
plan of action for token issuance per refs B and C:

        (1) Assign three trusted agents (TA).
        (2) Provide training to TAs and complete designation paperwork.
        (3) Provide names of TAs to Ms. Linda Kee via e-mail:  
linda.kee(at)navy.mil.
        (4) Order tokens from Regional Local Registration Authority (LRA).  
LRA information is available at: 
https://infosec.navy.mil/PKI/nssregionallras.pdf.
        (5) PK-enable workstations by installing 90-meter middleware and 
connecting card readers.
        (6) Issue tokens to all users and report statistics as COMUSFLTFORCOM 
and COMUSPACFLT.
        (7) The token issuance guide is available at: 
https://infosec.navy.mil/PKI/fleet_nss_pki_20121107.pdf

    b. COMUSFLTFORCOM and COMUSPACFLT shall report status of afloat token 
issuance to Commander, Naval Network Warfare Command on the first and third 
Friday of each month until compliant with this message.

4.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded. 

5.  Released by Vice Admiral Ted N. Branch, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations 
for Information Dominance (OPNAV N2N6).//
