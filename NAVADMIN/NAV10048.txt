GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. REF A ANNOUNCED THE NEW DON SAFETY VISION AND 
IMPLEMENTING GUIDANCE FOR COMMANDS AND TASKED THE NAVY EXECUTIVE SAFETY 
BOARD (NESB) WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE NAVY'S 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DON SAFETY VISION AND TRACK METRICS CHOSEN TO 
MEASURE SUCCESS.  REF B ENSURES COMMAND AWARENESS OF THE DON SAFETY 
VISION AND REITERATES SECNAV'S SUPPORT FOR THE CULTURAL PHILOSOPHY THE 
SAFETY VISION REPRESENTS. REF C REITERATED SECNAV SUPPORT FOR THE DON 
SAFETY VISION AND THE 75% MISHAP REDUCTION GOALS. THIS MSG PROVIDES 
ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FOR ALL COMMANDS TO ENSURE THE NESB RECEIVES THE 
NECESSARY INFORMATION TO EFFECTIVELY MONITOR THE NAVY'S IMPLEMENTATION 
OF THE DON SAFETY VISION. DURING REF D NESB MEMBERS APPROVED RELEASE OF 
THIS MSG WITH THE RECOMMENDATION TO CHANGE THE TIMELINE TO CALENDAR 
YEAR.
2. PER REFS E AND F, NAVY COMMANDS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AN ANNUAL 
SELF-ASSESSMENT OF THEIR SAFETY PROGRAM.  COMMAND SELF-ASSESSMENTS, AS 
OUTLINED IN REF A, WILL FACILITATE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IN SAFETY 
PERFORMANCE BY MANAGING HAZARDS, MITIGATING RISK AND IMPLEMENTING 
ACTIONS TO REDUCE MISHAPS.  THE NESB WILL LEVERAGE COMMAND/UNIT SELF-
ASSESSMENTS TO FULFILL ITS DON SAFETY VISION OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY.  
3. ACTION. 
A. THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC GUIDANCE PERTAINS TO DON SAFETY VISION:
(1)COMMANDS/UNITS SHALL IMPLEMENT THE DON SAFETY VISION OUTLINED IN REF 
A, INCORPORATE THE DON SAFETY VISION INTO THEIR ANNUAL SAFETY SELF-
ASSESSMENT PROCESS, AND COMPLETE THEIR SELF-ASSESSMENT BY 31 DEC OF 
EACH CALENDAR YEAR BEGINNING WITH CALENDAR YEAR 2010. COMMANDS SHALL 
FORMULATE IMPROVEMENT PLANS AS PART OF THE SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND 
SHALL TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPS TO CORRECT HAZARDS AND DEFICIENCIES WHEN 
DISCOVERED. UNITS SHALL ALSO INVESTIGATE AND SUBMIT HAZARD REPORTS ON 
SIGNIFICANT HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT 
OTHER COMMANDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHAPTER 4 OF REF G. ADDITIONALLY, THE 
FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS REQUIRED TO BE ROLLED UP AT EACH COMMAND/UNIT 
LEVEL IN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND UP TO THE ECHELON III COMMANDER: TOP FIVE 
AREAS OF CONCERN, PROGRAM DEFICIENCIES, AND WEAKNESSES, SUCCESSES, AND 
ROADBLOCKS TO SUCCESSFUL MISHAP PREVENTION EFFORTS.  
(2)ECHELON III COMMANDS SHALL REVIEW SUBORDINATE SUBMISSIONS AND 
FORWARD THEIR CONSOLIDATED TOP FIVE AREAS OF CONCERN, PROGRAM 
DEFICIENCIES, AND WEAKNESSES, SUCCESSES AND ROADBLOCKS TO SUCCESSFUL 
MISHAP PREVENTION EFFORTS TO THEIR ECHELON II NO LATER THAN 1 MAR OF 
EACH CALENDAR YEAR. 
(3)ECHELON II COMMANDS SHALL CONSOLIDATE INFORMATION RECEIVED AND 
FORWARD SUBMISSIONS TO THE EXECUTIVE SAFETY COMMITTEE (ESC) NO LATER 
THAN 1 MAY OF EACH YEAR.
(4)THE ESC SHALL EVALUATE CONSOLIDATED SELF-ASSESSMENT FINDINGS AND 
PREPARE A WRITTEN REPORT AND BRIEF FOR THE NEXT SCHEDULED NESB FOCUSING 
ON ACTIONABLE INFORMATION GAINED FROM SAFETY SELF-ASSESSMENTS FINDINGS 
AND RECOMMEND POLICY CHANGES.  
B. THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC GUIDANCE PERTAINS TO THE SECDEF 2012 MISHAP 
REDUCTION GOALS; ALL COMMANDS SHALL:
(1)WORK TO MEET THE SECDEF 2012 MISHAP REDUCTION GOALS LISTED IN REF H.  
THESE GOALS ESTABLISHED A 75% MISHAP REDUCTION BASED ON THE 2002 
BASELINE YEAR FOR MILITARY AND CIVILIAN INJURIES, PRIVATE MOTOR VEHICLE 
FATALITIES AND AVIATION CLASS A MISHAPS.
(2)WORK TOWARD REDUCING OTHER MISHAP TYPES THAT ARE OR MAY BE SPECIFIC 
TO THEIR MISSION (E.G., AFLOAT CLASS A MISHAPS, AVIATION CLASS A 
MISHAPS, OPERATIONAL MV MISHAPS, ETC).
(3)SUPPORT MISHAP REDUCTION EFFORTS BY ENSURING CLASS A, B AND C 
MISHAPS ARE RECORDED AND REPORTED VIA THE WEB ENABLED SAFETY SYSTEM OR 
NAVAL MESSAGE, AS REQUIRED BY REF G.
(4) CONDUCT DETAILED ANALYSES OF THEIR CLASS A, B AND C MISHAPS, 
LESSONS LEARNED, NEAR MISSES AND LEADING INDICATORS TO IDENTIFY TRENDS 
AND DEFICIENCIES AND DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO REDUCE MISHAPS.
4.  OVERALL NAVY SUCCESS WILL BE MEASURED BY REDUCING MISHAPS 75% BY 
2012 FROM THE 2002 BASELINE IN THE FOLLOWING FOUR CATEGORIES IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH REF E:

                          	FY2012 CEILING

A. AVIATION CLASS A MISHAPS       4
B. PMV FATALITIES                16
C. CIVILIAN INJURIES*        16,356
D. MILITARY INJURIES**       1,457
NOTE: 
*TOTAL LOST DAYS BASED ON CIVILIAN LOST DAY RATE AS CALCULATED FROM THE 
DMDC WEBSITE; 
** MILITARY INJURIES RESULTING IN LOST DUTY TIME (HOSPITALIZATIONS AND 
QUARTERS) BASED ON LOST TIME CASE RATE.
5. WE HAVE WORKED HARD AND MADE GREAT PROGRESS SINCE WE WERE FIRST 
TASKED BY SECDEF IN 2004 TO REDUCE MISHAPS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THROUGH THE 
END OF FISCAL YEAR 2009 THE NAVY HAS ACHIEVED A 33% REDUCTION IN 
AVIATION CLASS A MISHAP RATES AND A 47% REDUCTION IN CLASS A PMV MISHAP 
RATES WHEN COMPARED TO THE FY2002 BASELINE.  ACHIEVING FURTHER 
REDUCTIONS WILL REQUIRE CONTINUED VIGILANCE AND LEADERSHIP INVOLVEMENT 
AT ALL LEVELS OF COMMAND. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WITH YOUR DILIGENT 
EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT THE DON SAFETY VISION WE CAN MEET THE 2012 MISHAP 
REDUCTION GOALS.
