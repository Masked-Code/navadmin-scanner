RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and provides transition 
assistance for the afloat community to assist the Navy in converting to Risk 
Management Framework (RMF) per references (b) and (c) by 31 December 2020.  
This RMF transition Afloat process is intended to provide an alternative 
solution for attaining RMF site authorizations for ships, which in turn will 
allow for a deliberate RMF transition of the systems hosted on those ships.

2.  Ships under U.S. Fleet Forces Command (USFF), Commander, U.S. Pacific 
Fleet (COMPACFLT) and Military Sealift Command (MSC) with Defense Information 
Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) Authorizations to 
Operate (ATO) that expire on or before 31 December 2020 are authorized to 
pursue an Afloat RMF Bridge Conversion (RBC).  The intent of the Afloat RBC 
is to utilize the assessed and certified risk of a full DIACAP submission, 
and issue an RMF ATO instead of a DIACAP ATO.  The Afloat RBC ATO will be 
issued for no more than three years.  All ships under the scope of this 
NAVADMIN will be required to transition to full RMF on or before the 
Authorization Termination Date (ATD) of their respective RBC.  Amplifying 
guidance is as follows:
    a.  Per references (d) and (e), the Package Submitting Officer (PSO) will 
process the package for a DIACAP Certification Determination (CD) issuance 
from the Navy Security Control Assessor for impacted ships.
    b.  The DIACAP CD shall be no older than 180 days.
    c.  Following the CD issuance, the PSO will process the package for an 
Afloat RBC following reference (e).
    d.  All DIACAP artifacts will be in compliance with reference (e).
    e.  The DIACAP artifacts that accompanied the DIACAP submission will be 
used to leverage Afloat RBCs.

3.  Programs outside of the afloat community are eligible for additional new 
alternate RMF transition processes, which are detailed in reference (f).

4.  This NAVADMIN is retroactive and allows afloat platforms that have 
already been granted an afloat RBC to be granted an administrative extension 
based on the original CD and authorization date not to exceed three years of 
original RBC.

5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.

6.  Released by VADM Matthew J. Kohler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
