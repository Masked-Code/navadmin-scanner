RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the reauthorization and modification of 
Naval Special Warfare Officer Continuation Pay (NSWOCP) for qualified Sea, 
Air and Land (SEAL) officers.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a).  
Retaining talented SEAL officers is a priority for the Navy.  NSWOCP is a 
monetary incentive that focuses on improving retention of junior and mid-
grade SEAL officers.  SEAL officers who meet the eligibility criteria in this 
NAVADMIN and hold an 1130 or 1137 designator may apply for this incentive.

2.  Program Overview.  This bonus is authorized under reference (b), Section 
332.  As of 2 April 2020, eligible officers will be offered the opportunity 
to commit to a 3 year or 4 year Phase 1 agreement and a 3 year, 4 year or 5 
year Phase 2 agreement for bonus amounts listed in paragraph 4.  The SEAL 
Officer Community Manager (BUPERS-311D) is designated as the NSWOCP Program 
Manager.  All applications for this bonus will be submitted to the program 
manager for approval, payment processing and tracking.  The eligibility 
criteria stated in this NAVADMIN can be subsequently modified by the program 
manager, if a bonus reduction is warranted based on NSW community 
requirements.
