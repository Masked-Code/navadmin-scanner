RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE REQUIREMENTS AND SOLICITS APPLICATIONS

USS JUNEAU, THIS GIFT WAS TO HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO THE USS ALASKA (CB 1), BUT 
THE USS ALASKA WAS DECOMMISSIONED BEFORE THE PRESENTATION.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE 
GOVERNOR OF THE TERRITORY OF ALASKA AND THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY AGREED THAT 
THE BOND WOULD BE LEFT ON DEPOSIT IN THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF JUNEAU UNTIL 
THE USS ALASKA WAS RECOMMISSIONED OR ANOTHER APPROPRIATE APPLICATION COULD BE 
FOUND.  IN 1986, THE NAVY ESTABLISHED THE ALASKA SEA SERVICES SCHOLARSHIP 
FUND.
