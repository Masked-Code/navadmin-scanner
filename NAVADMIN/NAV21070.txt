RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN updates vaccine eligibility for Service members and 
their dependents executing an overseas permanent change of station (PCS).  
This change is in accordance with the updated DOD Population Schema (REF H) 
and modifies (REF I) to modify para 3.c and add para 3.g as follows:
Change paragraph 3.c:
Quote

3.c. SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Priority.  The basic DOD schema is:
Tier 1a:  Healthcare and Emergency Service personnel.
Tier 1b:  Critical national capabilities, personnel forward deployed to 
austere locations, personnel preparing to deploy overseas, beneficiaries 75-
years-old and above.
Tier 1c:  Beneficiaries between 64 and 75-years-old, high-risk beneficiaries, 
personnel deployed/TDY OCONUS for over 30 days, essential workers not 
previously mentioned.
Tier 2:  Healthy uniformed personnel and population beneficiaries.
Unquote.
Change paragraph 3.c.1:
Quote:

3.c.1. Tier 1a is nearly complete.  Tier 1b will extend through April 2021.
Tier 1c will begin in April.  These dates are subject to change based on 
vaccine production.
Unquote.
To lessen the burden on overseas MTFs, ease logistics chains regarding 
overseas vaccine distribution, and aide Service members with navigating 
widely disparate foreign requirements, add paragraph 3.g:
Quote

3.g. Service members and their eligible dependents will be prioritized to 
receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine prior to executing an overseas PCS during the 
overseas screening process at their affiliated MTF.  Ensure vaccination 
timeline incorporates full immunization prior to travel.
