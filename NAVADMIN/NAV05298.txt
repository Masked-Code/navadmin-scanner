FUNCTIONAL AREA MANAGER (FAM) "APPROVED" ARE AUTHORIZED TRANSITION
ONTO THE NAVY MARINE CORPS INTRANET (NMCI) AND/OR ONE-NET (BASE LEVEL
INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE (BLII)). THIS RESTRICTION APPLIES TO
APPLICATIONS DESTINED TO BE TRANSITIONED INSIDE THE SECURITY ENCLAVE
AND/OR DMZ OF NMCI OR ONE-NET AND TO ALL METHODS USED TO TRANSITION
APPLICATIONS INTO NMCI AND/OR ONE-NET (E.G., CLIN 0027, CLIN 0029,
CLIN 0047, AND CLIN 0048 AND TECHNICAL REFRESH FOR NMCI).
2. BACKGROUND. AGGRESSIVE ELIMINATION OF EXISTING NETWORKS AND
TRANSITION OF THEIR ASSOCIATED SERVERS (SUPPORTING MISSION REQUIRED,
FAM "APPROVED" APPLICATIONS) TO DESIGNATED ENTERPRISE NETWORKS
(NMCI, ONE-NET) REMAINS A TOP PRIORITY, ALONG WITH THE REDUCTION OF
EXISTING APPLICATIONS THROUGH THE FAM BUSINESS CASE ANALYSIS (BCA)
FILTER/MIGRATION PLANNING AND ACQUISITION GUIDANCE PROCESS.  TO
ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT ECHELON II
COMMANDERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN PERMISSION TO TRANSITION SOME
APPLICATIONS CURRENTLY DESIGNATED IN DADMS AS FAM "ALLOWED WITH
RESTRICTION" (AWR) INTO NMCI AND/OR ONE-NET.
3. AMPLIFICATION.  DETAILED BUSINESS RULES AND PROCESS REQUIREMENTS
ARE CONTAINED IN REF A AND SUMMARIZED BELOW:



PAGE 04 RUENAAA3916 UNCLAS
A. APPLICATIONS WITH A FAM STATUS OF "AWR" ARE NOT PERMITTED TO
TRANSITION TO NMCI AND/OR ONE-NET WITHOUT SPECIFIC PERMISSION FROM
ECHELON I FAM AND ACNO(IT).  PERMISSION WILL BE REFLECTED IN DADMS
BY CHANGING THE CURRENT "AWR" APPLICATION TO "APPROVED - INTERIM
WAIVER" (AIW).  APPLICATIONS WILL RECEIVE A FAM "AIW" DISPOSITION
FOR ONLY SIX MONTHS UNLESS THE BCA FILTER/MIGRATION PLANNING AND
ACQUISITION GUIDANCE PROCESS HAS ESTABLISHED AN APPLICATION
MIGRATION DATE.  APPLICATIONS DESIGNATED AS "AWR" IN DADMS WILL BE
REMOVED FROM DESKTOPS DURING TECHNICAL REFRESH UNLESS THEIR
DISPOSITION HAS BEEN CHANGED TO FAM "APPROVED" AND/OR "AIW" IN
DADMS.
B. ECHELON II COMMANDERS SHOULD REQUEST VIA NAVAL MESSAGE A CHANGE
IN APPLICATION DISPOSITION IN DADMS FROM "AWR" TO "AIW".  THESE
REQUESTS WILL ONLY BE CONSIDERED IF THE ECHELON II COMMANDER
CERTIFIES THAT THE APPLICATION IS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE THE COMMAND'S
MISSION AND CANNOT BE TERMINATED BY MIGRATING TO A FAM "APPROVED"
APPLICATION IN TIME TO SUPPORT THE CYBER CONDITION ZEBRA (CCZ)
LEGACY NETWORK SHUTDOWN AND NMCI TECHNICAL REFRESH.  REQUESTS SHOULD
ALSO INCLUDE JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY A FAM "APPROVED" APPLICATION
CANNOT BE USED.  PRIOR TO REQUESTING AN "AWR" APPLICATION



PAGE 05 RUENAAA3916 UNCLAS
DISPOSITION CHANGE TO "AIW", ECHELON II COMMANDS SHOULD WORK WITH
THEIR ECHELON II MISSION GROUPS AND THE ECHELON I FAM TO COMPLETE
THE FAM BCA FILTER / MIGRATION PLANNING AND ACQUISITION GUIDANCE
PROCESS.  FOR APPLICATIONS IDENTIFIED FOR MIGRATION, ALL ATTEMPTS
SHOULD BE MADE TO COMPLETE MIGRATION TO THE TARGET APPLICATION PRIOR
TO REQUESTING A FAM DISPOSITION CHANGE. CCZ, TECH REFRESH AND
TERMINATION OF LEGACY NETWORKS WILL NOT BE DELAYED WHILE REQUESTS
FOR CHANGES IN FAM DISPOSITION ARE BEING PROCESSED. COMMANDS MUST
ENSURE APPLICATION STATUS IS UPDATED IF REQUIRED PRIOR TO THESE
SCHEDULED ACTIVITIES.
C. IAW REF B, THE SERVER/APPLICATION HOSTING REVIEW AND APPROVAL
PROCESS (SAHRAP) REQUIRES ORGANIZATIONS AT ANY LEVEL OF THE NAVY
RECEIVE PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL FROM THE PROGRAM EXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (PEO-IT) BEFORE PURCHASING, RENTING, OR
LEASING NEW OR UPGRADED SERVERS OR APPLICATION HOSTING SERVICES FOR
CONUS ASHORE USE.  AS PART OF THE NAVY'S OVERALL IT ASSET MANAGEMENT
STRATEGY, PEO-IT WILL ONLY APPROVE SAHRAP FOR SERVERS PLANNED FOR
APPLICATIONS WITH A FAM DISPOSITION IN DADMS OF "APPROVED" OR "AIW".
D. APPLICATIONS, WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN TRANSITIONED TO NMCI AND/OR
ONE-NET AND ARE IDENTIFIED AS "AWR" IN DADMS, WILL REMAIN CONNECTED



PAGE 06 RUENAAA3916 UNCLAS
TO NMCI AND ONE-NET AS APPLICABLE UNTIL FAM BCA FILTER / MIGRATION
PLANNING AND ACQUISITION GUIDANCE PROCESS IS EXECUTED.  RESULTS OF
THIS PROCESS WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THE APPLICATION REMAINS ON NMCI
OR ONE-NET.
E. APPLICATIONS TRANSITIONING TO NMCI AND/OR ONE-NET MUST STILL
OBTAIN THE REQUIRED CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION FROM THE
DESIGNATED APPROVAL AUTHORITY (DAA) IAW REF C.
F. REF D GUIDANCE FOR THE FREE CONNECTION OF SERVERS TO NMCI UNDER
CLIN 27 ONLY APPLIES TO SERVERS CONTAINING APPLICATIONS WITH A
DISPOSITION OF FAM "APPROVED" IN DADMS.
