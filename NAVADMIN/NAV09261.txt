SUBJ/2009 NATIONAL PRISONER OF WAR/MISSING IN ACTION RECOGNITION DAY//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN HIGHLIGHTS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PRISONER OF 
WAR/MISSING IN ACTION (POW/MIA) PUBLIC AWARENESS PROGRAM AND SOLICITS 
SUPPORT FOR THE 2009 NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY.

2.  TRADITIONALLY, THE ANNUAL OBSERVANCE OF NATIONAL POW/MIA 
RECOGNITION DAY IS ON THE THIRD FRIDAY OF SEPTEMBER.  TO COMMEMORATE 
THIS EVENT, THE WHITE HOUSE IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE A PRESIDENTIAL 
PROCLAMATION DESIGNATING 18 SEPTEMBER 2009 AS NATIONAL POW/MIA 
RECOGNITION DAY FOR 2009.  NAVY COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO HOST OR 
SUPPORT LOCAL NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY ACTIVITIES IN THEIR 
RESPECTIVE AREAS.  WHERE POSSIBLE, IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT FORMER 
PRISONERS OF WAR, AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF HOSTILE UNACCOUNTED FOR 
CASUALTIES, FROM PAST WARS AND CONFLICTS BE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN 
THESE CEREMONIES.

3.  THE THEME FOR 2009 IS:  "ALL GAVE SOME...SOME GAVE ALL!  HONOR 
THEIR SERVICE.  FULFILL THEIR TRUST."  THIS THEME EMPHASIZES THE 
SACRIFICES THAT AMERICAN SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN HAVE MADE THROUGHOUT 
HISTORY TO ENSURE THE FREEDOMS THAT OUR NATION, OUR FAMILIES, AND WE 
INDIVIDUALLY CONTINUE TO ENJOY.  IN ANSWERING THE CALL TO ARMS, MANY 
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN FORFEITED THEIR LIVES TO ENSURE FREEDOM FOR FUTURE 
GENERATIONS TO COME.  IT IS ONLY PROPER THAT WE WHO SERVE IN THE ARMED 
FORCES TODAY TAKE TIME TO REMEMBER OUR COMRADES WHO UNSELFISHLY 
DEFENDED OUR NATION, AND OUR FREEDOMS, WHEN CALLED UPON IN THE PAST.  
LET US NEVER FORGET THAT "FREEDOM IS NOT FREE!"
