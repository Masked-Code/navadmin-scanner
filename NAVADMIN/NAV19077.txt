RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN updates submission requirements for the Navy High Risk 
Escalation (HRE) and Information Technology (IT) procurement processes 
effective 1 April 2019.

2.  HRE Submission Changes:  All systems submitting HRE requests must provide 
their system, application, or portal Plan of Action and Milestones (POAMs) as 
directed in references (a) and (b).  Systems, applications and portals that 
do not have a C2C24 POAM will not be considered by the HRE Advisory Group 
(HREAG).  This is an important step in modernizing systems, applications, and 
portals to eliminate Cybersecurity vulnerabilities in legacy systems.  By 
applying resources to modernizing these systems, applications, and portals, 
we speed secure capability delivery and eliminate current cybersecurity 
threats.
    a.  All systems, applications, and portals, including those being 
decommissioned with no replacement within two years, must be reported to 
ensure effective architecture and resource planning.
For systems that are being decommissioned, documentation submitted must show 
funding is not continuing on the legacy system beyond the two-year transition 
period.
    b.  If a system, application, or portal within the C2C24 scope is being 
replaced with a newer version or another system, application or portal, and 
the fielding plan is within two years, then the C2C24 transition POAM will 
reflect compliance with the references (d) and
(e) for that replacement.

3.  The requirement to provide a C2C24 POAM does not apply to circuits or 
ONE-NET/NMCI/CANES network transport infrastructure (i.e., switches, routers, 
or network appliances like Palo Alto, InfoBlox for DNS).  It does apply to 
all servers hosting applications or content on those networks.

4.  Information Technology Procurement Request (ITPR) Submission
Changes:  ITPRs in support of IT systems, applications, and portals without 
completed C2C24 POAMs will be disapproved at all approval levels.

5.  Released by VADM Matthew J. Kohler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
