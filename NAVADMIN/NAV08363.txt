SUBJ/VICE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS HOLIDAY SAFETY MESSAGE//
 
POC/STAMOS, J.P./CAPT/OPNAV SAFETY LIAISON/LOC:NC1 CRYSTAL CITY
/EMAIL:JOHN.STAMOS@NAVY.MIL/TEL:COMM: 703-602-5030/ TEL:DSN: 332-5030/

RMKS/1. AS THE YEAR DRAWS TO A CLOSE, I AM PROUD OF THE WAY SAILORS 
HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO SERVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHETHER DEPLOYED 
ACROSS THE GLOBE OR SERVING IN SUPPORT POSITIONS STATESIDE, YOU'VE ALL 
DONE GREAT WORK IN THE SERVICE OF FREEDOM. AND NOW, AS IN YEARS PAST, 
SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE GATHERING TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE THE 
HOLIDAYS. THIS IS A TIME OF GREAT JOY FOR MANY OF US. HOWEVER, BE 
MINDFUL THAT IT ONLY TAKES ONE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT, DRUNK DRIVING INCIDENT, 
OR OFF-DUTY MISHAP TO TURN THE HOLIDAYS INTO A SEASON OF TRAGEDY.

2. IT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT TO THINK SAFETY DURING YOUR HOLIDAY VACATIONS 
AS IT IS EVERY DAY ON THE JOB. LAST YEAR, THREE SAILORS LOST THEIR 
LIVES BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S DAY. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS 
AN ACCEPTABLE LOSS IN OFF-DUTY MISHAPS, SO WE MUST BE VIGILANT IN 
FACING THE MANY CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TIME OF YEAR. AS 
SAILORS TRY TO BALANCE THEIR TIME BETWEEN HOME AND WORK DURING THE 
HOLIDAY SEASON, THERE IS PLENTY OF POTENTIAL FOR FATIGUED AND 
DISTRACTED DRIVING. HOLIDAY PARTIES CAN MEAN MORE IMPAIRED DRIVERS ARE 
ON THE ROAD. IF A CAR CRASH DOES OCCUR, SEAT BELTS ARE THE SINGLE 
BIGGEST FACTOR INFLUENCING YOUR SURVIVAL. REMEMBER TO BUCKLE UP EACH 
AND EVERY TIME YOU'RE IN A VEHICLE AND MAKE SURE ALL YOUR PASSENGERS DO 
AS WELL.

3.  IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT SOME OF OUR SHIPMATES MAY 
EXPERIENCE DEPRESSION DURING THE HOLIDAYS WHICH CAN HEIGHTEN THE RISK 
OF SUICIDE. EDUCATION, AWARENESS, AND INTRUSIVE PERSONAL LEADERSHIP AT 
EVERY LEVEL ARE KEY TO KEEPING SAILORS AND MARINES SAFE THIS HOLIDAY 
SEASON AND PREVENTING THIS BEHAVIOR.

4. THE NAVAL SAFETY CENTER HAS VIDEOS, PRESENTATIONS, POSTERS, AND MUCH 
MORE AVAILABLE AS PART OF THEIR WINTER SAFETY CAMPAIGN. USE THEM TO 
KEEP YOURSELF, YOUR SHIPMATES, AND YOUR FAMILIES SAFE ALL SEASON LONG. 
DOWNLOAD CAMPAIGN MATERIALS AT 
HTTP://SAFETYCENTER.NAVY.MIL/SEASONAL/WINTER08.

5. I THANK YOU FOR THE HIGH LEVEL OF PERSONAL COMMITMENT YOU BRING TO 
THE NAVY MISSION EVERY DAY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. AS WE PREPARE TO ENJOY 
THE HOLIDAYS, I ASK YOU TO MAINTAIN THIS SAME LEVEL OF ENERGY AND 
COMMITMENT TO YOUR OFF-DUTY ENDEAVORS THIS SEASON. I WISH YOU AND YOUR 
FAMILIES A VERY HAPPY HOLIDAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU 
RECHARGED AND BACK AT WORK IN JANUARY.

6. RELEASED BY ADMIRAL PATRICK M. WALSH, VICE CHIEF OF NAVAL 
OPERATIONS.//
