RMKS/1.  In alignment with reference (a), which encourages commands to reduce 
administrative distractions, this NAVADMIN announces the cancellation of the 
CNO Environmental Awards Program outlined in reference (b) due to its 
redundancy with the Department of Defense Environmental Awards Programs. 
Outstanding achievements by Navy installations and/or individuals in 
environmental compliance and restoration ashore and afloat, or natural and 
cultural resources management, will continue to be recognized under the 
Secretary of the Navy Environmental Awards and Secretary of Defense 
Environmental Awards.

     a.  Effective immediately, the CNO Environmental Awards Program
     is cancelled.
     b.  Reference (b) will be revised to reflect this cancellation
     and incorporate the change from this NAVADMIN.

2.  This cancellation in no way diminishes the Navy’s long-standing emphasis 
on environmental compliance, planning, and restoration ashore and afloat; and 
conservation of natural and cultural resources. The Navy’s commitment to 
compliance, protection, and proper management of environmental resources 
ensures ongoing access to land, air, and sea for our training and testing 
missions.

3.  Submissions for the Department of Defense Environmental Awards Programs 
are highly encouraged.  OPNAV N4 will continue to process packages submitted 
for those award programs per reference (b), chapter 6, section 6-3.6.

4.  Released by VADM D. R. Smith, N4.//
