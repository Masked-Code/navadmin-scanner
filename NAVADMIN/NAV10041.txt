AMPN/REF A IS SCREENING REQUIREMENTS FOR ASSIGNMENT AS A RECRUIT  
DIVISION COMMANDER.//

RMKS/1.  PART OF NAVYS TOTAL FORCE VISION FOR THE 21ST CENTURY IS TO 
DRAW OUR STRENGTH AND INNOVATION FROM THE DIVERSITY OF OUR NATION.  THE 
NAVY IS FOCUSING ITS EFFORT ON EMERGING TALENT MARKETS AND IS WORKING 
TO INCREASE FEMALE ACCESSIONS IN FY10.  THE MOTIVATION AND PROFESSIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT OF YOUNG SAILORS AT RECRUIT TRAINING CENTER (RTC) GREAT 
LAKES IS A VITAL MISSION, ONE THAT CAN BENEFIT FROM THE PRESENCE OF 
OUTSTANDING FEMALE ROLE MODELS.

2.  INCREASING FEMALE RECRUIT DIVISION COMMANDER (RDC) MANNING LEVELS 
ALIGNS WITH THE INCREASE IN FEMALE ACCESSIONS, HOWEVER, RDC MANNING 
COMPETES WITH OTHER SPECIAL SHORE PROGRAMS FOR OUR TALENTED FEMALE 
ENLISTED LEADERS.  A MODIFICATION TO THE CURRENT DETAILING ASSIGNMENT 
POLICIES IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE OUR NEW SAILORS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
LEARN FROM OUR BEST FEMALE ENLISTED LEADERS.  AS A RESULT, FEMALE 
SAILORS CONSIDERING THIS OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP OPPORTUNITY ARE BEING 
OFFERED SEA TOUR CURTAILMENT (UP TO ONE YEAR EARLY) OR SHORE TO SHORE 
ASSIGNMENT TO SERVE AS A RDC.  THESE NEW OPTIONS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE 
BENEFITS RDCS ALREADY RECEIVE AS LISTED IN REF A.  DURING 2010, WE 
ANTICIPATE OPENINGS FOR APPROXIMATELY 50 ADDITIONAL FEMALE RDCS, IN 
ORDER TO REACH THE 100 PERCENT REQUIREMENT OF 127 FEMALE RDCS.

3.  RDC ASSIGNMENTS OFFER A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT PROFESSIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT, DIVERSIFICATION, LEADERSHIP AND CAREER ADVANCEMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES.  IF YOU ARE A HARD-CHARGING, DISCIPLINED FEMALE SAILOR, 
WHO POSSESSES STRONG CHARACTER AND PERSONAL INTEGRITY, AND WANT TO 
PURSUE THE MOST CHALLENGING SAILORIZATION DUTY ASHORE, THEN THE NAVY 
WANTS YOU AS A RDC.
