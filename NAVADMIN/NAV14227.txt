RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN promulgates the list of Navy commands scheduled to 
receive a Chief of Naval Operations Integrated Vulnerability Assessment 
(CNOIVA), Critical Infrastructure Program
(CIP) Assessment, or Mission Assurance Assessment-Navy (Pilot) (MAA
-N(P)) during Fiscal Year 2015 (FY15).

2.  These assessments help prevent and/or reduce the impact of a terrorist 
attack and assist Commanding Officers in meeting their antiterrorism and 
force protection (AT/FP) responsibilities.
    a.  IAW Ref A, para 2, Navy commands requiring an antiterrorism
    program will undergo a higher headquarters integrated
    vulnerability
    assessment every three years.
    b.  Certain Navy commands have been selected to receive CIP
    assessments based on critical missions and assets.
    c.  Since DoD and Navy are replacing integrated vulnerability and
    CIP assessments with multi-functional MAA-N in the near future,
    Navy
    will conduct MAA-N(P) at two Navy commands.  The MAA-N(P)
    assessments will be preceded by an MAA-N(P) Pre-Site Survey (PSS)
    which is critical to the development of the command and tenant
    missions decomposition process.

4.  Conduct of Assessments:
    a.  Commands scheduled for CNOIVA, CIP or MAA-N(P) Assessments
    have received or will receive a letter 60-90 days prior to the on
    -site assessment date identifying specific information and
    logistics
    support required for the Assessment Team.
    b.  At a minimum, each team requires:
        (1) Working space with 24 hour access, a LAN or DSL cable
        connection with Internet access and storage for a small
        quantity of
        confidential classified material.
        (2) Hardcopies of the Antiterrorism (AT) Plan; Plans for
        Response to Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction; Disaster
        Preparedness Plan; previous Joint Security Integrated
        Vulnerability
        Assessments and CNOIVA reports; Security Department post or
        guard
        force orders and Standard Operating Procedures; and a Base
        Map that
        delineates buildings and streets.
        (3) A 15-passenger van for a windshield tour.
        (4) An in-brief on the first day of the Assessment for the
        team to provide the Installation Commanding Officer and staff
        an
        overview.
        (5) Access to personnel responsible for the following
        functional areas:  anti-terrorist operations, security
        operations,
        structural engineering, infrastructure engineering, and
        operational
        readiness.
        (6) If a CIP Assessment is scheduled, provide contact
        information for the Defense Critical Infrastructure POC.
        (7) An out-brief for the Installation Commanding Officer and
        staff.  The out-brief will present options for the
        Installation
        Commanding Officer to consider in pursuing improvements to
        force
        protection and to formulating budget submissions.
    c.  The formal Assessment Report will be forwarded to the Command
    within 90 days of completion.  The report will list findings,
    including vulnerabilities, dependencies, single points of failure
    ,
    and remediation/mitigation recommendations.

5.  Background:
    a.  CNOIVA
        (1) Using a vulnerability-based assessment, the CNOIVA
        determines a command*s ability to deter and/or respond to
        terrorist
        incidents.
        (2) The CNOIVA evaluates the consequences of terrorist acts
        in terms of a command's ability to accomplish its
        mission.  Vulnerability-based assessment methodology reviews
        site
        -specific characteristics, mission, threat analyses, security
        plans,
        procedures, threat and disaster response capabilities, and
        other
        specific command concerns.
        (3) IAW Ref B, Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS)
        Security Training, Assessment and Assistance Teams (STAAT)
        conduct
        the CNOIVA assessments using Ref C.
    b.  CIP
        (1) The CIP assesses a command*s ability to support mission
        requirements and identify supporting infrastructure
        vulnerabilities
        (e.g., electric power, communications, fuels, transportation)
        and
        dependencies.
        (2) The CIP reviews site-specific characteristics, mission
        and infrastructure plans, projects, procedures and response
        capabilities.
        (3) The Mission Assurance Division (MAD) at Naval Surface
        Warfare Center Dahlgren Division conducts CIP assessment
        using Refs
        D and E.
    c.  MAA-N Pilot (P)
        (1) MAA-N(P) is Navy*s approach to the proposed Joint Chiefs
        of Staff Joint Mission Assurance Assessment.
        (2) The MAA-N(P) combines several assessments into a single
        assessment and minimizes operational and logistical impacts
        to the
        Command, reduces cost, and maximizes effectiveness of the
        Assessment
        Team via information-sharing and identification of
        vulnerabilities
        and mitigation strategies across multiple program areas to
        include
        critical infrastructure, anti-terrorism, emergency management
        ,
        physical security and cyber operations.
        (3) NCIS STAAT and MAD will conduct the MAA-N(P) using Refs D
        and E.

6.  Any changes to the schedule in para. 3 must be coordinated with message 
POCs.
