CAPTAINS.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the FY-19 Full Time Support 
(FTS) Captain Selective Retention (SELRET) Board.

2.  The SELRET Board is required to retain FTS Captains beyond three years 
time in grade bringing FTS inventory in line with authorized end strength, 
allowing for stable promotion opportunity, and permitting sufficient junior 
officer accessions to meet FTS officer operational requirements.  FTS 
officers subject to involuntary release from active duty as a result of this 
board will be retained on active duty, if necessary, to become eligible for 
retirement with pay.

3.  The FTS Captain SELRET Board will convene on 19 September 2018 to 
consider FTS Captains in all competitive categories for retention.  FTS 
Captains who were promoted during FY-17 will be looked at for their first 
gate and FTS Captains who were promoted during FY-14 will be looked at for 
their second gate.  In line with reference (a), second gate FTS Captains not 
selected for retention will retire or be released from active duty no later 
than 1 September 2019.  In line with reference (b), first gate FTS Captains 
not selected for retention will retire or be released from active duty no 
later than 1 September 2020.  In either case, FTS officers will be retained 
on active duty, if necessary, to enable the officer to become eligible for 
retirement with pay.

4.  Amplifying information will be posted on the FTS Community Manager 
website: http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/communitymanagers/reserve/fts/Pages/FTSCAPTSELRET.aspx.
The authorized number of selections for retention will be posted as part of 
the board convening order on the board convening date.
