RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN is an update to reference (a) that extends the 
submission date for applications to 1 June 2018.  Additionally, this update 
also identifies required Navy Enlisted Classifications
(NEC) for Information Systems Technician conversions utilizing the new NEC 
construct.  This cycle of conversions will be for the initial enlisted 
integration of USS GEORGIA (SSGN-729) submarine crews in Kings Bay, GA.  
Additionally, applicants will be considered for conversion to fill billets on 
previously integrated submarines in Kings Bay, GA and Bangor, WA due to 
personnel rotating to shore duty.

2.  Beginning this cycle, applications will be processed as they are 
received.  Since available rating quotas will be filled as applications are 
processed, it is recommended Sailors submit applications as soon as possible.  
Applicants can expect to be notified by the Submarine Enlisted Community 
Manager (ECM), Enlisted Nuclear/Submarine Assignments Division (PERS-403) and 
Military Community Management, Enlisted of results within one to two months 
after submission.

3.  The Submarine Force is seeking female applicants from all ratings.  
Sailors from all communities are eligible to apply for submarine service as 
part of this initiative.  In line with this NAVADMIN, PERS-403 is accepting 
conversion applications for ranks
E-1 through E-8.  Additional information regarding the selection process and 
application requirements can be found at http://www.navy.mil/ewis or 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/enlisted/community/submarine/pages/
enlistedwomeninsubmarines.aspx.
    a.  For E-6 and below Sailors, the following submarine career fields are 
open for conversion (the Non-Nuclear ECM will best fit each Sailor to a 
rating based on their application package inputs and continued need for each 
rating):
        (1) Service Support Career Field includes the following
ratings:  Yeoman Submarines (YNS), Culinary Specialist Submarines (CSS), and 
Logistics Specialist Submarines (LSS).
        (2) Submarine Electronics Career Field includes the following 
ratings:  Sonar Technician Submarines (STS), Fire Control Technician (FT), 
Electronics Technician-Navigation (ETV), Electronics Technician 
Communications (ETR), and Information Systems Technician Submarines (ITS).
        (3) Mechanical Career Field includes the following ratings:
Machinists Mate-Weapons (MMW), and Machinists Mate-Auxiliary (MMA).
    b.  Applications for E-7/E-8 will be accepted in the following
ratings:  ITS (see note 1 below), LSS, CSS, and YNS (see note 2 below).  
Sailors interested in serving as the Independent Duty Corpsman (IDC) should 
contact the Force IDCs listed below for additional information regarding 
volunteering for this program.
Note 1:  E-7/E-8 Information Systems Technician conversions must have one or 
more of the following Navy enlisted classifications:

Note 2:  E-7/E-8 Personnel Specialists (PS) are encouraged to apply.
Each application will be assessed to ensure the chief petty officer has the 
experience and expertise to manage and oversee all administrative and 
personnel actions to support the crew in the role of leading YNS onboard a 
submarine.

4.  All Sailors, regardless of rating or rank, must meet the following 
minimum criteria to be eligible for conversion:
    a.  Be a U.S. citizen already in possession of, or capable of receiving, 
a secret security clearance.
    b.  Meet Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) requirements 
for the desired rating(s) as outlined in reference (b).
    c.  Have no Non-Judicial Punishments or convictions in civilian or

            (b) Submarine career field choices in order of preference of the 
sailor.
            (c) Homeport preference for either Kings Bay, GA or Bangor, WA.

to be processed).  However, candidates must have a current submarine duty 
physical approved by an Undersea Medical Officer (UMO) within 30 days of 
application submission.  Due to the nature of submarine service, medical 
fitness for duty standards are stringent.  Therefore, interested candidates 
are encouraged to start this process as soon as possible following their 
decision to apply.
            (a) The Medical History Form (DD Form 2807-1) and Physical 
Examination Form (DD Form 2808) may be completed by any Department of Defense 
privileged provider.  However, a UMO is required to review and approve the 
overall submarine duty physical on DD Form 2808.  UMOs are located at all 
submarine homeport medical departments.  Contact numbers and locations of 
submarine homeport medical departments and UMOs:
        (1) Naval Submarine Support Center New London (Sub Base):
(860) 694-2470/2795.

Submarine Forces Pacific (COMSUBPAC) Force IDC at the numbers below for 
further guidance on obtaining a submarine duty physical.
        (1) COMSUBLANT Force IDC (Norfolk):  (757) 836-1351/1354.
        (2) COMSUBPAC Force IDC (Pearl Harbor):

    c.  All Sailors listed in paragraph 5 of reference (e) will automatically 
be considered for selection.  Sailors are encouraged to contact the Submarine 
Non-Nuclear ECM (see paragraph 10 for contact information) to discuss ways to 
improve chances for selection and update their application.
    d.  Professional Apprentice Career Track Sailors and junior rated Sailors 
are encouraged to apply, even with limited time in service, no warfare 
qualification, or at-sea experience, since there is a requirement for female 
submarine Sailors at all pay grades.

6.  Applications must be scanned and delivered to the Non-Nuclear Submarine 
ECM.  E-mail applications to aaron.norton(at)navy.mil, 
john.cambis(at)navy.mil, ryan.rhea(at)navy.mil, and 
jared.c.smith(at)navy.mil.  An example package is available at 
www.navy.mil/ewis or http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/
enlisted/community/submarine/pages/enlistedwomeninsubmarines.aspx.

7.  Prior to detailing selectees, PERS-403 will work with commands to 
minimize the impact on the specific mission of the command as the Sailor 
transitions to submarine service.

8.  If a selectee is required to conduct a conversion from the reserve 
component to active component before being eligible for orders, the selectee 
is required to coordinate directly with Submarines Non-nuclear (BUPERS-322) 
personnel identified in paragraph 10 to allocate a Career Waypoint quota for 
conversion.
Failing to do so will result in a delay in the order writing process and 
follow-on assignment.

9.  The application process for E-6 and below nuclear-trained personnel will 
be announced by Chief of Naval Operations, Nuclear Propulsion Programs (OPNAV 
N133) and coordinated by the individual Sailor's Command Career Counselor at 
the Nuclear Power Training Units (NPTU).  OPNAV N133 will work with the NPTUs 
to establish application deadlines that maximize opportunity for selection.
Female junior staff instructors or Sailors in initial training at NPTU 
interested in volunteering for submarine duty should inform their chain of 
command as soon as possible in order to adequately manage their career 
timing.  Selections for nuclear-trained enlisted women for the USS OHIO 
(SSGN-726) will occur in the summer of 2018, and selections for the USS 
GEORGIA (SSGN-729) in the summer of 2019.

10.  For questions about the application process or about submarine service, 
contact the Submarine Non-Nuclear ECM office:  LCDR Jared Smith, (901) 874-
2082/DSN 882, LT Ryan Rhea, (901) 874-2081/DSN 882,
