RMKS/1.  THIS MESSAGE, THE FIFTH IN THE STAY NAVY SERIES, PROVIDES AN 
OVERVIEW OF FY-07 RETENTION AND GUIDANCE ON FY-08 PLANS AND GOALS.  IN 
FY-08, WE CONTINUE ON OUR GRADUAL PATH TO REACHING A STEADY STATE FORCE 
OF APPROXIMATELY 322,000 ACTIVE DUTY AND 67,000 SELECTED RESERVE 
COMPONENT PERSONNEL BY THE END OF FY-09.  GIVEN THAT WE WILL NOT JUST 
HAVE A SMALLER FORCE, BUT ALSO A DIFFERENT FORCE, WITH MORE DEMANDS AND 
A WIDER RANGE OF MISSIONS, WE CAN ONLY SUCCEED IF WE SHAPE OUR FORCE TO 
SUPPORT “FIT” THROUGHOUT THE NAVY.  “FIT” MEANS HAVING THE RIGHT SAILOR, 
AT THE RIGHT PLACE, AT THE RIGHT TIME.  HOW CAN YOU, AS A NAVY LEADER, 
ENSURE WE HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE FIGHTING FORCE?  BY ENGAGING YOUR 
SAILORS IN FACE-TO-FACE COMMUNICATION TO CONVEY THE BENEFITS OF STAYING 
NAVY.
2.  SUMMARY OF FY-07 RETENTION EFFORTS:
    A.  ALL-NAVY FY-07 REENLISTMENT RATE
            GOAL        ACTUAL
ZONE A      50 PERCENT  46.0 PERCENT (0 TO 6 YEARS OF SERVICE)
ZONE B      60 PERCENT  57.6 PERCENT (6 TO 10 YEARS OF SERVICE)
ZONE C      80 PERCENT  81.8 PERCENT (10 TO 14 YEARS OF SERVICE)
NOTE:  MEASURES FORMAL REENLISTMENTS PLUS LONG-TERM EXTENSIONS (EQUAL 
OR GREATER THAN 24 MONTHS)
    B.  ALL-NAVY 12-MONTH ATTRITION RATE
                ACTUAL
ZONE A     9.09 PERCENT
ZONE B     2.83 PERCENT
ZONE C     2.08 PERCENT
NOTE:  (1) PERCENTAGE BASED UPON MEMBERS WHO WERE RELEASED FROM SERVICE 
GREATER THAN 90 DAYS PRIOR TO EAOS.
       (2) WE HAVE CLOSELY MONITORED A POSITIVE ATTRITION TREND IN 
RECENT MONTHS DUE TO FEWER LOSSES FROM PHYSICAL FITNESS ASSESSMENT 
FAILURES IN ALL THREE ZONES. 
3.  ACHIEVING FIT THROUGH RETENTION.  THE RETENTION GOALS AND 
ACHIEVEMENTS LISTED IN PARA 2 INDICATE AN AGGREGATE OF EVERY SAILOR IN 
THE NAVY.  IN FY-08, MY GOAL IS TO MOVE BEYOND MEASURING RETENTION IN 
AN AGGREGATE PERSPECTIVE INSTEAD FOCUSING ON RETENTION AT A DETAILED 
AND TACTICAL LEVEL.  AT THE TACTICAL LEVEL, THIS MEANS LEADERS MUST 
KNOW RETENTION GOALS BY RATING, NOT BY AGGREGATE.  EACH RATING HAS A 
SPECIFIC REENLISTMENT TARGET BASED ON BILLET STRUCTURE AND AVAILABLE 
INVENTORY.  SOME RATINGS REQUIRE A REENLISTMENT RATE IN THE 90 PERCENT 
TO 100 PERCENT RANGE FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH, WHILE OTHER RATINGS REQUIRE 
ONLY 35 PERCENT TO BE HEALTHY.  FOR EXAMPLE, ALTHOUGH THE AGGREGATE 
REENLISTMENT GOAL FOR ZONE A SAILORS IS 48 PERCENT IN FY-08, THE GOAL 
FOR AVIATION TECHNICIAN (AT) IS 30 PERCENT, WHILE THE GOAL FOR 
ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN SUBMARINE SERVICE (ETSS) IS 68 PERCENT.  COMMAND 
UNDERSTANDING OF THESE INDIVIDUAL GOALS IS IMPERATIVE IN INFLUENCING 
THE DESIRED REENLISTMENT BEHAVIOR FOR OUR MOST CRITICAL RATINGS.  IN 
MANY RATINGS, REENLISTMENTS ARE TRACKED TO THE SINGLE PERSON.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, IN FY-07 THE FIRE CONTROL TECHNICIAN (FT) RATING HAD A ZONE A 
REENLISTMENT GOAL OF 65 CONTRACTS, BUT ONLY 39 SAILORS REENLISTED. 
THE 26 ADDITIONAL REENLISTMENTS BREAK DOWN TO ONLY ONE ADDITIONAL FT 
REENLISTMENT PER EVERY TWO SUBMARINES ? A VERY ACHIEVABLE TASK. 
EACH ENTERPRISE HAS SIMILAR RATING EXAMPLES WHERE ONE OR TWO ADDITIONAL 
REENLISTMENTS PER SHIP/SQUADRON WILL ENSURE THE GOAL IS MET.  WE ARE 
NOT FAR FROM THE REENLISTMENT GOALS, BUT NEED YOUR PERSONAL 
INTERVENTION TO CLOSE THE GAP.  TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY VISIBILILTY, 
OPNAV N13 WILL SEND MONTHLY EMAILS CONTAINING PROGRESS TOWARDS 
ATTAINING NAVY-WIDE, RATING-SPECIFIC REENLISTMENT GOALS TO THE FLEET 
N1S AND TO LEADERSHIP OF THE FLEET READINESS AND PROVIDER ENTERPRISES.  
THIS INFORMATION WILL ALSO BE DISPLAYED ON THE ENLISTED RETENTION 
DASHBOARD LOCATED ON BUPERS ONLINE AT HTTPS://WWW.BOL.NAVY.MIL.
4.  TARGETED RETENTION GOALS.  WE ALL MUST BECOME MORE PERSONAL WITH 
OUR STAY NAVY MESSAGE TO OUR SAILORS IF WE ARE TO BETTER SHAPE THE NAVY.  
WHILE THE ACTUAL REENLISTMENT RATES, WHEN COMBINED WITH SHORT-TERM 
EXTENSIONS, KEPT THE NAVY WITHIN FY-07 END STRENGTH REQUIREMENTS, 
LONGER-TERM RETENTION AND IMPROVED REENLISTMENT RATES ARE NECESSARY TO 
SUPPORT A STABILIZED FORCE OF THE FUTURE.  AT A MINIMUM, WE NEED FY-08 
REENLISTMENT RATES AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE WHAT WE ACHIEVED IN FY-07. 
       ALTHOUGH IT IS VERY EARLY IN FY-08, REENLISTMENT RATES IMPROVED 
IN ALL THREE ZONES COMPARED TO THE SAME TIME IN FY-07:
ALL-NAVY FYTD REENLISTMENT RATES
             FY-08 GOAL       OCTOBER 2006       OCTOBER 2007
ZONE A       48 PERCENT       57.5 PERCENT       60.4 PERCENT
ZONE B       58 PERCENT       65.2 PERCENT       68.7 PERCENT
ZONE C       82 PERCENT       85.2 PERCENT       85.8 PERCENT
THIS IMPROVEMENT IS A POSITIVE SIGN, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE INITIAL 
CHALLENGE OF PAYING SRB?S AT THE FY-08 LEVELS BECAUSE OF LIMITATIONS IN 
THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION.  SINCE THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE FY-08 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT ON 13 NOVEMBER 2007, WE SHOULD 
NOW BE FULL STEAM AHEAD IN OUR 2008 RETENTION PUSH.
5.  FUTURE RETENTION EFFORTS.  THE CENTER FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND 
OPNAV N13 HOSTED A RETENTION CONFERENCE 1-2 NOVEMBER IN MILLINGTON, TN.  
THE CONFERENCE WAS VERY WELL ATTENDED BY A BROAD RANGE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE FLEET, AND PRODUCED ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS 
TO IMPROVE REENLISTMENT AND REDUCE ATTRITION ACROSS ALL ZONES.  WE WILL 
WORK QUICKLY TO INSTITUTE CHANGES WHICH ARE BOTH EFFECTIVE AND 
SUPPORTIVE FOR OUR SAILORS.  EXAMPLES INCLUDE (1) REVISING THE PERFORM 
TO SERVE PROCESS (PTS), INCLUDING THE BUSINESS RULES; (2) CONDUCTING 
BOTH OFFICER AND ENLISTED RETENTION QUICK POLLS IN DECEMBER 2007 TO 
OBTAIN FLEET INPUT ON OUR MOST PRESSING RETENTION-RELATED ISSUES; AND 
(3) DEVELOPING A REENLISTMENT LEAVE POLICY.
6.  RETENTION MONITORING - OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO SIZE, SHAPE, AND 
STABILIZE THE FORCE RELY HEAVILY ON ACCURATE, TIMELY AND STANDARDIZED 
ENLISTED RETENTION DATA.  THE NAVY RETENTION MONITORING SYSTEM (NRMS) 
PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO COMPUTE A WIDE ARRAY OF ALL- NAVY AND UNIT 
LEVEL REENLISTMENT AND ATTRITION STATISTICS PER REF A. 
NRMS USERS CAN CONDUCT AD HOC QUERIES ON A WIDE-ARRAY OF MEASURES (E.G., 
RACE/ETHNIC, PAYGRADE, UIC, PLATFORM TYPE, GENDER, RATING, ETC.), AS 
WELL AS RETRIEVE STANDARD (CANNED) REPORTS.  DATA IS AVAILABLE FROM 
1992 TO PRESENT, ALLOWING EVALUATION OF RETENTION OVER TIME.  NRMS ALSO 
INCLUDES A METRIC TO MONITOR RESERVE AFFILIATION RATES.  AS OF OCTOBER 
2007, MORE THAN 4,925 INDIVIDUALS HAVE NRMS ACCOUNTS.  COMMANDS WHICH 
DESIRE ACCESS TO NRMS NEED TO COMPLETE A SYSTEM ACCESS AUTHORIZATION 
REQUEST (SAAR) AT HTTPS://NSIPS.NMCI.NAVY.MIL.  THE CENTER FOR CAREER 
DEVELOPMENT(CCD) IS THE FUNCTIONAL MANAGER FOR NRMS.  POINTS OF CONTACT 
AT CCD FOR NRMS ARE NCC JAMES STUART AT (901) 874-2223/DSN 882 OR EMAIL 
AT JAMES.STUART1(AT)NAVY.MIL, AND NCC KELLY STRICKLAND AT
(901) 874-2488/DSN 882 OR EMAIL AT KELLY.STRICKLAND(AT)NAVY.MIL.
7.  COMMANDING OFFICERS, OFFICERS-IN-CHARGE, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, 
COMMAND MASTER CHIEFS, AND COMMAND CAREER COUNSELORS CAN OBTAIN ACCESS 
TO THE ENLISTED RETENTION DASHBOARD BY SENDING AN EMAIL TO THE CENTER 
FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT POINT OF CONTACT, MRS. GRETCHEN CAMPBELL AT (901)
