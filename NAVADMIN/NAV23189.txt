SUBJ/NAVY ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT - UPDATED ORGANIZATION CHANGE REQUEST 
MANUAL AND OCR FORM// 
 
REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/19 APR 23// 
REF/B/DOC/OPNAV/09 NOV 22// 
REF/C/DOC/OPNAV/JUN 2023// 
 
AMPN/Reference (a) is OPNAVINST 5400.44B Navy Organization Change Manual. 
Reference (b) is the Standard Navy Distribution List. 
Reference (c) is the OPNAV 5400-1 Form revision June 2023.// 
 
RMKS/1. Purpose. Notify organizations of the latest revision and release of 
the OPNAVINST 5400.44B Navy and updated OPNAV Form 5400/1. 
 
2. Major updates to the OPNAVINST 5400.44B include the procedures and 
processes for submission of Organization Change Request (OCR) actions and 
Standard Navy Distribution List (SNDL) to Director, Navy Staff (DNS) for 
changes and modifications.  On 2 May 2022, the Department of the Navy (DON) 
transitioned to Enterprise Task Management Solution System (ETMS2). 
References (a) and (b) are both revised to incorporate ETMS2 processes and 
updated the location of the SNDL. 
 
3. Reference (c) has been updated to enable electronic approvals and is to be 
submitted to DNS12 with digital signatures versus wet ink scanned copies 
uploaded to ETMS2. This allows for echelon 1 resource sponsors and 
coordination echelon 2 organizations to additionally sign the same form 
without multiple incomplete copies existing for submission to DNS 12. Form is 
available for download from DLA Forms online 
website: https://forms.documentservices.dla.mil/order/. 
 
4. Due to issues with the OPNAV portal access for personnel without 
flankspeed accounts, the SNDL is additionally hosted on a MilSuite and 
updated quarterly: "https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/cno-dns12-navy-
organization-management." The OPNAV portal will continue to host the primary 
SNDL location and is updated as frequently as required by changes submitted 
to the DNS 12 team: 
" https://flankspeed.sharepoint-
mil.us/sites/OPNAV/DNS/DNS1/DNS12/SitePages/Home.aspx ". 
 
5.  For questions or concerns regarding OCRs, please contact your local 
administrative team, echelon 2 point of contact, or the DNS 12 Navy 
Organization Management Team at dns12navyorgmgt(at)us.navy.mil. 
 
6.  Applicability.  This NAVADMIN is applicable to all commands who submit 
OCRs to DNS or on behalf of subordinate commands. 
 
7.  Released by Mr. Andrew S. Haeuptle, Director, Navy Staff.//
