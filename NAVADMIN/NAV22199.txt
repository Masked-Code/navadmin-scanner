RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Advancement Examination Readiness 
Review (AERR) schedule from October 2022 to April 2023.  AERR events 
provide an opportunity for selected Fleet subject matter experts (FSME) 
from Fleet and shore-based commands to impact their respective ratings 
by updating and validating the examination question bank.  Selected 
chief, senior chief, and master chief petty officers on Active Duty, 
Training and Administration of the Reserves, and Reservists currently 
on Active Duty for Operational Support may take part in the process. 
AERRs enable the Navy to advance the most qualified and rating- 
knowledgeable Sailors. 
 
2.  AERRs are held at Naval Education and Training Professional 
Development Center (NETPDC) in Pensacola, FL.  Temporary duty travel 
(TDY) in support of AERR events is considered mission critical and is 
flag officer approved.  All costs pertaining to TDY are funded by 
NETPDC.  All travel will be in line with Department of the Navy 
regulations at the time of the scheduled AERR. 
 
3.  In line with reference (a), type commanders (TYCOM) and rating 
sponsors will recruit rating FSMEs, select AERR attendees plus two

AERR selectees.  Provide above information no less than 45 days prior 
to the AERR convening date with the exception of the 16 - 29 October 
convening which requires the above information no less than 30 days 
prior.
