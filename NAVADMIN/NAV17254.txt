AMPN/REF A IS NAVADMIN 043/09, MANDATORY USE OF THE NAVY STANDARD INTEGRATED 
PERSONNEL SYSTEM (NSIPS) ELECTRONIC SERVICE RECORD (ESR).//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the phased implementation of self- service 
capability in the Electronic Service Record (ESR) within Navy Standard 
Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) for processing emergency contact and 
dependency information.  Training for specific regions, along with self-paced 
or individual training, is conducted by region and as operational schedules 
permit over the next 24 months.  Updated processes and command requirements 
are also added for clarification.  These new capabilities are interim 
enhancements to our legacy systems, while the new systems and processes of 
Sailor
2025 are finalized.

2.  Updated Process for Sailors:
    a.  The data for Record of Emergency Data (RED) and Dependency 
Application (DA) currently resides on the NAVPERS 1070/602, Dependency 
Application/Record of Emergency Data, that is most commonly known as the Page 
2.  This current single process has been separated into two documents, the 
Dependency Application (NAVPERS
1070/602) and Record of Emergency Data (DD Form 93).  The digitally signed DD 
Form 93 is transmitted directly to the Official Military Personnel File 
(OMPF) and the DA is submitted for review through a workflow.  This will 
eliminate personally identifiable information
(PII) violations that resulted from the co-processing of RED and DA 
information.
    b.  RED initiative is a self-service capability for Active and Reserve 
members to manage their own record of emergency data.
Service members can enter or update emergency data and generate a DD Form 93 
for digital signature with their common access card (CAC).
Once digitally signed and submitted by the Service member, the form is 
electronically sent to the OMPF of the Service member.
    c.  DA initiative is a self-service capability for Active and Reserve 
members to enter or update dependency data and generate a NAVPERS 1070/602 
form for electronic signature with their CAC.  Once digitally signed and 
submitted by the Service member, the transaction will flow electronically to 
the servicing personnel office for review and approval.  The servicing 
personnel office will process all pay and entitlements associated with the 
new DA and electronically submit the form to the OMPF of the Service member.  
A review by servicing personnel office representatives is required because 
changes to the DA form may impact the pay and allowances of a Service member.  
This new capability also includes the ability to upload supporting 
documentation in the form of scanned PDF files.

3.  Updated Process for Commands.  Command Pay and Personnel Administrators 
(CPPA) are required to request the Command RED and DA user role for the unit 
identification code(s) (UIC) they manage.
The Command RED and DA user role will provide the command direct access to 
monitor pending transactions and review various RED and DA reports and 
metrics.  Electronic reports provide command visibility to ensure Sailors are 
in compliance with annual RED and DA verification requirements.  To gain 
access, CPPA will be required to submit two system access authorization 
requests (SAAR).  They are both located on the NSIPS homepage 
https://nsipsprod.nmci.navy.mil/ (CAC access required).  The electronic SAAR 
can be accessed by clicking "New Users" link and the SAAR-N can be accessed 
by clicking on the SAAR-N Form, OPNAV 5239 link.

4.  System Access.  Both RED and DA will reside within NSIPS ESR.
For those who have not established an ESR self-service account as directed in 
reference (a), establish an ESR self-service account
via:  https://nsipsprod.nmci.navy.mil/ (CAC access required).

5.  Timeline:
    a.  Shore Commands.  The operational test originated with the alpha 
assessment which consisted of two customer commands Personnel Support 
Detachment (PSD) Memphis and PSD Pearl Harbor.
Live operational bravo assessment processing of RED and DA functionality 
began in February 2016 with PSDs Naval Station Norfolk, Little Creek, Great 
Lakes, Naval Base San Diego, Jacksonville, Kings Bay, Memphis, Okinawa, Port 
Hueneme, Navy Operational Support Center (NOSC) Norfolk, NOSC San Diego, and 
350 Customer Commands nominated by their respective Type Commanders.
Following successful operational bravo assessment, RED and DA was expanded on 
17 July 2017 to all customer commands of the aforementioned PSDs.
    b.  Phased Implementation.  Instructor Led Training and site support will 
be led by Mr. John Courtney at PERS-2 for active component and CNRFC N01A 
YNCS Reid and PSC Roettger for Reserve component commands.  Regional site 
support training and schedules will be announced and supported by the above 
representatives and posted on the Commander, Navy Personnel Command 
(COMNAVPERSCOM), Pay and Personnel Support Branch (PERS-2) SharePoint site 
https://mpte.navy.deps.mil/sites/npc/pers2/NPPSC/Training/PSD%20COI%
20CPPA.aspx (CAC access required).  Contact your servicing PSD in your area 
for specific date and time for scheduled training.  On- line training in the 
form of Job Performance Aids is also available on the NSIPS splash page at 
https://nsipsprod.nmci.navy.mil/ (CAC access required).
