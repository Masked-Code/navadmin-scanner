AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 5760.5C, NAVY SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE TO YOUTH 
GROUPS.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES AMPLIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT THE MISSION OF 
THE NAVY SEA CADET CORPS (NSCC) AND ENCOURAGES NAVY PERSONNEL TO CONTINUE 
THEIR PROACTIVE SUPPORT IN MENTORING, LEADING, AND DEVELOPING THE FUTURE 
GENERATION OF SEAGOING LEADERS.  THE NSCC IS A NON-PROFIT YOUTH ORGANIZATION 
SPONSORED BY THE NAVY LEAGUE OF THE UNITED STATES.  WITH VOLUNTEER SUPPORT AND 
ASSISTANCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, THE NSCC ENCOURAGES AND EQUIPS 
AMERICAN YOUTH WITH SEAGOING SKILLS WHILE TEACHING THEM PATRIOTISM, COURAGE, 
SELF-RELIANCE AND KINDRED VIRTUES.

2.  INTRODUCING AMERICA'S NAVY TO TODAY'S YOUTH IS KEY, AND THE NSCC'S 
GREATEST CONTINUAL NEED IS FOR QUALIFIED ADULT LEADERS AND TRAINING 
OPPORTUNITIES ON BOARD SHIPS, BASES AND STATIONS.  OUR INVOLVEMENT AND SUPPORT 
OF THE NSCC CAN DIRECTLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE READINESS OF AMERICA'S 
NAVY AS A GLOBAL FORCE FOR GOOD.
THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS THE NAVY CAN IMPROVE OUR RELATIONSHIP AND INTERACTION 
WITH THE NSCC.
    A.  MENTORSHIP:  THE NSCC PROVIDES SAILORS WITH A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY 
TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THE LIVES OF YOUTH AGES 11 THROUGH

17.  WITH OVER 400 UNITS THROUGHOUT CONUS, GUAM AND PUERTO RICO, THERE IS 
ALWAYS A SEA CADET UNIT NEARBY THAT WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM INTERACTION 
WITH NAVY SAILORS.  WHILE POSITIONS AS ADULT LEADERS MAY BE AVAILABLE AT A 
LOCAL NSCC UNIT, ANY TIME THAT SAILORS CAN DEDICATE TO SUPPORT THE TRAINING OF 
CADETS IS WELCOMED AND GREATLY APPRECIATED BY THE NSCC.  SIMPLY SERVING AS A 
GUEST SPEAKER AT A CADET DRILL PERIOD SHARING REAL LIFE NAVY EXPERIENCES AND 
OPPORTUNITIES BENEFITS CADETS.  IN ADDITION, PROVIDING MENTORSHIP AND TRAINING 
TO CADETS DURING ONE OF THE NSCC'S FLAGSHIP SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING 
AND MATH EDUCATION PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE SEA PERCH UNDERWATER REMOTELY 
OPERATED VEHICLE PROGRAM SPONSORED BY THE OFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH, HELPS TO 
FURTHER THE NSCC MISSION.
    B.  REFERRALS:  WHILE THE NSCC IS NOT A RECRUITING PROGRAM FOR THE NAVY, 
THE NSCC OFFERS TEENS THE TRAINING AND REAL-LIFE EXPERIENCES THAT CAN BEST 
PREPARE THEM FOR SERVICE IN THE MILITARY.
SAILORS THAT COME INTO CONTACT WITH TEENS LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO RECEIVE 
TRAINING SHOULD BE REFERRED TO THE POINT OF CONTACT IN PARA 4.

3.  NAVY UNITS, COMMANDS AND ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS MOTIVATED PERSONNEL WHO 
ARE INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH OUR FUTURE LEADERS MAY SUPPORT SEA CADET UNITS.  
OPERATIONAL COMMANDS MAY INVITE NSCC UNITS TO TRAIN ON BOARD AS SCHEDULES 
PERMIT.  REF A PROVIDES GUIDANCE CONCERNING COMMAND ASSISTANCE TO THE NSCC.

4.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE NSCC, CONTACT THE NSCC PROGRAM MANAGER, 
NAVY RECRUITING COMMAND, AT (901) 874-9131.
