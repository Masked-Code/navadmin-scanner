RMKS/1. OCTOBER IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH. BEGINNING AS A DAY OF 
UNITY OBSERVATION IN OCTOBER 1981, THE OBSERVANCE GREW INTO THE FIRST DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH IN OCTOBER 1987.
THE OBSERVANCE GIVES US BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
AWARENESS AND TO INFORM OUR SAILORS AND NAVY SPOUSES ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
PREVENTION EFFORTS AND REPORTING OPTIONS FOR VICTIMS. THIS YEAR'S THEME IS: 
"HOME IS NOT A WARZONE:  BRINGING PEACE TO RELATIONSHIPS."

2. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CUTS ACROSS ALL AGE GROUPS AND RANKS. IT HAPPENS TO 
SAILORS AS WELL AS SPOUSES; TO MEN AS WELL AS WOMEN.  THE ACT OF VIOLENCE CAN 
GO BEYOND PHYSICAL ABUSE. IT CAN BE EMOTIONAL ABUSE AS WELL.

3. IN ADDITION TO AWARENESS, OUR FOCUS MUST ALSO BE ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
EDUCATION AND PREVENTION. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF COURSES THAT TEACH HEALTHY 
RELATIONSHIP SKILLS AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE AT OUR FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT 
CENTERS. IF YOU NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE, LICENSED COUNSELORS ARE AVAILABLE 
FREE OF CHARGE. THESE SERVICES ARE OPEN TO ALL ACTIVE DUTY AND THEIR FAMILY 
MEMBERS - EVEN SAILORS WHO ARE UNMARRIED CAN HAVE COUPLES COUNSELING. MAKING 
AN APPOINTMENT FOR COUNSELING IS A SMART MOVE AND DOES NOT HARM ONES CAREER OR 
SECURITY CLEARANCE. OUR SAILORS AND THEIR SPOUSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO SEEK HELP 
BEFORE A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENT OCCURS.

4. IF YOU ARE IN NEED OF HELP OR KNOW OF A SHIPMATE OR FAMILY MEMBER THAT 
NEEDS HELP, DO NOT STAY SILENT AND DO NOT WAIT; PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION 
PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE. THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY IS 
VERY IMPORTANT TO US. OUR NAVY IS ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO STRENGTHENING 
FAMILIES AND PREVENTING ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR.
FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND RESOURCES ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION, 
EDUCATION, AND AWARENESS, THE NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOTLINE IS AVAILABLE 
AT 1-800-799-SAFE OR AT YOUR LOCAL FLEET AND FAMILY SERVICE CENTERS AND ON THE 
WEB AT HTTP://WWW.NDVH.ORG/.
