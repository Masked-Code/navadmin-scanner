2.  AS ALWAYS, COMPETITION FOR REDESIGNATION WAS KEEN, AND EVERY 
COMMUNITY HAD A POOL OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES TO SELECT FROM.  THE 
BOARD PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING LESSONS LEARNED: 
    A.  SUSTAINED SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE AND RELEVANT EXPERIENCE WERE 
CRITICAL TO SELECTION.  THOSE OFFICERS WHO HAD INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION 
(IA) EXPERIENCE FARED WELL BEFORE THIS BOARD.  RESULTS REFLECTED THE 
HIGH VALUE NAVY PLACES ON THE IA MISSION AND THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE. 
    B.  SEEK SPONSORSHIP.  GAINING COMMUNITY ENDORSEMENT AND EVIDENCE OF 
A CANDIDATE S PROACTIVE EFFORT IN SEEKING GAINING COMMUNITY MENTORSHIP 
WERE HIGHLY FAVORABLE ELEMENTS IN MAKING A RECORD MORE COMPETITIVE. 
    C.  COMMUNICATE YOUR SELECTABILITY.  FAMILIARITY AND UNDERSTANDING 
THE COMMUNITY TO WHICH YOU DESIRE TO REDESIGNATE SHOULD ASSIST YOUR 
PREPARATION IN DEVELOPING A LOGICAL, RELEVANT RECORD FOR BOARD 
EVALUATION.  BEYOND THE MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS, YOUR PACKAGE SHOULD 
EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE EXPERIENCE, SKILLS, EDUCATION, AND SENIOR 
SPONSORSHIP. 
    D.  KEEP TRYING.  REDESIGNATION OPPORTUNITIES ARE DRIVEN BY QUOTAS 
THAT ARE AUTHORIZED FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL BOARD.  IF NOT SELECTED, 
RE-APPLY AND KEEP WORKING TO IMPROVE IN THOSE SKILLS RELEVANT TO THE 
DESIRED REDESIGNATION COMMUNITY.  ALSO, REVIEW THE BOARD PRECEPT TO 
DETERMINE IF NON-SELECTION WAS DUE TO YEAR GROUP QUOTA RESTRICTIONS.

3.  ELIGIBLE OFFICERS NOT INITIALLY SELECTED FOR THEIR PRIMARY OR 
SECONDARY CHOICE WERE SUBSEQUENTLY REVIEWED BY ALL OTHER COMMUNITIES FOR 
CONSIDERATION.  OFFICERS TENTATIVELY SELECTED FOR COMMUNITIES NOT 
INITIALLY REQUESTED WILL BE NOTIFIED VIA OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE AND 
OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDESIGNATE. 

4.  THIS MSG IS NOT AUTHORITY TO DELIVER CHANGE OF DESIGNATOR LETTER TO

MADE AVAILABLE TO THEIR NEW COMMUNITY, WILL FORWARD A REDESIGNATION LTR 
TO THE SELECTEE OR APPOINTMENT ACCEPTANCE AND OATH OF OFFICE (NAVPERS 
1000/4), AS APPLICABLE. 
    B.  OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT PROMOTION SELECTEES AND WHO ARE NOT UNDER 
ORDERS CAN EXPECT ASSIGNMENT TO A BILLET APPROPRIATE TO THEIR NEW 
DESIGNATOR WHEN NOTIFIED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4). 
    C.  IF A MEMBER IS CURRENTLY UNDER ORDERS AND TRANSFERS PRIOR TO 
NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4), MEMBER MUST EXECUTE ORDERS UNDER 
CURRENT DESIGNATOR AND COMPLETE 12 MONTHS IN THE NEW ASSIGNMENT, UNLESS 
A SHORTER TOUR IS PRESCRIBED (TOURS IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR WILL BE WITH 
THE CONCURRENCE OF THE GAINING COMMUNITY), PRIOR TO REDESIGNATION. 

5.  THE FOLLOWING ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE POLICY IN PARAGRAPH 4C: 
    A.  SURFACE WARFARE (11XX) OFFICERS WHO ARE UNDER ORDERS TO 
DEPARTMENT HEAD SCHOOL MAY NOT LATERALLY TRANSFER UNTIL COMPLETION OF 
INITIAL DEPARTMENT HEAD TOUR. 
    B.  AVIATION OFFICERS SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED TO LATERAL TRANSFER

    C.  ANY APPLICANT FOR 1510 WHO IS PRESENTLY DESIGNATED 131X OR 132X 
AND IS ELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION BEFORE THE BOARD MAY BE REDESIGNATED 
1510 IN ACCORDANCE WITH MILPERSMAN 1212-010 IF SELECTED.  IF A SECOND

ASSIGNMENT TO 1510 BILLETS MAY BE DELAYED UNTIL THE COMPLETION OF 
APPLICABLE SECOND SEA OR AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD TOUR AS DETERMINED BY 
COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-43).

7.  THE NEXT TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION BOARD WILL CONVENE 11 JUN 07.
