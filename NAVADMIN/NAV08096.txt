REF/B/GENADMIN/TASK FORCE LIFE/WORK UPDATE/14AUG07// NARR/REF A 
ESTABLISHED TFLW TO DEVELOP, CREATE AND IMPLEMENT WAYS TO BETTER INFUSE 
LIFE/WORK BALANCE INTO SAILOR' LIVES.  REF B PROVIDED THE TFLW ROADSHOW 
SCHEDULE AND WEBSITE ACCESS TO THE TFLW GOOGLE BLOG SITE TO CONTRIBUTE 
FEEDBACK.// RMKS/1.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS NAVADMIN IS TO CLOSE OUT THE 
ASSESSMENT PHASE OF TFLW AND MAP OUT THE WAY AHEAD FOR CONTINUING 
ACTION.  WHEN WE STOOD UP TASK FORCE LIFE/WORK (TFLW) IN JUNE, I 
PROMISED TO KEEP YOU UPDATED ON THIS TEAM'S IMPORTANT WORK.  CNO 
CHALLENGED TFLW TO EXAMINE THE POLICIES, PROGRAMS, AND CHANGES THAT 
HOLD REAL POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE OUR SAILOR'S LIFE/WORK BALANCE.  OUR 
OBJECTIVES WERE TO SOLICIT FLEET FEEDBACK FOR IDEAS AND RECOMMENDATIONS, 
EXAMINE INITIATIVES WE COULD INFLUENCE THROUGH POLICY CHANGE, AND 
IDENTIFY EFFORTS THAT REQUIRE DOD/CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL FOR ENGAGEMENT.
-.  BEFORE SUMMARIZING TFLW PROGRESS, I WANT TO SET THE CORRECT FRAME 
OF REFERENCE WHEN DISCUSSING TFLW INITIATIVES:  I FULLY REALIZE MANY OF 
THESE LIFE/WORK BALANCE ENHANCEMENTS MAY NOT DIRECTLY APPLY TO THE 
OPERATIONAL FLEET.  LIFE ON THE TIP OF THE SPEAR IS DEMANDING, AND 
IDEAS SUCH AS TELECOMMUTING OR MORE FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULES MAY NOT BE 
POSSIBLE FOR CERTAIN UNITS.  THERE ARE, HOWEVER, MANY WAYS COMMANDS CAN 
SUPPORT LIFE/WORK BALANCE FOR SAILORS WHILE WORKING WITHIN THEIR 
OPERATIONAL CONFINES.  IF YOUR COMMAND HAS INSTITUTED INNOVATIVE QOL 
PROGRAMS THAT WORK WITHIN YOUR DEMANDING OPERATIONAL SCHEDULE, WE WANT 
TO HEAR FROM YOU.  TAKE A MOMENT TO BRAG AND SEND YOUR INITIATIVES TO 
MY POC'S BELOW.
3.  IN PHASE I OF ASSESSMENT/DISCOVERY, YOUR SUPPORT OF TFLW ROADSHOWS 
ENABLED US TO REACH OVER 11,000 SAILORS IN SAN DIEGO, JACKSONVILLE/ 
KINGS BAY, NORFOLK, HAWAII, PACNORWEST, AND FDNF.  TOGETHER WITH 
FEEDBACK FROM OUR TFLW ONLINE COMMUNITY (THE FIRST EVER NAVY-SPONSORED 
BLOG), MY TEAM PROCESSED OVER 3,500 COMMENTS RELATING TO LIFE/WORK 
BALANCE.  THIS FEEDBACK WAS INSIGHTFUL AND ON TARGET, PROVIDING ME MANY 
SUBSTANTIVE IDEAS TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE AND PUSH TOWARDS 
IMPLEMENTATION.
4.  IN PHASE II, CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT AND LEADERSHIP AWARENESS, WE 
CATEGORIZED FEEDBACK INTO FOUR DISTINCT AREAS.  QUALITY OF WORK (QOW) 
(40 PERCENT), QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) (30 PERCENT), FINANCIAL (20 
PERCENT), AND EDUCATION (10 PERCENT).  WITHIN QOW, OPTEMPO AND 
TRAINING/ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS WERE CONSISTENTLY RANKED AS TOP 
PRIORITIES, FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY IA ASSIGNMENT ISSUES AMONG OUR JUNIOR 
OFFICERS.  IN QOL, FEEDBACK CONCENTRATED ON GEOGRAPHIC STABILITY, 
PATERNITY LEAVE, THE NEED FOR MORE FLEXIBLE CHILDCARE AND ALTERNATIVE 
WORK OPTIONS.  TUITION ASSISTANCE AND MONTGOMERY GI BILL 
TRANSFERABILITY DOMINATED THE EDUCATION FIELD (TAKEN SINGULARLY, MGIB 
TRANSFERABILITY WAS ONE OF THE TOP ISSUES OVERALL).  LASTLY, FEEDBACK 
IN THE FINANCIAL CATEGORY FOCUSED ON PAY, BONUSES, AND POSSIBLE THRIFT 
SAVINGS PLAN (TSP) ENHANCEMENTS.
5.  IN TFLW PHASE III, CONTINUING ACTION, WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY TO 
ADDRESSING MANY OF THE ISSUES ABOVE.  LAST JUNE, I SIGNED THE NEW 
PREGNANCY AND PARENTHOOD INSTRUCTION, AUTHORIZING THREE WEEKS OF 
ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE FOR ADOPTIVE PARENTS AND EXTENDED OPERATIONAL 
DEFERMENT FOR NEW MOTHERS FROM 4 TO 12.  WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH DOD/ 
CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP TO AUTHORIZE PATERNITY LEAVE, WHICH WOULD 
GRANT THREE WEEKS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE TO NATURAL FATHERS, AND ARE 
WORKING WITH CNIC TO DEVELOP MORE FLEXIBLE CHILDCARE OPTIONS TO SUPPORT 
MILITARY WORKDAY REALITIES.
6.  AFTER A SUCCESSFUL PILOT PROGRAM, WE EXPANDED THE OPNAV N1 
TELECOMMUTING PROGRAM TO MY ENTIRE MPTE STAFF BOTH IN WASHINGTON AND 
MILLINGTON, ALLOWING MEMBERS TO TELECOMMUTE FROM HOME UP TO TWO TIMES A 
WEEK WHILE REMAINING FULLY CONNECTED TO THE WORKPLACE.  THE JAG 
COMMUNITY HAS ALSO JOINED THIS EFFORT AND WE PLAN ON AUTHORIZING A 
TELECOMMUTING OPNAVINST FOR FLEET IMPLEMENTATION THIS SUMMER.
7.  OUR CAREER INTERMISSION PILOT PROGRAM (AKA "OFF-ON RAMP") HAS 
RECENTLY BEEN APPROVED BY OMB FOR CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW THIS FALL.  
THIS PILOT WILL ALLOW BOTH OFFICERS AND ENLISTED TO "OFF-RAMP" FROM AC 
TO RC FOR UP TO THREE YEARS WHILE MAINTAINING HEALTH CARE BENEFITS, A 
MONTHLY STIPEND, AND A PCS MOVE TO A CONUS LOCATION OF THEIR CHOICE AND 
BACK AT THE END OF THE OFF-RAMP.  THIS PROGRAM HAS THE FULL SUPPORT OF 
DOD, AND WILL SERVE AS A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR ALL SERVICES.
8.  BOTH EXPANDED FUNDING FOR SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS AND MGIB 
TRANSFERABILITY WERE RECOGNIZED RECENTLY BY DOD AND THE WHITE HOUSE 
DURING THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS.  OUR TFLW FEEDBACK AND RESEARCH 
ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE RECENT BILL SUBMITTED IN THE SENATE ON MGIB 
TRANSFERABILITY WHICH ALREADY HAS MORE THAN 22 BI-PARTISAN SIGNATURES 
AND HAS GAINED TREMENDOUS MOMENTUM ON THE HILL.
9.  OTHER PHASE III INITIATIVES WILL FOCUS ON REESTABLISHING THE 
ENLISTED EDUCATION ADVANCEMENT PROGRAM (EEAP), CREATING VIRTUAL 
COMMANDS TO IMPROVE GEOGRAPHIC STABILITY, SOCIAL ENTERPRISE FELLOWSHIPS, 
A PART-TIME PAY FOR PART-TIME WORK PILOT PROGRAM, AND LEADERSHIP 
RECOGNITION PROGRAMS FOR THOSE COMMANDING OFFICERS DEMONSTRATING 
OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP IN THE FIELD OF LIFE/WORK INTEGRATION THROUGH 
OUR CNO'S "TOP 50" AWARD EFFORT.
10.  WHILE THESE AND OTHER TFLW EFFORTS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE 
TO

IMPROVING THE LIFE/WORK BALANCE OF OUR SAILORS, WE FULLY RECOGNIZE THAT 
OPERATIONAL MISSION REQUIREMENTS PLACED ON SAILORS MUST BE MET.  LET ME 
BE VERY CLEAR - IT IS MY FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF THAT WE WILL HAVE TO ADAPT 
HOW WE DO BUSINESS WITH OUR PEOPLE TO REACH AND KEEP THE NEXT 
GENERATION

OF SAILORS.  THE CHANGING NATIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS AND GENERATIONAL 
DIFFERENCES WE SEE REFLECTED IN OUR NAVY DEMAND THESE CHANGES.  FOR OUR 
NAVY TO COMPETE AND WIN THE BATTLE FOR TALENT, WE MUST POSITION 
OURSELVES TO BE A "TOP 50" EMPLOYER OF CHOICE.  
11.  REMEMBER, WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR THE EASY BUTTON, BUT THE BETTER 
BUTTON;  WE?RE MAKING PROGRESS BUT YOUR THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, AND VISION 
ARE ESSENTIAL TO KEEPING THIS INITIATIVE ON TRACK.  THE TFLW ROADSHOW 
EVENTS REVEALED STORIES OF CREATIVE LIFE/WORK BALANCE PRACTICES ALREADY 
IN PLACE AT MANY INDIVIDUAL COMMANDS.  THESE LEADERSHIP INITIATIVES ARE 
THE CATALYST FOR MORE DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.  PLEASE REPORT 
YOUR

BEST PRACTICES TO THE TASK FORCE TO HELP CAPITALIZE ON LESSONS LEARNED.
