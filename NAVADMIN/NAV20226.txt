RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides information regarding Naval Additive 
Manufacturing (AM) capabilities and provides steps to obtain Navy Organic AM 
produced parts and supplies.  While still an evolving option for Navy Supply 
chains, AM has continued to mature and is in use by the Department of the 
Navy.  Items ranging from repair parts to consumable supplies have already 
been produced and provided to the Fleet.  While the list of approved AM parts 
continues to grow, the current list can be found at the Joint Technical Data 
Integration (JTDI) Website:  https://www.jtdi.mil.  Navy AM capability 
currently produces parts made from polymer, composite materials and metal. 
 
2.  The process to obtain AM produced parts or supplies is also evolving and 
may differ across United States Navy Systems Commands (SYSCOM)/production 
sites.  The steps provided in this NAVADMIN are intended to be integrated 
with existing supply/maintenance processes.  An appropriate path forward to 
meet technical requirements will be recommended by the SYSCOM point of 
contact (POC).  If AM is determined to be a capable path for production and 
meets requestor requirements such as timeline and budget, SYSCOM POC will 
connect requestor with production coordinator for a designated production 
site(s).  AM pricing and lead time may vary from pricing via normal supply 
chain options.  Units requiring AM support for parts or supplies should: 
    a.  If applicable, coordinate with 3MC/Maintenance Department to ensure 
    maintenance actions are performed and tracked in accordance with 
reference(c). 
    b.  Contact SYSCOM POC responsible for the equipment associated with the 
    required item to discuss AM options and ensure compliance with SYSCOM 
specific policy per references (d) through (g) or other applicable 
guidance/updates.  A form with requested information is available on the JTDI 
website and includes information such as part number, national item 
identification number, drawing, applicable system, component location, 
material requirements, and performance requirements.  SYSCOM contact 
information is provided below. 
    c.  Send a demand only military standard requisitioning and issue 
procedures to Navy enterprise resource planning (MILSTRIP) to ensure the item 
manager can track the demand signal.  For non-national stock number (NSN) AM 
fabricated items, the supply department shall submit a MILSTRIP BHJ to report 
the fabrication of non-NSN material.  For NSN AM fabricated material, the 
supply department shall submit a MILSTRIP DHA to report the fabrication of 
NSN material. 
    d.  Coordinate with the identified SYSCOM production coordinator provided 
by the SYSCOM POC. 
 
3.  For AM items with AM NSNs established, standard requisition policy should 
be followed in accordance with reference (h).  If off-hull, I-level or above 
assistance is required for compliant fabrication of an item, standard 
procedures for this process should be followed. 
 
4.  Unless other existing procedures/work orders or support arrangements are 
available, obtaining AM items fabricated via the organic industrial base 
(OIB) above the unit-level can be funded via a DD1149 or DD1348 with a line 
of accounting.  Units should use appropriate funding in accordance with 
standard requisition policy.  Questions regarding fiscal policy should be 
directed to your local comptroller.  Rough order of magnitude cost, schedule 
and funding documents will be coordinated directly between the SYSCOM POC and 
the requestor. 
 
5.  For questions, please contact your SYSCOM POC: 
    a.  NAVSEA:  NAVSEA_AM@navy.mil 
    b.  NAVAIR:  NAVAIR_AM.fct@navy.mil 
    c.  NAVFAC or NECF:  NAVFAC_NECF_AM@navy.mil 
    d.  Other SYSCOM:  NavyAM@navy.mil
