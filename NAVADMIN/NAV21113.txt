        (2) Commercial collaboration capabilities with a DoD Provisional 
Authorization must be approved by OPNAV N2N6 prior to procurement and 
use.  Submit requests in accordance with paragraph 4. 
    c.  If the collaboration capabilities listed in paragraphs 2.a. and 2.b 
do not provide sufficient data protection or functionality, commands may 
request OPNAV N2N6 approval to use other commercial collaboration 
capabilities.  Submit requests in accordance with paragraph 4. 
    d.  The Naval Postgraduate School, Naval War College, and United States 
Naval Academy may continue to use authorized commercial collaboration tools 
on 
Navy Higher Education Networks.

not

authorization.

Framework (RMF) ATO will stop using the tool immediately. 
 
3.  When using approved collaboration tools accessed via web browser (GFE and 
personal devices): 
    a.  The user shall not discuss information that is not publicly 
releasable (e.g., CUI) unless the collaboration tool has been authorized to 
store, process, and transmit the level of information being presented or 
discussed. 
        (1) The collaboration tool does not require software to be downloaded 
and installed. 
        (2) The collaboration tool is not blocked by DoD/Navy security

the type of data that will be stored, processed, or transmitted and the types 
of participants (e.g. government, industry, foreign partner). 
    c.  Detail why Microsoft Teams and approved DoD collaboration 
capabilities 
do not meet data protection or functional requirements. 
    d.  Identify the proposed alternative collaboration capability including 
the data protection level it has been authorized for and whether it has an 
existing DoD PATO or RMF ATO. 
    e.  Provide a plan to meet DoD cybersecurity requirements and achieve an 
RMF ATO (reference (d)).  Additional information at:
