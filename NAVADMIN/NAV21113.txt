RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance on the Navys use of collaboration 
tools. 
 
2.  Navy Approved Collaboration Capabilities. 
    a.  Microsoft Teams is the Department of Defense (DoD) collaboration 
standard and will be provided in FLANK SPEED, the Navys approved M365 cloud 
(reference a).  Additional FLANK SPEED information available at https 
://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs/OPNAV/N2N6/DDCION/FlankSpeed 
        1) The FLANK SPEED Authority to Operate (ATO) permits processing and 
storage of controlled unclassified information (CUI) data types, as listed in 
DoDI 5200.48, up to moderate impact Personally Identifiable Information 
(PII).  All policies for handling permitted CUI data types still apply. 
        2) The following data type exceptions are not authorized on FLANK 
SPEED: 
           (a) Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
information, to include Protected Health Information (PHI) 
           (b) Navy Nuclear Propulsion Information (NNPI) 
           (c) Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) data 
        3) Authorization for data types in paragraph 5.a.2 are planned as 
part of future capability releases.  Users will be notified when these data 
types are authorized. 
    b.  If Microsoft Teams does not provide sufficient data protection or 
functionality, Navy users will use approved DoD Enterprise Collaboration 
Capabilities. 
        1) Approved DoD Enterprise Collaboration Capabilities are listed at: 
https://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs/DUSNM/DONCIO/SitePages/DON%20CIO%20Telewo
rk%20Guidance.aspx 
        2) Commercial collaboration capabilities with a DoD Provisional 
Authorization must be approved by OPNAV N2N6 prior to procurement and 
use.  Submit requests in accordance with paragraph 7. 
    c.  If the collaboration capabilities listed in para 4.b. do not provide 
sufficient data protection or functionality, commands may request OPNAV N2N6 
approval to use other commercial collaboration capabilities.  Submit requests 
in accordance with paragraph 7. 
    d.  The Naval Postgraduate School, Naval War College, and United States 
Naval Academy may continue to use authorized commercial collaboration tools 
on Navy Higher Education Networks. 
    e.  Commercial collaboration capabilities software or applications will 
not be installed on any government furnished equipment (GFE) without 
authorization. 
    f.  Commands using a commercial collaboration tool without a Risk 
Management Framework (RMF) ATO will stop using the tool immediately. 
 
3.  When using approved collaboration tools accessed via web browser (GFE and 
personal devices): 
    a.  The user shall not discuss information that is not publicly 
releasable (e.g., CUI) unless the collaboration tool has been authorized to 
store, process, and transmit the level of information being presented or 
discussed 
        1) The collaboration tool does not require software to be downloaded 
and installed. 
        2) The collaboration tool is not blocked by DoD/Navy security policy. 
    b.  Per reference (b), Navy personnel may participate in contractor-
hosted collaboration sessions involving CUI if the Contractor has complied 
with 252.204-7012 (Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber 
Incident Reporting).  By hosting the session, contractors are asserting that 
the collaboration tool meets the security requirements for handling the 
appropriate level of CUI. 
 
4.  Requests for approval of an alternate collaboration capability will: 
    a.  Be submitted by the first flag officer or SES in the chain of command 
and endorsed by the cognizant Echelon II Command Information Officer. 
    b.  Describe the intended use of the collaboration capability including 
the type of data that will be stored, processed, or transmitted and the types 
of participants (e.g. government, industry, foreign partner). 
    c.  Detail why Microsoft Teams and approved DoD collaboration 
capabilities do not meet data protection or functional requirements. 
    d.  Identify the proposed alternative collaboration capability including 
the data protection level it has been authorized for and whether it has an 
existing DoD PATO or RMF ATO. 
    e.  Provide a plan to meet DoD cybersecurity requirements and achieve an 
RMF ATO (reference c).  Additional information at: 
https://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs/OPNAV/N2N6/DDCION/N2N6BC4/RMF 
    f.  Be provided to the POCs listed above.

for operational use.  Any requests to exclude website from the block list 
will be submitted by the Echelon II Command Information Officer and submitted 
using the online web form in accordance with reference (d) at:  https
