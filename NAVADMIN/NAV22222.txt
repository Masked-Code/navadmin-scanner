RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and announces an updated Naval 
Special Operations (NSO) Senior Enlisted Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) 
Technician Retention Bonus (RB) program. 
 
2.  Program Overview.  This bonus is authorized under references (b) 
through (d).  Specific critical Navy enlisted classifications (NEC) and 
approved award levels have been prescribed in reference (d). The NSO EOD 
Enlisted Community Manager (BUPERS-329) will act as the NSO EOD RB Program 
Manager.  All applications for this bonus will be submitted to the program 
manager for processing and tracking.  By law, Sailors may receive no more 
than 360,000 dollars in RB monies over a career.  Selective reenlistment 
bonus awards are included in that cap.  Within the confines of reference (d), 
the eligibility criteria stated in this NAVADMIN may be changed by the 
program manager based on the needs of the EOD community, with the approval 
of the Director, Military Personnel Plans and Policy (OPNAV N13).

action, NEC removal, or restoration will be held in abeyance pending final

Sailor of the uniformed services who enters into a written agreement with 
specified service conditions for receipt of a bonus is entitled to the full 
amount of the bonus if the Sailor fulfills the condition of that written 
agreement.  If the Sailor fails to fulfill the service conditions specified 
in the written agreement for pay, then the pay may be terminated, and the 
Sailor may be required to repay an amount equal to the unearned portion of 
the pay.
