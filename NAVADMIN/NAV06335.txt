RMKS/1.  THE PRESIDENTIAL CLASSROOM PROGRAM IS SOLICITING NOMINATIONS 
FOR VOLUNTEER INSTRUCTORS FOR THE 2007 PROGRAM. THE PRESIDENTIAL 
CLASSROOM IS A NON-PARTISAN, EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES THE 
NATION'S MOST PROMISING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
PARTICIPATE IN A DYNAMIC STUDY OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND CURRENT 
ISSUES. THE PROGRAM RELIES ON VOLUNTEER INSTRUCTORS FROM GOVERNMENT 
AGENCIES WHO CONTRIBUTE A FULL WEEK OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL 
TIME TO THE EFFORT.
2. THE SELECTED INSTRUCTORS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PROFESSIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT AND A CHANCE TO ENHANCE LEADERSHIP SKILLS AS THEY HELP HIGH 
SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY EXPLORE THE INNER WORKINGS OF 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. INSTRUCTORS ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK 
CLOSELY WITH COLLEAGUES FROM OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES AND DEVELOP 
VALUABLE PROFESSIONAL CONTACTS OF THEIR OWN.
ESCORT OFFICERS INTERACT DIRECTLY WITH THE STUDENTS AND, AS THIS IS 
OFTEN THE FIRST EXPOSURE TO THE MILITARY FOR MANY OF THE STUDENTS, MUST 
EPITOMIZE NAVY CORE VALUES AND SERVE AS ROLE MODELS WITHIN THEIR 
COMMUNITY.  ESCORT OFFICERS MUST BE CAREER-ORIENTED, PRESENT EXEMPLARY 
PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL APPEARANCE, BE FAMILIAR WITH THE ROLES AND 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE US GOVERNMENT, AND BE WELL VERSED IN FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT AND DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY CURRENT EVENTS.
3. INSTRUCTORS VOLUNTEER FOR ONE WEEK OUT OF THE 15 SCHEDULED PROGRAM 
WEEKS. THE WEEKS FOR THE WINTER SESSION ARE 4 FEBRUARY THROUGH 31 MARCH 
2007, AND THE WEEKS FOR THE SPRING SESSION ARE 10 JUNE THROUGH 28 JULY 
2007. MILITARY MEMBERS MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR PERMISSIVE TAD ORDERS TO 
PARTICIPATE IN PRESIDENTIAL CLASSROOM.
4. EACH PARTICIPANT MUST ATTEND A TRAINING SESSION, FULLY PARTICIPATE 
IN THE WEEK-LONG PROGRAM AND RESIDE AT THE GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY 
CONFERENCE CENTER THROUGHOUT THE WEEK (AT NO COST TO THE VOLUNTEER OR 
TO THE COMMAND). ESCORT OFFICERS MUST BE COMPLETELY AVAILABLE FOR THE 
DURATION OF THE PROGRAM. THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WORK ON OTHER 
PROJECTS OR ATTEND TO PERSONAL MATTERS.
