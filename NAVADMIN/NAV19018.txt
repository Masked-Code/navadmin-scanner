RMKS/1.  Campaign Drug Free (CDF) is one of six Flagship Programs within the 
Navy Community Service Program.  Sailors and Marines who volunteer have a 
profound impact by promoting drug demand reduction programs to schools, 
organizations, and communities to address youth on the dangers of drug abuse 
and the importance of being drug free.  They strengthen their communities 
through education, promoting health and fitness, encouraging alternatives to 
drug use, and promoting anti-drug lifestyles.  Per reference (a), Commander, 
Navy Reserve Force is the Flagship Sponsor for CDF, and each year the Navy 
recognizes the best programs that teach elementary, middle, and high school 
children about the dangers of drug abuse in their communities.  These 
exemplary outreach programs have effectively reduced drug and alcohol abuse 
by children through outreach programs and education.  In addition, by 
participating in community service projects, volunteers reinforce the Navy 
Core Values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment as a means to further 
leadership and character development.

2.  It is a great pleasure to announce the 2018 Campaign Drug Free Flagship 
Award winning commands:

    c.  Large Shore:  Naval Air Technical Training Center, Pensacola, FL

3.  Throughout our Navy, command and individual participation in CDF improves 
the communities in which they serve and demonstrates the sense of community 
responsibility of our Sailors, Marines, and Civilians.  As ambassadors to our 
communities, these volunteers display our commitment to improving the lives 
of those we protect and strengthen our espirit de corps.  I offer my 
congratulations to the 2018 award winners and my sincere appreciation to each 
one of you who serve.
