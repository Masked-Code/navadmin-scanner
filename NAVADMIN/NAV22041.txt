RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN directs active and reserve commanders, commanding 
officers and officers-in-charge in line with reference (a) to implement the 
Web Drug Testing Program (Web DTP) or Drug Testing Program (DTP) Lite as the 
primary application to conduct command urinalysis selection, collection, and 
transportation of urine specimen samples in line with reference (b) 
guidelines. Implementing these applications immediately allows Department of 
Defense (DoD) to fully deploy the Specimen Custody Document-Drug Testing (DD 
Form 2624) and a new bottle label system.  Additionally, DD Form 2624 will be 
maintained at the testing command and are no longer required to accompany the 
shipment of urine specimen bottles. This will significantly reduce chain of 
custody and labels discrepancies. 
 
2.  Web DTP will replace the Navy Drug Screening Program (NDSP) v5.4k.  DTP 
Lite will be the only desktop application used when access to Web DTP is not 
available.  Deployed units with limited connectivity to download DTP Lite, 
limited access to Web DTP or activities still undergoing DTP Lite 
certification testing may continue to use NDSP v5.4k.  However, NDSP will be 
removed from the Allowance Parts List/Allowance Equipage List on or about 23 
July 2022.  Contact your local Network Administrator for assistance with 
installing DTP Lite on designated workstations/laptops. 
 
3.  Effective 23 July 2022, any specimen received at any drug laboratory 
using NDSP will not be tested and will receive a fatal discrepancy code as 
stated in reference (a). 
 
4.  Web DTP and DTP Lite applications and user guidance are located on the 
Internet Forensic Toxicology Drug Testing Laboratory Portal 
at https://ftdtl.health.mil/.  As directed in reference (c), Navy Marine 
Corps Internet users are directed to use Web DTP. 
 
5.  Commanders unable to immediately transition to Web DTP or DTP Lite shall 
notify Director, 21st Century Sailor Office (OPNAV N17) the 22nd of each 
month via their Echelon II commanders beginning 22 February 2022.  If the 
22nd falls on a weekend, reports are due the following Monday.  OPNAV N17 
will track all Navy commands transition and report Navy’s progress to DoD on 
or before 22 July 2022. 
 
6.  For additional support/guidance contact the WebDTP/DTP Lite support desk 
at (901) 874-4204, DSN (312) 882-4204 or e-mail:
