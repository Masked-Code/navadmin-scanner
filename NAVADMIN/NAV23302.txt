SUBJ/Holiday Message// 
 
1. Team Navy, MCPON Honea and I wish you all - our Shipmates and Marines, 
Active Duty and Reserve, our Navy civilians, and our families and friends - a 
very happy, joyous, and safe holiday season. 
 
2. Whether you are serving at home, abroad, or deployed at sea, take pride in 
knowing that you are part of the world's most powerful Navy.  
Every day, through your continued service and sacrifice, our Navy operates 
far forward to preserve the peace, respond in crisis, and win decisively, if 
called. 
 
3. This holiday season, please keep in mind our Shipmates who are standing 
the watch. Because of them, we can enjoy this special time. 
For those forward deployed, you and your loved ones are in our thoughts, and 
we are deeply grateful for all you are doing to underwrite the security and 
prosperity of our Nation. 
 
4. As you relax and recharge, please celebrate responsibly. Take care of 
yourself, take care of your loved ones, and take care of your Shipmates. The 
holidays can be a difficult time for many; never be afraid to reach out and 
help those in need, and if you are struggling, ask for help. Remember that we 
are all connected through our shared identity. Each of us are forged by the 
sea, and serve with honor, courage, and commitment. 
 
5. Thank you for what you do every day for our Navy and our Nation, and pass 
on our thanks to your families, too. Navy readiness is anchored in family 
readiness, and we are grateful for all our incredible Navy families. 
 
6. We are honored to serve alongside you. From our families to yours, we wish 
you a happy holiday season and all the best in the year ahead!
