    a.  All applicants must meet eligibility requirements outlined in 
reference (a) and the spring FY-18 FTS eligibility criteria document:  
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/communitymanagers/reserve/fts/Pages/FTSRedesignationBoard.aspx.  
Specific eligibility requirements are described for each designator and 
aviation community.  General eligibility criteria include projected rotation 
date (PRD), minimum service requirement
(MSR) / active-duty service obligation (ADSO) and aviation bonus
(AvB) / aviation career continuation pay (ACCP) contracts:
        (1) PRD.  Applicants, including reservists on mobilization or recall 
orders, must have a current PRD no later than October 2019.
        (2) MSR/ADSO.  Applicants currently under the MSR incurred upon 
commissioning or an ADSO must have an MSR or ADSO end date prior to April 
2020.
        (3) AvB/ACCP.  Aviation officers with obligated service as a result 
of AvB/ACCP are eligible to apply if the officer will be within 12 months of 
completing AvB/ACCP obligation at the time the board convenes.  Additionally, 
aviation officers with obligated service as a result of AvB/ACCP are eligible 
to apply if the officer will be within 12 months of department head tour PRD 
at the time the board convenes.  Redesignation immediately following a 
department head tour may result in cancellation of AvB, which will be 
adjudicated by Aviation Officer Assignments (PERS-43).
        (4) Failure of Selection (FOS).  AC aviation officers in a 2xFOS 
status for promotion to lieutenant commander (LCDR) are eligible to apply for 
FTS regardless of ADSO or AvB/ACCP contract term, a waiver request is not 
required.  All other AC designators should seek release from their respective 
officer community manager.
    b.  The current YG eligibility matrix will be posted on the FTS 
redesignation website.
    c.  Members who do not meet all eligibility requirements in line with 
reference (a) and the spring FY-18 FTS eligibility criteria document posted 
on the FTS redesignation board website may submit a waiver request with their 
application.  Waiver packages shall include waiver request of the member and 
the endorsement of the commanding officer of the waiver request.  This 
endorsement is separate from any endorsements contained in the 
transfer/redesignation application of the member and shall specifically 
address the eligibility criteria requiring a waiver. Waiver request 
procedures and constraints are described in the eligibility criteria 
document.  An example of a waiver request can be found on the FTS 
redesignation board website listed in paragraph 3a.
    d.  Reserve direct commission officers, limited duty officers and chief 
warrant officers (CWOs) are eligible for the FTS program. All officers 
applying to the FTS officer program shall possess a four year baccalaureate 
degree.  CWOs who are within 6 months of completing their baccalaureate 
degree may apply, but redesignation will not occur until after the degree is 
completed.
    e.  AC officers with a pending or approved resignation are eligible to 
apply.
    f.  AC officers will incur a minimum 2 year FTS obligation, except, and 
as outlined in reference (b), aviators selected for the Fleet Logistics 
Squadron community will incur a 3 year FTS obligation.  All Selected Reserve 
officers will incur a 3 year FTS obligation regardless of community.  All FTS 
obligations will begin upon execution of permanent change of station orders 
to the first FTS duty station of the member.

4.  Application requirements and procedures are provided on the FTS 
redesignation board website listed in paragraph 3a.

5.  Upon approval of the board proceedings, the results of the board will be 
posted on the FTS redesignation board website listed in paragraph 3a.  
Applicants can expect to see the results posted within 45 days of board 
adjournment.  Selectees have 14 calendar days from the date results are 
released to accept or decline FTS transfer/redesignation.
