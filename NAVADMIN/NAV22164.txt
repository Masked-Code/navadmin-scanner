SUBJ/50TH ANNIVERSARY OF Z-GRAM 116, EQUAL RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN 
IN THE NAVY// 
 
RMKS/1. August 7, 2022 marks the 50th year anniversary of the Z-gram 116, an 
all-Navy message from then-Chief of Naval Operations ADM Elmo Zumwalt Jr., 
that declared the Navy would now be guided by truly equitable standards, 
marking a distinct step forward in breaking existing barriers to women in the 
Navy. 
 
2. Z-gram 116 announced the establishment of a task force to review laws, 
policies, and regulations necessary to eliminate inequities and open 
opportunities for women in the Navy.  It directed the Navy take nine concrete 
steps to increase equity and enjoined "all commanding 
officers and others in position of authority" to "ensure that women are 
accorded full trust and responsibility to function in their assigned 
position" and "be guided by standards of duty, performance and discipline 
which are truly equitable." 
 
3. CNO Zumwalt embraced the idea of lifting restrictions placed on women in 
the Navy. "I believe we can do far more than we have in the past in according 
women equal opportunity to contribute their extensive talents and to achieve 
full professional status," he wrote in Z-gram 116. He understood that the end 
of conscription and resulting shift to an all-volunteer force required 
significant shifts in policy and Navy culture. "We must be in a position to 
utilize women's talents," he wrote, "to help us achieve the size Navy we need 
under an all-volunteer force environment." 
 
4. Of the nine concrete steps, CNO Zumwalt first directed the limited entry 
of women into all ratings. Next, he lifted restrictions of women in the 
Chaplain and Medical Staff Corps communities, opened Midshipman opportunities 
at all NJROTC campuses, Joint Colleges, and offered women various paths to 
Flag rank.  Finally, to align with pending legislation and Navy regulations, 
he directed that women be afforded the opportunity to command ashore and to 
serve aboard ships at sea. 
 
5. The Navy counted approximately 9,000 women in its 1972 population, but the 
restrictions of 10 USC 6015, precluding women from serving in ships owing to 
what was commonly known as the "Combat Exclusion Rule." Originally part of 
the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, the statute stated "women 
may not be assigned to duty in vessels or aircraft engaged in combat 
missions." This rule limited the types of jobs available to women and thus 
restricted their opportunities to advance.  Z-Gram 116 worked around 10 USC 
6015 by establishing a pilot program aboard hospital ship USS SANCTUARY (AH 
17), enabling  women to fill a variety of shipboard roles from which they had 
previously been excluded. The first women assigned to SANCTUARY were LTJG Ann 
Kerr and PN3 (Personnelman) Peggy Sue Griffith. They were joined later by 53 
other enlisted women and 14 more officers.  After a Federal judge ruled the 
combat exclusion rule was unconstitutional in 1978, the success of the 
SANCTUARY program influenced Congress' modification of 10 USC 6015, allowing 
women to serve in all Navy auxiliary ships.  The later experience of women 
during the First Gulf War in 1991 led to the law's ultimate repeal in 1993, 
followed directly by the first cadre of women to report aboard aircraft 
carrier USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN 69) in 1994. 
 
6. Z-gram 116 was a significant step forward for women in the Navy. By 
declaring the Navy would now be guided by truly equitable standards, CNO 
Zumwalt emphasized the principle of equality and inclusion that remains a 
core component of our Navy today.  Over the past 50 years, generations of 
women have served in the Navy with honor, courage, and commitment. 
Their skills, professionalism, and pride made the Navy a better force then 
and continue to do so today.  As I look at the nearly 70,000 women in our 
Navy, I see an incredible force of professionals who will help guide us 
through the challenges that lie ahead. 
 
7.  Mission.  Recognize the impact Z-Gram 116 had on equal rights and 
opportunities for women in the Navy and the progress the Navy has made since 
its release in 1972.
