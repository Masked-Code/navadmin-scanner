RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the FY-15 E8/E9 Selection 
Boards for Navy reserve and active-duty personnel.  The reserve board will 
consider personnel serving on active-duty as full time support (FTS) and 
selected reserve (SELRES), to include those serving on voluntary and 
involuntary recall and mobilization orders. 
Mobilized individual ready reserve (IRR) personnel are considered under the 
SELRES requirements for advancement.

2.  Timeline of Events:
    a.  24 October 2013.  Commander, Navy Personnel Command (CNPC)
(PERS-802) compiles and submits initial time-in-rate (TIR) eligibility list 
of candidates to Naval Education and Training Professional Development and 
Technology Center (NETPDTC) (N321). 
    b.  20 November 2013.  E8/E9 Examination Status Verification Reports 
(ESVR) will be accessible by educational services officers
(ESOs) and command designated personnel via NETPDTC's Navy Enlisted 
Advancement System website, https://neasos.cnet.navy.mil/.  
The ESVR is the sole source for E7/E8 TIR eligibility verification and will 
be available as follows:                                    
        (1) Reserve E8/E9:  20 November 2013 - 2 March 2014

Per ref (a), paragraph 102, candidates share equal responsibility with their 
parent command in ensuring their name appears on the selection board 
eligibility list.  If the candidate's name still does not appear on the 
eligibility list after exhausting local resources, contact PERS-802/812 prior 
to the board convening.  Failure to do so may affect approval of Special 
Selection Board (SSB) requests.
    d.  Letter to the Board (LTB) deadlines and selection board convening

3.  Eligibility Criteria:
    a.  Sailors not selected to continue from a senior enlisted continuation 
board (SECB) are ineligible for advancement. 
    b.  Candidates must meet eligibility requirements outlined in ref (a), 
Chapter 2, NLT than 1 November 2013.                    
    c.  Candidates who do not have a recommendation for advancement on their 
most recent chief evaluation shall not be validated.  Evaluations that 
restore a recommendation for advancement must be made available to the 
selection board prior to the board convening date.  Refer to ref (a), 
paragraph 1208 for candidates who lose their advancement recommendation after 
the selection board convenes.
    d.  Terminal eligibility date (TED).  The TED for Cycle 221 is 1 October 
2014.  This date shall be used to compute and determine TIR eligibility per 
ref (a), table 2-2.                  
    e.  Commissioning programs.  Candidates selected for Seaman to Admiral, 
Medical Enlisted Commissioning Program, and Medical Service Corps In-Service 
Procurement Program remain eligible for advancement consideration to senior 
chief and master chief petty officer.  Candidates selected to any other 
officer commissioning programs are ineligible and must be invalidated by 
their command.                                                            
    f.  High year tenure (HYT).  Per ref (b), candidates who reach HYT on or 
after 1 July 2014, or who have received a HYT waiver prior to the board 
convening date to remain on active duty (or remain in SELRES status) beyond 1 
July 2014 are eligible for consideration by the selection board.  Candidates 
with a HYT date prior to 1 July 2014 are not eligible to compete for 
advancement unless they have an approved HYT waiver and have been validated 
by their command prior to the convening of the board.
    g.  Requests for transfer to the fleet reserve (FLTRES)/retired list.  
Voluntary FLTRES requests are those not HYT mandated; involuntary FLTRES 
requests are those submitted due to approaching HYT for the current paygrade.  
Candidates who have submitted formal written requests for voluntary transfer 
to the FLTRES are ineligible for further advancement consideration.  Members 
who have submitted involuntary FLTRES requests due to HYT are eligible for 
advancement and selection board consideration provided their HYT date for the 
present paygrade is 1 July 2014 or later.  Refer to ref (a), paragraph 209 
for guidance and mandatory administrative requirements.  
An approved or pending voluntary FLTRES/retirement request must be 
successfully disapproved, canceled, or modified to an involuntary date prior 
to the board convening to render a candidate selection board eligible.  If 
the voluntary FLTRES/retirement request is successfully disapproved, 
canceled, or modified to an involuntary date, the candidate's command must 
revalidate the candidate per paragraph 2.c.(1) of this NAVADMIN prior to 
board convening.
    h.  Security Clearance Requirements.  All personnel in certain ratings 
must maintain continuous security clearance eligibility.  A favorable 
investigation adjudication must be issued from Department of Defense Central 
Adjudication Facility or the member's commanding officer (CO) must grant 
temporary access, an interim clearance, prior to the first day of the month 
of the respective board convening date, to be board eligible.  COs must 
follow procedures in ref (c) to grant interim access.  Sailors in the 
following ratings who do not meet this requirement are ineligible for 
advancement and will not be considered board eligible:  AC, AE, AVCM, AG, AO, 
ATI, ATO, AWF, AWO, AWR, AWS, AWV, AZ, CTI, CTM, CTN, CTR, CTT, EMCM, EOD, 
ET, FC, FT, GM, HT, IC, IS, IT, ITS, LN, MA, MC, MN, MT, ND, OS, QM, SB, SO, 
STG, STS, YN, and all nuclear and submarine ratings.  This guidance 
supersedes ref (a).  
    i.  Branch class (BRCL) and special program indicator (SPI) Code.  
The Navy accounting status for BRCL 32 Sailors must be verified via the 
command's enlisted distribution verification report (EDVR).  
Naval Reserve personnel on active duty with a blank SPI Code are in an 
invalid status that may result in assignment of an incorrect advancement 
competitive category.  Commands must correct the error via the Navy standard 
integrated personnel system (NSIPS) or the Sailor may seek relief via 
petitioning the board for correction of naval records.  Sailors in this 
invalid accounting status as of the board convening date will be invalidated. 

4.  Special requirements for nuclear trained personnel (these requirements 
must be met prior to the regularly scheduled board convening date):

service.  Sailors without EDMC service documented in their service record 
must submit documentation with their LTB providing dates of EDMC service. 
    d.  To be eligible for advancement to E9, surface Sailors in nuclear 
ratings must hold a supervisor NEC (3393, 3394, 3395, 3396), and must have

8.  Communication with the selection board.  Candidates' LTB, which may be 
mailed or e-mailed to the addresses below, provides candidates the 
opportunity to submit any missing documents from the sections of their 
records that are viewed by the selection boards.  Candidates are encouraged 
to review ref (a) chapter 12 and ref (d) concerning selection board record 
review and guidance for LTB submission.  
Selection boards will review the OMPF and performance summary record (PSR) 
Parts I, II, and III of all candidates, as well as items submitted by 
candidates per policy outlined in this NAVADMIN.  A LTB is only recommended 
if the candidate's OMPF is missing information, their PSR reflects incorrect 
data, or they have information they desire to convey to the board.  
Candidates are not required to submit a LTB to notify the board that 
everything is correct in their record.  Candidates are encouraged to access 
their OMPF via BUPERS online to verify completeness.  Candidates may also 
request a copy of their OMPF as outlined in ref (e).  In many cases, items 
viewable in NSIPS electronic service record may not be contained in a 
candidate's OMPF.  If documents that candidates want the board to review are 
not viewable via "OMPF My Record", they may submit those documents with their 
LTB.  Further LTB submission guidance is as
follows:
    a.  Communication to the board must originate from the individual member 
and must be accompanied under the candidate's LTB.  
Information received that is not under the candidate's LTB (third party 
correspondence) or not received by the NPC customer service center (CSC) by 
the established deadline will not be presented to the board.  The time and 
date LTBs are received in the NPC CSC inbox (central standard time) is the 
time and date used for deadline verification.  Although a late LTB may be 
accepted by the NPC CSC, it will not be presented to the board.  This 
supersedes ref (a).
    b.  All mailed LTBs must be on plain white paper, paper clipped (no 
staples, binders, folders, or tabs), and submitted under cover letter to the 
President of the Board.  Candidates must verify the correct board number (see 
below) is on their LTB to ensure it appears before the proper board.                                            
    c.  Full name and full SSN must be affixed and legible on all documents 
submitted.                                                 
    d.  Selection board mailing addresses.  Use of special handling mail 
(certified or registered) is not advised due to significant delays in 
handling.                                                  
        (1) SELRES/Mobilized IRR E8/9 board:

    e.  E-mail address for submitting a LTB is cscselboard(at)navy.mil. E-
mailed LTBs must be encrypted to protect personally identifiable information 
(PII).  Trouble with file encryption or certificate issues does not justify a 
late LTB.  If the candidate is unable to send the e-mail encrypted to 
cscselboard(at)navy.mil, candidates may utilize the safe access file exchange 
(SAFE) website at https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/safe/
to transmit their LTB to cscselboard(at)navy.mil.  In order for LTBs to be 
considered by the board, the NPC CSC must receive the e-mail notification of 
the file upload from SAFE before the deadline.  
There may be a delay for the SAFE web site to notify NPC CSC of file upload.  
Therefore, candidates are highly encouraged to submit their LTB early.  
    f.  Candidates are authorized to submit more than one LTB, instead of 
waiting until the deadline to submit one all-inclusive LTB.  LTBs forwarded 
for consideration by the selection boards will not be added to the 
candidate's OMPF, except for award citations accurately reflected in the Navy 
department awards services (NDAWS) website, per ref (f).
