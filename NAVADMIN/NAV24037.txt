SUBJ/ESTABLISHMENT OF NAVY WOMEN'S INITIATIVES TEAM//

NARR/REF A IS TASK FORCE ONE NAVY FINAL REPORT.   
REF B IS CNO GET REAL GET BETTER 2022 REVIEW AND 2023 GUIDANCE.//

RMKS/1.  In order to prepare our Navy for combat by building stronger, more 
inclusive warfighting teams, and to recruit and retain talented people from 
across the rich fabric of America, this NAVADMIN establishes the Navy Women's 
Initiatives Team (Navy-WIT).

2.  Purpose.  The Navy-WIT will broaden awareness and influence policy 
changes to increase recruitment and retention of Servicewomen throughout the 
Navy.  It will meet on a periodic basis to build community, develop best 
practices, and discuss relevant issues leading to opportunities for barrier 
removal by Navy leadership.
WITs are in place throughout the Department of Defense and the Navy is 
deliberately linking to this structure.

3.  Intent.  Formally establishing the Navy-WIT is a direct result of 
applying Get Real, Get Better principles.  In reviewing lessons learned from 
reference (a) and implementing reference (b), it became apparent that 
informal ad hoc groups have existed without the structure necessary to 
identify and remove barriers Navy-wide.

4.  Structure.  The Office of Women's Policy (OPNAV N174B) will serve as the 
Navy-WIT Executive Advisor, reporting to the Office of Navy Culture and Force 
Resilience (OPNAV N17) and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Personnel, 
Manpower, and Training) (OPNAV N1).
OPNAV N174B will work with the designated Navy-WIT Enterprise Leads at each 
of the 27 communities and commands listed in the accompanying Navy-WIT Fact 
Sheet.  Enterprise Leads will collaborate with their local commands and 
subordinate units.  Navy-WITs are not a requirement at the Echelon-5 level, 
but are a tool for Commanders to build more inclusive and connected teams.

5.  Within 60 days of release of this message, communities and commands 
listed in the Navy-WIT Fact Sheet must designate, in writing, an officer (O4 
or senior) Navy-WIT Enterprise Lead and an enlisted (E7 or senior) Navy-WIT 
Enterprise Lead.  Civilian Navy-WIT designations are optional and may be 
designated as needed.
Designations as Enterprise Leads and participation in Navy-WIT are not 
exclusive to women.

6.  Roles and Responsibilities
    a.  OPNAV N174B Office of Women's Policy will act as the Navy- WIT 
Executive Advisor and will:
        (1) Publish priorities, outcomes achieved, and ongoing efforts in 
Navy's annual Health of the Force report.
        (2) Coordinate quarterly meetings with designated Navy-WIT Enterprise 
Leads to solicit feedback, report progress, and adjust priorities if

        (3) Meet the Charge of Command guidance by creating opportunities to

        (5) Develop and analyze data to inform policy and program revisions.
        (6) Coordinate with external organizations on Navy-WIT priorities and 
advocacy.
    b.  Designated Navy-WIT Enterprise Leads will:
        (1) Tailor Navy-WIT to best meet community/fleet/education/ 
infrastructure needs and requirements.
        (2) Ensure all Sailors within their community/command understand how 
to communicate with and participate in the tailored Navy-WIT structure.
        (3) Ensure Command Triads within their communities and fleets 
understand how to leverage the Navy-WIT to better their local 
climate/culture.
        (4) Attend quarterly Navy-WIT Enterprise meetings.
        (5) Serve as a hub for their subordinate commands by sharing relevant 
information, and generating feedback, best practices, and barriers for 
removal.

briefs.
