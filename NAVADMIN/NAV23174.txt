SUBJ/UPDATE TO PRIOR SERVICE RE-ENLISTMENT ELIGIBILITY - RESERVE
(PRISE-R) POLICY//

REF/A/DOC/COMNAVPERSCOM/13JAN2020//
REF/B/DOC/BUPERS/07FEB2022//

NARR/REF A IS MILPERSMAN 1133-061, PRIOR SERVICE RE-ENLISTMENT ELIGIBILITY - 
RESERVE (PRISE-R) PROGRAM.   
REF B IS BUPERSINST 1430.16G CH-1, ADVANCEMENT MANUAL FOR ENLISTED PERSONNEL 
OF THE U.S. NAVY AND U.S. NAVY RESERVE.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides updated policy guidance for administration of 
the Prior Service Re-enlistment Eligibility-Reserve (PRISE-R) program in line 
with reference (a), which applies to certain prior service Sailors recruited 
into the Reserve Component with a temporary rating or paygrade, with the 
option to make these permanent by completing professional development 
requirements.  Sailors requiring rating-specific training (A or C
schools) are not affected and are still required to complete program 
requirements in line with reference (a) to make their rating permanent.

2.  The requirement for all Selected Reserve (SELRES) E-4 candidates to take 
the Navy-wide advancement exam (NWAE) to compete for advancement to E-4 is 
eliminated.  Effective immediately, all PRISE-R Sailors who have not 
completed program requirements through the NWAE, and have no rating-specific 
training requirements, will have their temporary rating made permanent.  
Commander, Navy Reserve Forces Command (COMNAVRESFORCOM) will remove the 
"Targeted Reentry Program" manpower availability status code in Navy Standard 
Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) and submit a single consolidated Navy 
enlisted classification (NEC) Change Request (NAVPERS 1221/6) to Enlisted 
Placement Management (PERS-4013) requesting removal of conversion NEC for all 
affected Sailors.

3.  PRISE-R Sailors who wish to revert to their prior rating may do so by 
contacting their command career counselor for the most current 
COMNAVRESFORCOM guidance and eligibility requirements.  This authorization 
applies only to Navy Veterans (NAVET).  Other service veterans (OSVET) are 
not eligible to apply for rate reversion.
Sailors seeking rating conversion can apply via career waypoints through the 
Reserve Component (RC) to RC module.

4.  New Prior Service Affiliations/Accessions.  The PRISE-R program is open 
to qualifying NAVETs and OSVETs as a path to Navy Reserve affiliation via a 
change in rate or occupational specialty upon transition to the SELRES.  All 
personnel will meet specific rating requirements and program requirements in 
line with reference (a) with the below program updates, though waivers may be 
authorized on a case-by-case basis.
    a.  Applicants who affiliate in a non-service school required rating will 
have their rate made permanent upon reporting to the Navy Reserve Center 
(NRC) or Navy Reserve Activity (NRA).
    b.  Applicants may not have prior non-judicial punishment or convictions 
in civilian or military courts within the previous 36 months.
    c.  Applicants in the pay grade of E-4 must have a time in service (TIS), 
as calculated from their adjusted pay entry base date
(PEBD) upon enlistment, of fewer than 12 years.

5.  Advancement Eligibility.  Starting with NWAE cycle 113, PRISE-R Sailors 
affected by this NAVADMIN with their now permanent rating may participate for 
advancement as long as all eligibility requirements are met in line with 
reference (b) and the applicable NWAE cycle NAVADMIN, utilizing the paygrade-
specific advancement methodology promulgated via the NWAE cycle NAVADMIN.  
All prior service Sailors with a break in service must have a time-in-rate
(TIR) recalculation completed in line with reference (b) prior to their 
advancement exam.  The new TIR must be updated in NSIPS by the Sailor's NRC 
or NRA.

6.  Enlisted Incentives.  PRISE-R Sailors may be eligible for a SELRES 
enlisted incentive upon completion of PRISE-R program requirements.  PRISE-R 
Sailors affected by this NAVADMIN have met their PRISE-R program requirements 
and should contact their NRC/NRA command career counselor or bonus incentive 
coordinator for guidance on requesting a SELRES enlisted incentive.  
Eligibility criteria for SELRES enlisted incentives may be found on the Navy 
Reserve homeport website at: https://private.navyreserve.navy.mil/cnrfc/N-
Codes/N1/CNRFC_N112/SitePages/Home.aspx.
