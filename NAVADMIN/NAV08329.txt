SUBJ/ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT-BASED PROMOTION POLICY FOR 
RESERVE COMPONENT (RC) OFFICERS// 
REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/08DEC2005// REF/B/DOC/USCODE/03JAN07// NARR/REF A IS 
OPNAVINST 1427.1, REGULATIONS GOVERNING RUNNING MATES, PRECEDENCE, AND 
COMPETITIVE CATEGORIES FOR OFFICERS OF THE NAVY RESERVE.  REF B IS 
TITLE 10, UNITED STATES CODE, SECTION 14306.// RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN 
ANNOUNCES SECNAV APPROVAL FOR THE NAVY RESERVE TO TRANSITION TO A 
COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT-BASED PROMOTION POLICY BY DECOUPLING RESERVE 
OFFICER PROMOTIONS FROM ACTIVE COMPONENT (AC) OFFICER PROMOTIONS, AS 
WAS DONE UNDER THE RUNNING MATE SYSTEM (RMS) PER REFS A AND B.  THE RMS 
HAD BEEN IN USE SINCE 1947, AND LINKED RESERVE COMPONENT (RC) AND AC 
PROMOTION ZONES WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF RC COMMUNITY NEEDS.  WITH THE 
RMS, AN OFFICER ON THE RESERVE ACTIVE STATUS LIST WAS IN ZONE AND 
ELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION FOR PROMOTION WHEN THE OFFICER'S ACTIVE-DUTY 
LIST RUNNING MATE WAS IN ZONE AND ELIGIBLE.  
RC OFFICERS SELECTED UNDER THE RMS WERE PROMOTED WHEN THEIR ACTIVE DUTY 
RUNNING MATES WERE PROMOTED.  UNDER THE NEW TOTAL FORCE CONSTRUCT, 
COMMUNITY MANAGERS NOW HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEVELOP RC PROMOTION 
PLANS AND POLICIES WHICH MEET INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY AND COMPONENT NEEDS.  
THIS FLEXIBILITY WILL BETTER EQUIP COMMUNITY MANAGERS TO MEET NAVY 
REQUIREMENTS BY BUILDING PROMOTION ZONES SIZED TO ENSURE THE RIGHT 
NUMBER OF OFFICERS ARE PROMOTED WHILE MAINTAINING STABLE PROMOTION 
OPPORTUNITY.  THE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITY WILL BE DETERMINED USING THE 
GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY TITLE 10, UNITED STATES CODE, AND DOD AND 
SECNAV POLICY. 
2.  THIS POLICY DECISION IS A POSITIVE STEP THAT WILL IMPROVE OUR 
ABILITY TO MANAGE THE TOTAL FORCE.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT NAVY TOTAL 
FORCE WILL NOW BE ABLE TO MANAGE OUR HIGH QUALITY RC FORCE BASED ON 
REQUIREMENTS FOR RC OFFICERS INTO THE FUTURE.
