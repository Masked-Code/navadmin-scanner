0416, 0417, 0501, 0507, 0551 or 0553.

5.  Current CWOs that meet the requirements in paragraph 4, or hold 
Additional Qualification Designators BA4, BA5 or BA9, may apply for 
redesignation without board action to 7281 in line with reference (c).  
Personnel meeting requirements and that are endorsed by the IUSS Type 
Commander and Limited Duty Officer/CWO community manager will be redesignated 
by Military Community Management (BUPERS-3). Sample re-designation request 
may be obtained by contacting the LDO/CWO Officer Community Manager as 
provided in paragraph 7.

6.  Current 728X submarine electronics technicians will continue to be 
detailed by Submarine/Nuclear LDO/CWO Manager to electronics billets based on 
their technical skills.

7.  Point of contact is Mr. Mitch Allen who can be reached at (901) 874-
3044/DSN 882, or via e-mail at mitchell.allen(at)navy.mil.

8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or 30 September
