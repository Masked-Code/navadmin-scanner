SUBJ/RECLASSIFICATION OF ENLISTED TYPE 3 DUTY TO TYPE 1 OR TYPE 6
/DUTY FOR DESIGNATED COMMANDS//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THE ENLISTED TYPE DUTY CODE FOR SOME DESIGNATED
TYPE 3 OVERSEAS/REMOTE LAND-BASED SEA DUTY ASSIGNMENTS IS BEING
RE-DESIGNATED TO TYPE 1, U.S. SHORE DUTY, OR TYPE 6, OVERSEAS SHORE
DUTY.  THESE CHANGES WILL ASSIST IN PROPERLY ALIGNING NAVY MANNING
PRIORITIES, INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SAILORS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO
FILL CRITICAL BILLETS AT SEA, AND ENSURE THE RIGHT SAILORS WITH THE
RIGHT SKILLS ARE AVAILABLE TO FILL CRITICAL BILLETS ON TIME.
2.  EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, COMMANDS LISTED IN PARAGRAPH 7 WILL BE
CONVERTED FROM TYPE 3 TO TYPE 1 DUTY, AND COMMANDS LISTED IN PARA 8
WILL BE CONVERTED FROM TYPE 3 TO TYPE 6 DUTY.  PERSONNEL CURRENTLY
SERVING IN, UNDER ORDERS TO, OR WHO HAVE NEGOTIATED ORDERS TO ANY OF
THE TYPE 3 COMMANDS LISTED WILL HAVE THEIR ENTIRE TOUR COUNTED AS
TYPE 3 SEA DUTY (GRANDFATHERED).
3.  TYPE 1 DUTY IS PERFORMED AT LAND-BASED ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED
STATES (INCLUDING HAWAII AND ANCHORAGE, ALASKA) WHERE MEMBERS ARE
NOT REQUIRED TO BE ABSENT FROM THE CORPORATE LIMITS OF THEIR DUTY
STATION IN EXCESS OF 150 DAYS PER YEAR.  TYPE 3 DUTY IS PERFORMED IN
OVERSEAS/REMOTE LAND-BASED ACTIVITIES WHERE MEMBERS ARE NOT
REQUIRED TO BE ABSENT FROM THE CORPORATE LIMITS OF THEIR DUTY
STATION IN EXCESS OF 150 DAYS PER YEAR, BUT IS CREDITED AS SEA DUTY
FOR ROTATIONAL PURPOSES.  TYPE 6 DUTY IS PERFORMED AT OVERSEAS
LAND-BASED ACTIVITIES WHERE MEMBERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE ABSENT
FROM THE CORPORATE LIMITS OF THEIR DUTY STATION IN EXCESS OF 150
DAYS PER YEAR, AND IS CREDITED AS SHORE DUTY FOR ROTATIONAL
PURPOSES.
4.  HISTORICALLY, TYPE 3 DUTY HAS BEEN SERVED IN REMOTE/ISOLATED
AREAS WITH LITTLE INFRASTRUCTURE OR HAS BEEN USED TO ATTRACT
VOLUNTEERS TO VARIOUS OVERSEAS AREAS.  SEA DUTY CREDIT AS AN
INCENTIVE FOR OVERSEAS SHORE DUTY JOBS HAS OFTEN MISALIGNED SAILORS
OUTSIDE OF NORMAL SEA/SHORE ROTATION, RESULTING IN FEWER PERSONNEL
AVAILABLE FOR DECK-PLATE ASSIGNMENTS TO DEPLOYING UNITS.  IN SOME
CASES, IT HAS ALSO RESULTED IN ASSIGNMENTS THAT ARE NOT IN THE
SAILOR S BEST INTEREST FROM A CAREER PROGRESSION PERSPECTIVE AS THEY
COMPETE WITH SAILORS SERVING AT SEA.  DESIGNED TO ENHANCE COMBAT
READINESS, THESE TYPE DUTY CHANGES WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF
SAILORS AVAILABLE TO FILL CRITICAL BILLETS AT SEA AND ALIGN OUR
MANNING PRIORITIES.  IT WILL ALSO HELP RESTORE THE PROPER BALANCE TO
NAVY S FUNDAMENTAL SEA/SHORE ROTATION.
5.  NAVADMIN 290/04 UPDATED THE ASSIGNMENT INCENTIVE PAY PROGRAM.
BILLETS IN COMMANDS DESIGNATED FOR RECLASSIFICATION IN THIS NAVADMIN
ARE NOW ELIGIBLE FOR ASSIGNMENT INCENTIVE PAY.  THIS PAY WAS
DESIGNED TO REPLACE SEA DUTY CREDIT FOR SELECT SHORE DUTY
ASSIGNMENTS AND ATTRACT VOLUNTEERS.  THE CURRENT LIST OF ASSIGNMENT
INCENTIVE PAY ELIGIBLE COMMANDS, RATINGS, AND MAXIMUM BID RATES ARE
AVAILABLE AT WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/CAREERINFO/PAYANDBENEFITS/AIP.
6.  MEMBERS CURRENTLY ON BOARD COMMANDS LISTED IN PARAGRAPHS 7 AND 8
WILL HAVE THEIR PERFORMANCE SUMMARY RECORDS AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTED
TO REFLECT TYPE 3 SEA DUTY CREDIT (GRANDFATHERED).  ADJUSTMENTS TO
PERFORMANCE SUMMARY RECORDS FOR SAILORS NOT PRESENTLY ON BOARD THESE
COMMANDS AND GRANDFATHERED FOR TYPE 3 SEA DUTY (SEE PARAGRAPH 2)
MUST BE SUBMITTED TO A COMMAND DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE, WHO WILL
FORWARD A CONSOLIDATED PERFORMANCE SUMMARY RECORD CORRECTION REQUEST
VIA EMAIL TO COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-451) AT PERS451@NAVY.MIL.
