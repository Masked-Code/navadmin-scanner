2.  Background:
a.  The Olmsted Scholar Program offers outstanding young military leaders an 
unsurpassed opportunity to achieve fluency in a foreign language, pursue 
graduate study at an overseas university and acquire an in-depth 
understanding of foreign cultures, thereby equipping them to serve in 
positions of greater responsibility as senior leaders in the United States 
Armed Forces.  This unique scholarship opportunity supports the Secretary of 
Defense's emphasis on developing language skills and regional cultural 
knowledge across the force.  The Olmsted Scholar program also meets 
educational requirements for both Flag Officer and Major Command.
b.  The Olmsted Scholar Program is a three-year program for which career 
timing is an important consideration.  Applicants must contact their detailer 
for counseling on the career feasibility of participation in the Olmsted 
Scholar Program.  To be considered by the Navy selection board, a detailer 
written/signed statement, as stated in enclosure (3) of reference (a), must 
be included in the nomination package.

3.  Criteria:
a.  All active duty, regular officers with the designators 1110, 1120, 1130, 
1140, 1310, 1320, 1810, 1820, 1830, and 3100 with at least three years of 
Active Federal Commissioned Service (AFCS) and no more than 13.5 years of 
total Active Federal Service (AFS) as of 1 April 2021 are eligible to apply.  
The maximum length of service eligibility requirement has been extended for 
all eligible designators from 11 years to 13.5 years as part of a three-year 
trial program.

4.  Application Process:
a.  Applicants should be available to commence language training in 
summer/fall 2021 at Defense Language Institute East or West, begin two years 
of study at a foreign university in 2022 and complete their studies in 2024.  
A Navy selection board will convene in November 2020 to select up to 12 
nominees from which the Olmsted Foundation Board of Directors will consider 
and select Navy scholars to receive this prestigious scholarship in March 
2021.  Navy is seeking applicants who display the warfighting and 
intellectual qualities of dedicated career officers who aspire to command.

5.  Selection Notifications:
a.  Olmsted notifications will occur in two phases.  Navy nominees will be 
notified via email following the Navy selection board in November 2020.
