SUBJ/2013 VICE ADMIRAL JAMES BOND STOCKDALE LEADERSHIP AWARD WINNERS// 

RMKS/1.  I am pleased to announce that CDR Richard N. Massie, from  the 
Pacific Fleet, and CDR Leif E. Mollo, from Fleet Forces Command, are the 2013 
recipients of the Vice Admiral (VADM) James Bond  Stockdale Award for 
inspirational leadership.  CDR Richard N. Massie was selected for his 
performance as Commanding Officer, USS MAINE (SSBN 741) (GOLD) and CDR Leif 
E. Mollo for his performance as Commanding Officer, SEAL Team FOUR.

2.  This fleet award was established in honor of VADM James Bond Stockdale, 
whose distinguished Naval career symbolized the highest standards of 
excellence in both personal example and leadership.  The award is presented 
annually to two commissioned officers on active duty in the grade of 
commander or below who are serving in command of a single ship, submarine, 
aviation squadron, Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) team, naval special warfare 
squadron, SEAL delivery vehicle team, special boat team, explosive ordnance 
disposal mobile unit, mobile diving and salvage unit, or Navy special 
clearance team during the nomination cycle.  Candidates are nominated by 
peers who themselves must be eligible for the award.

3.  The 2013 winners were chosen from among nine outstanding finalists in a 
review process that included screening at the fleet commander level and final 
selection by a board of senior officers.
