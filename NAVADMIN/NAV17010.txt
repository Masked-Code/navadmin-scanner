RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides notice of and information about resources 
available at the Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC) to support Navy 
commands' and fleet units' use of our rich history and heritage to enhance 
their mission.  All COs, XOs, OICs, and CMCs are encouraged to make use of 
the resources listed in this NAVADMIN to promote naval history and heritage 
as desired in execution of their duties.

2.  Naval history and heritage are important components to every command's 
warfighting effectiveness.  As stated in the introduction to the Design for 
Maritime Superiority, "As we get underway, we must first understand our 
history - how we got to where we are."  Naval history and heritage inspires 
and empowers the Navy's most important asset, its Sailors.  Our 240 years of 
proud history and traditions serve as foundation for Navy's core values of 
honor, courage, and commitment. Our history and heritage provide examples of 
integrity, accountability, initiative, and toughness to continue to imbue our 
Sailors with a warfighting ethos, teamwork, and esprit de corps, all critical 
to warfighting effectiveness and readiness for decisive operations and 
combat.

3.  In addition to their warfighting functions, Navy commands also typically 
conduct the following efforts, which NHHC can support with their experts and 
resources, outlined in para 4:
    a.  Promoting Navy culture and reinforcing core values.  This function 
can range from educating on the legacy of those who have gone before, to 
building a command climate with core attributes of integrity, accountability, 
initiative, and toughness during unit pre-commissioning or everyday 
operations.
    b.  Executing command events and engagements.  This function can range 
from re-enlistments, promotions, change of commands, and retirements, to 
training and command stand-downs, to major international distinguished 
visitor engagements.
    c.  Information gathering and research.  This function ranges from 
administrative, such as compiling historical information for the Plan of the 
Day/Week, to tactical, such as researching riverine tactics employed during 
the Vietnam War to support current tactics development.
    d.  Conducting outreach.  Navy commands also conduct events and share 
information so the American public can connect with its Sailors.

4.  To assist Navy commands, ref (a) tasks Director, Naval History and 
Heritage Command to ensure Navy operational, training, and educational 
commands have direct and continuing access to historical resources and 
advice.  NHHC resources are available, both online 
(https://www.history.navy.mil) or directly at NHHC facilities.
The following are examples of available resources:
