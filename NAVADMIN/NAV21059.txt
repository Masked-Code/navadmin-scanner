RMKS/1.  Reference (a) is canceled and replaced by reference (b).  
Delegations and subsequent exceptions granted in references (d) and (e) 
remain in effect.

2.  Additional guidance on implementation of reference (b):

2.a.  The Department of the Navy is committed to ensuring the health and 
safety of our military members, civilian employees, contractors and their 
families in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Actions taken in accordance 
with reference (b) shall be consistent with the best available medical and 
scientific data available and current Center for Disease Control (CDC) 
guidance.

2.b.  Reference (c) implements Executive Order 13991 and requires strict 
compliance with CDC guidance regarding wearing masks, maintaining physical 
distance, and other public health measures by all on-duty or on-site federal 
employees or contractors and all persons in federal buildings or on federal 
lands in order to halt the spread of COVID-19.  Note the limitations of the 
delegation granted in reference (c), which allows authority to grant 
exceptions only in environments other than office spaces. The intent of both 
references (b) and (c) is increased enforcement of public health measures to 
defeat the spread of COVID-19.  As a result, the authority to grant 
categorical exceptions delegated in references (b) and (c) should be 
exercised cautiously.
Exceptions granted must be carefully scrutinized to ensure that the request 
applies only outside of office settings, is necessary for military readiness, 
and is carefully evaluated against the intent of reference (c), the best 
available medical and scientific data on risk to mission and current CDC 
guidance available at:  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html.

2.c.  In addition to the requirements in reference (b) regarding exceptions, 
flag officers exercising delegated authority for exceptions to mask wearing 
and other public health measures should coordinate with their Echelon II 
Commander to ensure consistent implementation of the policy across Navy 
regions.
Co-located Echelon II Commanders will work together to ensure consistent 
implementation in the best interest of the service and its obligations 
pursuant to references (b) and (c).
