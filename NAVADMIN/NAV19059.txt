SUBJ/MYNAVY PORTAL ADVANCEMENT DASHBOARD LAUNCH//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the release of the E4-E6 Enlisted 
Advancement Dashboard in MyNavy Portal (MNP).  The E4-E6 Advancement 
Dashboard is a web-based dashboard on MNP located on the Advancement and 
Promotion Career and Life Event (CLE) page.  It provides E4-E6 candidates a 
detailed view of their eligibility status for advancement with instructions 
and documentation to prepare for the advancement process.  Enlisted Sailors 
now have a more transparent view into the advancement process and increased 
ability to self- service resources to study for the Navy-wide Advancement 
Exam.  The E4-E6 Advancement Dashboard provides access to the following self- 
service capabilities:
    a.  A view into eligibility status based on MyRecord and their Enlisted 
Advancement Worksheet (EAW)
    b.  Ability to calculate their final multiple score
    c.  Ability to auto-populate Advancement Exam checklists and a timeline 
of action items for advancement
    d.  Guidance for obtaining study materials, frequently asked questions 
and knowledge management articles related to advancement information
    e.  Ability to review and understand advancement eligibility
    f.  Ability to submit inquiries through the service request feature on 
MNP

2.  An expansion to the Advancement Dashboard to cover E7-E9 candidates will 
follow.  More features will be rolling out as the EAW becomes available in 
fall of 2019 and the Professional Military Knowledge Exam is automated.

3.  Additional recent upgrades in MNP include:
    a.  MyRecord Web Through the MyRecord tab, Sailors can now access their 
Official Military Personnel File and their security clearance data.  
Additionally, enlisted Sailors can view Career Waypoints through MNP.  These 
features allow Sailors to better manage their careers.
    b.  Proxy Scheduling Staff, supervisors and administrators now have the 
ability to schedule requests for language testing or educational counseling 
on behalf of Sailors by using the Voluntary Education Proxy Scheduling.  The 
feature provides greater efficiency in managing and assisting Sailors to 
fulfill their educational requirements.

4.  We want to hear from you!  Please use the Feedback button on MNP or
