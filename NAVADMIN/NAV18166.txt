RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN is the third in a series of NAVADMINs providing 
updates on the Navy/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) Secret Internet Protocol 
Routing Network (SIPRNet) and Non-Classified Internet Protocol Routing 
Network (NIPRNet) enterprise migration to Windows 10 Secure Host Baseline 
(WIN10 SHB).  It outlines current status of the migration and efforts being 
taken to resolve remaining challenges.  Continued maximum effort is necessary 
by leadership at all commands to get the Navy to 100 percent migration to the 
WIN10 SHB for all NMCI seats by 31 July 2018 in order to improve Cyber 
security, promote standardization across the Naval Enterprise Network, and 
comply with the Department of Defense mandate.

2.  The NMCI WIN10 SHB enterprise migration status for NIPRNet is at 95.8 
percent and for SIPRNet is at 79.7 percent complete.  Several migration 
challenges are being addressed:
    a.  Help Desk Support and resolution times.  Discussed in paragraph 3.
    b.  Bandwidth and software distribution across the network.  Due to the 
large amount of bandwidth required to push updates over the network, some 
machines are unable to effectively pull the software.  This is especially 
evident on SIPRNet and manual procedures for fixing this are being 
implemented this week.
    c.  NIPRNet machines being physically disconnected from the network at 
the time of a scheduled In-Place Upgrade (IPU).  Seats that are not 
physically connected to the NMCI enterprise at the time of upgrade are being 
reported daily to Command Chief Information
Officer(s) (CIO) and Contract Technical Representatives (CTR) so that local 
personnel can take immediate action to connect the machines.  Commands are 
directed to ensure all workstations and laptops remain connected to receive 
the required IPU.  Quarantine process explained in paragraph 7.

3.  Due to numerous issues with WIN10 migrations and other software 
deployment the Service Desk is experiencing a much higher than normal call 
volume which has also resulted in a Service Desk backlog (this includes 
email, enterprise self-service, and voicemail).  Program Executive Office for 
Enterprise Information Systems and the contractors are working aggressively 
to resolve all trouble calls and additional manpower has been brought on line 
over the last 60 days to reduce the volume.  Trouble tickets are prioritized 
with non-operable workstations and machines being fixed first followed by all 
other trouble calls in the order in which they are reported.  Current volume 
of trouble calls has been reduced by
50 percent over the last three weeks.

4.  Command CIOs and CTRs are aggressively tracking the scheduled upgrades 
for their commands to ensure that planned seat migrations remain on schedule.  
Detailed scheduling and reporting capabilities are available to the CTRs.  
CIOs and CTRs must ensure that users are informed of the importance of 
maintaining the scheduled migration dates for each seat and provide each user 
with information about their WIN10 migration method and their scheduled 
upgrade date.  CIOs and CTRs are to remind users of reference D, direction 
regarding end of day actions.
    a.  Any new seat orders received after 13 July 2018 will not be delivered 
before 31 July 2018.  The existing seat that it is replacing will be 
quarantined if not migrated to WIN10 by 31 July 2018.

5.  Individual User Responsibilities:
    a.  End of Day Actions:  Users still on Windows 7 - select "Restart" vice 
Shutdown, and select No when prompted for Green Shutdown.  This allows the 
computer to receive software patches and perform standard maintenance in 
preparation for WIN10 migration.
    b.  Know when your computer is scheduled for Technical Refresh (TR), Wipe 
and Reimage (W&R) or to receive the IPU.  Ensure your NIPRNet computer 
remains plugged in via cable to the network and powered on for five days 
prior to your upgrade date.  Ensure your power saver feature is disabled so 
the computer remains powered on.
    c.  Plan to be without your computer for 24 hours on your scheduled date.  
This will not affect your ability to log in to other computers and continue 
to access your data on the NMCI shared drives to continue work.
    d.  Back up any data on your computer to a share drive or external hard 
drive (if you have one) so that you can retrieve your data after migration.  
Contact your Information Systems Technician
(IT) Support staff for alternate backup methods if your data backup 
requirements exceed your share drive capacity.
    e.  Ensure that your individual machine is physically connected to the 
NMCI network.

6.  SIPRNET Migration to WIN10 SHB is underway via TR, IPU, and W&R.  The 
SIPR IPU process commenced 1 June 2018 with the preload of IPU software 
packages.  However, due to bandwidth and software server distribution issues 
as noted in paragraph 1, this has proven challenging for successful execution 
for all seats.  Manual procedures for performing software distribution are 
being implemented this week to ensure commands can meet the 31 July 2018 
deadline for migration and are being distributed to command representatives.

7.  Any computer that has not completed migration on 31 July 2018 will be 
quarantined until it is upgraded to WIN10.  Users of the quarantined seat 
will not be able to log on to that computer but can continue to logon and 
work from a WIN10 machine.  Quarantined users will contact the command CTR or 
IT Support staff to have that computer migrated to WIN10 to resume normal 
operations.

Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
