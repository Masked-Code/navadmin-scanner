SUBJ/FY-17 ACTIVE COMPONENT AVIATION COMMAND RETENTION BONUS//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the continuation of the Aviation Command 
Retention Bonus (ACRB).  The ACRB is designed to retain for continued naval 
service those officers with the talent and command experience in a primary 
warfighting mission that is critical for the future of our institution.

2.  ACRB applicants must be currently serving as a commanding officer (CO) of 
an eligible operational (OP), operational training (OP-T), or special mission 
(SM) O-5 command in order to apply.
Eligible commands are those OP, OP-T, and SM O-5 commands for which the 
annual Aviation Command Screen Board selects officers to serve as COs, 
excluding second-in-grade/sequential/bonus/fleet replacement squadron 
commands.  Eligibility to apply for the ACRB ends on the last day of command.

3.  Post command commanders not on contract who served as CO of an eligible 
OP, OP-T, or SM O-5 command between 1 October 2016 and the release date of 
this NAVADMIN are eligible to apply within 30 days from release of this 
NAVADMIN whereby signed contracts must be received by an Assistant Aviation 
OCM (PERS-435).

4.  All ACRB contracts will be for 36,000 dollars.  All eligible officers 
will receive 18,000 dollars per year for 2 years of obligated service, which 
is the 21ST and 22ND years of commissioned service.  If an ACRB contract of 
an officer is approved after completing 20 years of commissioned service, 
then the ACRB obligation period begins on the date of contract approval and 
ends 2 years later.
