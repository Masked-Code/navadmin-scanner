SUBJ/COAST GUARD BIRTHDAY MESSAGE// 

RMKS/1.  Congratulations to the men and women of the Coast Guard and your families as you celebrate 
the 223rd birthday of the United States Coast Guard on 4 August 2013.

2.  The United States Navy serves with pride alongside our sea service partner.  From the establishment 
of the Revenue Cutter Service by Alexander Hamilton on 4 August 1790, the Coast Guard has been 
steadfastly committed to the maritime safety, security, and stewardship of our Nation's waterways.  
Whether enforcing laws, fighting wars, or rescuing those in distress, the Coast Guard has been a faithful 
guardian of our citizens, resources, and prosperity.

3.  As we face the global challenges of the future, the Coast Guard will remain invaluable to our Nation's 
defense.  Together, the Coast Guard and Navy-Marine Corps team will continue to evolve to meet 
tomorrow's uncertain sea conditions and sea-borne threats.  Thriving within our strategic partnership, 
the Coast Guard's irreplaceable contributions in the maritime domain will prove essential as we take on 
these challenges.

4.  The men and women of the Navy salute all Coastguardsmen as you celebrate your 223rd year of 
dedicated and selfless service to the
Nation:  Saving lives, defending the homeland, and enforcing federal laws on the waterways.  The 
protection of our homeland's shores rests squarely on your shoulders.  Thank you for your service and 
Happy Birthday, Shipmates.

5.  Released by the Chief of Naval Operations.//
