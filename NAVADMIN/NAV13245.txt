RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides Navy-specific direction to execute the 
requirement for secure internet protocol router network public key enablement 
(PKE) as originally detailed in Refs A and B and subsequently revised in Refs 
C and D.  It also supersedes and amplifies the waiver guidance provided in 
Ref D.  Refs A through D apply to all Navy owned, operated, or controlled 
SIPRNET connected networks, web servers, and applications.  System owners 
shall implement PKE per Refs A through D. 

2.  Background.  USCYBERCOM has directed DoD components to issue National 
Security Service (NSS) PKI hardware tokens to all DoD users and implement 
cryptographic network logon for the SIPRNET, while maintaining the ability 
for temporary exception users (e.g., those who experience loss or failure of 
token in operational environments creating a stop work situation) to access 
SIPRNET resources using username and password.  Ref D provides applicable 
Navy systems deadlines to implement PKE per Refs A through C.

3.  Action.  System owners who did not meet the following deadlines outlined 
in Ref D, are directed to submit a detailed mitigation plan, implementation 
plan of action and milestones and justification to Deputy Director Chief 
Information Officer, Navy (DDCIO(N)) no later than 9 October 2013 for review:  
    a.  NMCI and ONE-NET early adopters:  31 July 2013
    b.  NMCI NADSUSWE Domain:  7 August 2013
    c.  NMCI NADSUSEA Domain:  13 August 2013
    d.  ONE-NET and Non-Enterprise networks:  1 August 2013
    e.  IT21 Afloat:  31 December 2015
This does not apply to system owners who already submitted mitigation  plans 
per Ref D section 6.  

4.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or  superseded.
5.  Point of contact is Mr. Joseph Waler, N2N6BC4, at (571) 256-8523 or via 
email joe.t.walker(at)navy.mil. 

6.  Released by VADM Ted N. Branch, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, 
Information Dominance, OPNAV N2N6.//
