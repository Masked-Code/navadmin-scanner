RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN SOLICITS APPLICATIONS FOR THE ALASKA SEA
SERVICES SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM, WHICH ANNUALLY AWARDS FOUR $1,000
SCHOLARSHIPS FOR UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION TO DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND
SPOUSES OF NAVY, MARINE CORPS, AND COAST GUARD PERSONNEL WHO LEGALLY
CLAIM ALASKA AS THEIR STATE OF RESIDENCE. APPLICATION DEADLINE IS 01
MARCH 2006 FOR THE FY06 SELECTION BOARD WHICH CONVENES IN 
APRIL 2006.
2.  BACKGROUND:  THE CITIZENS OF ALASKA RAISED FUNDS FOR A $10,000
WAR BOND AS A GIFT TO USS JUNEAU (CL-52) DURING WORLD WAR II. AFTER
THE SINKING OF THE USS JUNEAU, THIS GIFT WAS TO HAVE BEEN
PRESENTED TO THE USS ALASKA (CB-1).  HOWEVER, THE USS ALASKA WAS
DECOMMISSIONED BEFORE THE PURCHASE AND PRESENTATION.  CONSEQUENTLY,
THE GOVERNOR OF THE TERRITORY OF ALASKA AND THE SECRETARY OF THE
NAVY AGREED THAT THE BOND WOULD BE LEFT ON DEPOSIT IN THE FIRST
NATIONAL BANK OF JUNEAU UNTIL THE USS ALASKA WAS RECOMMISSIONED OR
ANOTHER APPROPRIATE APPLICATION OF THESE MONIES COULD BE MADE.  IN
1986, THE NAVY ESTABLISHED THE ALASKA SEA SERVICE SCHOLARSHIP FUND.
3.  TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THE ALASKA SEA SERVICES SCHOLARSHIP, AN

CORPS, OR COAST GUARD MEMBER ON ACTIVE DUTY, ON INACTIVE DUTY, OR
RETIRED WITH OR WITHOUT PAY.  THE CANDIDATES SELECTED WILL BE THOSE
WHO RATE HIGHEST IN FIVE KEY AREAS:  ACADEMIC PROFICIENCY,
CHARACTER, LEADERSHIP ABILITY, COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT, AND FINANCIAL
NEED.  A SELECTION BOARD WILL BE HELD BY THE NAVY LEAGUE FOUNDATION.
THE SELECTED NOMINEE PACKAGES WILL THEN BE SUBMITTED TO THE NAVAL
EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND FOR FINAL APPROVAL, AFTER WHICH 
SELECTEES WILL BE NOTIFIED AND SCHOLARSHIP FUNDS WILL BE
DISBURSED TO THE APPROPRIATE ACADEMIC INSTITUTION.
4.  APPLICANT PROCEDURES:  FOUR $1,000 SCHOLARSHIPS ARE AWARDED
ANNUALLY TO APPLICANTS WHO MEET THE SPECIFIED CRITERIA.  APPLICANTS
MUST ALSO SHOW ACCEPTANCE AT AN ACCREDITED COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY FOR
