SUBJ/OPENING SUBMARINE FORCE BILLETS TO ENLISTED WOMEN// 


MSGID/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/N1/JAN//

RMKS/1.  In July 2014, the Secretary of the Navy approved an integration plan 
to open to all women previously closed ratings and Navy Enlisted 
Classification (NEC) codes in the submarine force.  This plan includes the 
opportunity for all enlisted female Sailors of ranks E-1 to E-8 and all 
ratings to request a conversion to serve in the submarine force.

2.  The integration of female enlisted Sailors will follow the successful 
integration of female officers aboard submarines in a similar manner.
Initially, Sailors will be selected and trained for rating conversion to 
serve aboard SSGNs and SSBNs previously integrated with female officers.
The first two crews will be integrated in 2016, with an additional two to 
four crews added each year through 2021.  Phase two of the plan will 
integrate enlisted female Sailors aboard new construction VIRGINIA -class 
SSNs in approximately 2020.

3.  Eligibility.
    a.  E-7/8.  Chief Petty Officers (CPOs) with the following
    ratings
will be eligible to request assignment aboard submarines:
IT/YN/CS/LS/HM(IDC).  These CPOs will be the first enlisted women assigned to 
integrated crews and will arrive in sufficient time to fully integrate into 
the crew prior to junior personnel arriving.
CPOs with these ratings will be chosen to bring their current expertise and 
leadership skills aboard submarines quickly, which will be essential in the 
follow-on integration of junior female Sailors.  CPOs will be selected from 
these ratings for conversion and assignment in submarines until their 
important leadership role can be filled by the normal advancement process 
inside the submarine force.  Following selection, CPOs will attend basic 
enlisted submarine school and any necessary rate-specific training prior to 
being assigned to their first submarine.
Details on the application and selection process will be provided in a 
separate NAVADMIN (FY16 ENLISTED WOMEN IN SUBMARINES CHIEF PETTY OFFICER 
CONVERSION PROCESS).
    b.  E-6 and below Sailors with an assigned rating.  All E-6 and below 
female Sailors are eligible to apply for rating conversion into one of the 
following submarine ratings:  STS/FT/MMW/MT/ITS/ET-NAV/ET -COM/LS/YN/CS/MMA.
Each Sailor selected for conversion will attend basic enlisted submarine 
school followed by *A* and *C* schools, as needed, based on their selected 
rating and expertise.  Details on the application and selection process will 
be provided in a separate NAVADMIN (FY16 ENLISTED WOMEN IN SUBMARINES E-6 AND 
BELOW RATING CONVERSION PROCESS).
    c.  New recruits and Sailors without an assigned rating.  Female recruits 
and female Sailors who have not yet selected a rating are eligible to apply 
for training and assignment in the following
ratings:
STS/FT/MMW/MT/ITS/ET-NAV/ET-COM/LS/YN/CS/MMA/EMN/MMN/ETN/MMN-ELT.
Following assignment, these Sailors will complete the same training pipeline 
as their male counterparts.  Sailors serving in the fleet who have not yet 
selected a rating may apply per NAVADMIN (FY16 ENLISTED WOMEN IN SUBMARINES 
E-6 AND BELOW RATING CONVERSION PROCESS).  Specific guidance for Navy 
Recruiters will be provided SEPCOR from Navy Recruiting Command.
       d.  Nuclear Trained Sailors.  Female Sailors in the nuclear
       training
pipeline or serving as junior staff instructors at a Nuclear Power Training 
Unit (NPTU) should contact their Command Career Counselors for details on how 
to apply for submarine service.  Specific guidance for Navy Recruiters will 
be provided SEPCOR from Navy Recruiting Command.

4.  To support the integration of submarine crews, ships that will have 
enlisted women onboard will be modified to ensure conditions meet Navy 
guidelines for habitability and privacy while maintaining equity for male and 
female Sailors embarked in submarines.

5.  More information on the opportunities available and the benefits of 
service in the submarine force is available via the NPC website at 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/enlisted/community/submarine
/pages/enlistedwomeninsubmarines.aspx.
This information will also be provided during visits to Navy homeports by 
detailers and Enlisted Community Managers (ECMs).
    a.  Non-nuclear Sailors, Command Career Counselors, and commands may also 
contact the submarine non-nuclear ECM office:  LCDR James Drumgole, 901-874-
2082; STSCS(SS) Joseph Hanley, 901-874-4367;

    b.  Nuclear-trained Sailors, Command Career Counselors, and
    commands
