RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces upcoming changes to Special Leave Accrual 
(SLA) policy mandated by reference (a).  The most impactful of the upcoming 
changes is that Service Members will lose any SLA leave in excess of 90 days 
(vice 120 days) on September 30, 2023 unless they had more than 90 days of 
SLA leave on the books on December 31, 2022.  Other anticipated changes are 
that SLA leave will only be held for up to two years (vice three years) and 
that the first flag officer in the chain of command will need to approve SLA 
leave accrual in most cases.

2.  Reference (b) will be updated to reflect the specifics of the new 
requirements soon and will be announced in a separate NAVADMIN.
This notice is intended to allow affected Service Members time to use the 
leave they have earned.  Unit commanders should continue to minimize the loss 
of leave within the constraints of operational requirements.

3.  Point of contact for this matter is Pay and Allowances (OPNAV N130C), at 
(703) 604-5475/DSN 664, or via e-mail at nxag_n130c(@)navy.mil.  Additional 
information can be found at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/References/Pay-
Benefits/N130C/.

4.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or cancelled.  
Updates to references (c) and (d) to reflect changes to SLA leave policy will 
be released at a later date.

5.  Released by Vice Admiral Richard J. Cheeseman, Jr., N1.//
