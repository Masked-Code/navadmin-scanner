REF/A/DOC/DOD/29MAR19//
REF/B/DOC/OPNAV/4JUN09//
NARR/REF A IS DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) NOTICE OF THE EXPANSION OF DOD 
PANEL OF TESTED DRUGS TO INCLUDE FENTANYL AND NORFENTANYL.  
REF B IS OPNAVINST 5350.4D, NAVY ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND 
CONTROL.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the expansion of the Department of Defenses 
ability to conduct random drug testing for the manufactured opiates Fentanyl 
and Norfentanyl.  Members determined as abusing drugs face punitive action 
under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 112a.  Effective 
immediately, Navy Drug Screening Laboratories will add Fentanyl and 
Norfentanyl to the standard drug testing panel for urinalysis samples 
submitted for testing as announced in reference (a).

2.  Navy policy remains clear with regards to substance abuse:  zero 
tolerance.  Sailors determined as using drugs shall be disciplined as 
appropriate and processed for administrative separation and may receive an 
Other than Honorable characterization of service which could affect their 
veteran benefits and employment opportunities.
Additionally, the Navy reports unlawful drug users to the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background Check 
System, which impacts the ability to purchase firearms or ammunition.  It is 
the responsibility of every Sailor to ensure that he or she is diligent in 
avoiding intentional or accidental exposure to federally-prohibited 
substances.

3.  Point of contact is Mrs. LaNorfeia Parker, Director, Navy Drug Detection 
and Deterrence, OPNAV N17, at (901) 874-4249/DSN 882 or via e-mail at 
lanorfeia.parker(at)navy.mil.
