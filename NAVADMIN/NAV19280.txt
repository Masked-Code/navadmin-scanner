APPLICATION ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the merger of active component surface 
ordnance limited duty officers (LDO) and chief warrant officers (CWO) 
designators 616X/716X, into the surface electronics LDO and CWO designators 
618X/718X and announces updates to reference (a).

2.  Sailor 2025 focuses on improving the ability of our Navy to develop, 
reward and retain the force of tomorrow.  With this merger of two related 
designator groups, the Navy will have a larger pool of highly skilled combat 
systems/weapons subject matter experts to match against surface fleet billet 
requirements.

3.  The implementation process will consist of two phases.
    a.  Phase I will begin immediately with the conversion of all 616X/716X 
billets to 618X/718X.
    b.  Phase II will begin approximately 1 month from the date of billet 
conversion and will re-designate all officers.
        (1) Current officers will be re-designated from 616X/716X to 
618X/718X.
        (2) Applicants who have submitted applications to the Fiscal Year 
2021 LDO/CWO In-Service Procurement Board will be considered for selection to 
the 616X/618X or 716X/718X designators as applicable.  Announcement results 
and commissioning documents will reflect 618X/718X.

4.  No administrative action is required by individual officers.

5.  Surface Ordnance CWOs (716X) will continue to wear current designator 
device on the collar, sleeve, and shoulder boards until promoted to their 
next higher paygrade.
