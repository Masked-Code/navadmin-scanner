SUBJ/2020 DOD OPERATIONS SECURITY CAMPAIGN REQUIREMENTS//

REF/A/MEMO/SECDEF/20JUL20//
NARR/REF A IS REINFORCING OPERATIONS SECURITY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF 
PREVENTING UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURES//

RMKS/1.  All Navy military, civilian, and on-site contractor personnel must 
complete Operations Security (OPSEC) training no later than 15 September 
2020.  Echelon II commands send reports of completion to Director of Navy 
Staff (DNS) POC no later than 15 September 2020.

2.  Required Training.  Center for the Development of Security Excellence 
(CDSE) OPSEC Training required by reference (a):
    a.  OPSEC Awareness
    b.  Unauthorized Disclosure of Classified Information for DoD and 
Industry
    c.  Insider Threat Awareness
    d.  Introduction to Information Security

3.  Training is available without login or password at 
https://securityawareness.usalearning.gov/2020-dod-security-stand-down

4.  In lieu of two of the CDSE training courses, Insider Threat Awareness and 
Introduction to Information Security, the equivalent Navy eLearning courses 
DON -CIAR-1.0-NCIS Counterintelligence and Insider Threat Awareness and 
Reporting Training and CSCS-COM-M02-118-CAI-v1-Information Security are 
acceptable.  Both courses are available on Navy eLearning 
(https://learning.nel.navy.mil/ELIAASv2p/) with CAC login.  Use your email 
certificate when accessing the Navy eLearning website.

5.  This is a new training requirement.  Courses completed prior to 20 July 
2020 do not fulfill this requirement.  If operational commitments prevent an 
organization from completing training online, notification shall be sent to 
the Echelon II commander via the chain of command.

6.  Proper OPSEC is critical to protecting our forces, ensuring our mission 
success, and implementing the National Defense Strategy.  Poor OPSEC may lead 
to unnecessary loss of life and mission failure and can mean the difference 
between our winning and losing as we face great power competitors.  Sound 
OPSEC practices are critical to enhancing the Nation's safety, prosperity, 
and competitiveness.

7.  Questions or feedback should be sent via e-mail to CAPT James Toczko at 
james.toczko(AT)navy.mil.

8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until 31 December 2020.
