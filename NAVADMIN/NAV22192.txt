CHAPTER// 
 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  In 1997 the deputy chief of naval operations (logistics) 
implemented a CNO monthly Gold Disk Awards Program.  This program was 
designed to encourage Fleet personnel in the maritime community to develop 
gold disk test routines and repair circuit card assemblies and electronic 
modules.  The resulting benefits have resulted in improved operational 
readiness of a wide range of C5I and HM&E systems in addition to 
significantly improved OPTAR cost avoidance.  The award consists of a letter 
of commendation signed by Deputy CNO for Integration of Capabilities and 
Resources and a military cash award of up to five thousand dollars. 
 
2.  The cash award criteria is a graduated dollar value dependent upon cost 
avoidance thresholds.  The award program not only rewards the top repair 
technician, but every technician that meets the following quarterly cost 
avoidance thresholds: 
$150k to $199k of cost avoidance yields a $2k award 
$200k to $249k of cost avoidance yields a $3k award 
$250k to $299k of cost avoidance yields a $4k award 
$300k and over of cost avoidance yields a $5k award 
 
3.  The CNO Gold Disk Awards Program is administered by the NAVSEA miniature 
Microminiature module test and repair (2M MTR) program manager.  Fleet 2M MTR 
policy and responsibilities are contained in reference (a).  Gold Disk 
Awardees are selected by an awards board at NUWC detachment field engineering 
office in Norfolk.  The MTR engineering agents selection is based on 2M 
repair metrics submitted in the Module Test and Repair tracking system or 
verification of recently submitted gold disk test routines.
