SUBJ/NAVY FAMILY OMBUDSMAN APPRECIATION DAY//

RMKS/1.  I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK ALL THE DEDICATED NAVY 
FAMILY OMBUDSMEN WHO WORK TIRELESSLY TO SUPPORT OUR SAILORS, NAVY CIVILIANS, 
AND THEIR FAMILIES.

2.  LAST YEAR IN MY MESSAGE FOR OMBUDSMAN APPRECIATION DAY, I ADDRESSED HOW 
BUSY OUR NAVY WAS.  IN THE PAST YEAR, THAT PACE HAS INCREASED AND THE EVENTS 
WERE MORE DIVERSE AND DEMANDING.  OUR NAVY OMBUDSMEN ARE THE VITAL LINK 
BETWEEN COMMANDS AND FAMILIES, ALLOWING OUR SAILORS AND NAVY CIVILIANS TO 
FOCUS ON THEIR MISSIONS AND PROTECT OUR NATION.  OMBUDSMEN KEEP THE CHAIN OF 
COMMAND INFORMED ON ISSUES FACING OUR PEOPLE, FROM PAY AND COMPENSATION, TO 
CHILD CARE AND HOUSING, WHILE ALSO PLAYING A MAJOR ROLE IN CRISIS RESPONSE AND 
DISASTER PREPAREDNESS.

3.  ON SEPTEMBER 14TH, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE DEDICATED 
VOLUNTEERS.  I ENCOURAGE ALL COMMANDS TO HOST APPROPRIATE FUNCTIONS THAT 
EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM, VISIT THE NAVY FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTER WEB SITE AT 
WWW.NFFSP.ORG.

4.  AGAIN, THANK YOU TO ALL THE OMBUDSMEN SERVING WORLDWIDE TO SUPPORT OUR 
NAVY FAMILY. 

5.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
