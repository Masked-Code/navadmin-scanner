2.  APPLICANTS ARE SELECTED BASED ON A SNAPSHOT OF QUOTAS OUT AND 
QUOTAS IN BY YEAR GROUP AND COMMUNITY.  NOT BEING SELECTED ON THIS 
BOARD IS NOT REASON TO FEEL YOU HAVE NO CHANCE, APPLY AGAIN (AND AGAIN 
AS REQUIRED), ALL THE WHILE SUSTAINING SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE AND 
BOLSTERING YOUR PACKAGE FOR YOUR DESIRED COMMUNITY.  WHAT MAKES 
YOUR RECORD STANDOUT IS MOTIVATION TOWARDS YOUR GAINING COMMUNITY AS 
WELL AS CONTINUED PROMOTABILITY.
3.  FOR JUNIOR YEAR GROUPS (04 THROUGH 07), THE DEMAND SIGNAL FAR 
EXCEEDED THE SUPPLY POOL.  MANY QUALITY APPLICANTS WERE IDENTIFIED 
BY THE BOARD BUT COULD NOT BE SELECTED DUE TO QUOTA CONSTRAINTS OF 
EITHER OUTGOING COMMUNITY OR GAINING COMMUNITY.  THESE QUOTAS ARE RE-
DETERMINED EVERY 6 MONTHS, FOR EACH BOARD.
4.  AS ALWAYS, COMPETITION FOR REDESIGNATION WAS KEEN AND EVERY 
COMMUNITY HAD A POOL OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES TO SELECT FROM.
ELIGIBLE OFFICERS NOT INITIALLY SELECTED FOR THEIR PRIMARY OR 
SECONDARY CHOICE WERE SUBSEQUENTLY REVIEWED BY ALL OTHER COMMUNITIES 
FOR CONSIDERATION.  THOSE OFFICERS TENTATIVELY SELECTED FOR 
COMMUNITIES NOT INITIALLY REQUESTED WILL BE NOTIFIED VIA OFFICIAL 
CORRESPONDENCE AND OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDESIGNATE.
5.  THE PROCESS WHILE NEVER PERFECT, IS FAIR AND THOROUGH.  BOARD 
MEMBERS ARE FOCUSED ON THEIR TASK - PICKING THE RIGHT CANDIATE - FULLY 
AND BEST QUALIFIED FROM AVAILABLE APPLICANTS.  RECORDS RECEIVE 
A DETAILED SCRUB AND THERE IS THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE DISCUSSIONS ON 
EACH APPLICANT.
6.  THIS MSG IS NOT AUTHORITY TO DELIVER CHANGE OF DESIGNATOR LETTER TO 
THE SELECTEE.
    A.  OFFICERS WHO ARE PROMOTION SELECTEES SHOULD CONTACT THEIR 
CURRENT DETAILER TO DISCUSS REDESIGNATION TIMING.  COMNAVPERSCOM 
(PERS-802), UPON NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) THAT THE 
SELECTEE HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO THEIR NEW COMMUNITY, WILL FORWARD A 
REDESIGNATION LETTER TO THE SELECTEE OR APPOINTMENT ACCEPTANCE AND OATH 
OF OFFICE (NAVPERS 1000/4), AS APPLICABLE.
    B.  OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT PROMOTION SELECTEES AND WHO ARE NOT 
UNDER ORDERS CAN EXPECT ASSIGNMENT TO A NEW BILLET APPROPRIATE TO 
THEIR NEW DESIGNATION WHEN NOTIFIED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4).
    C.  IF A MEMBER IS CURRENTLY UNDER ORDERS AND TRANSFERS PRIOR TO
NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4), MEMBER MUST EXECUTE ORDERS 
UNDER CURRENT DESIGNATOR AND MUST COMPLETE 12 MONTHS AT THE NEW 
ASSIGNMENT, UNLESS A SHORTER TOUR IS PRESCRIBED (TOURS IN EXCESS OF 
ONE YEAR WILL BE WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE GAINING COMMUNITY), PRIOR 
TO REDESIGNATION.
7.  THE FOLLOWING ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE ABOVE:

DEPARTMENT HEAD SCHOOL MAY NOT LATERALLY TRANSFER UNTIL COMPLETION OF

REDESIGNATED 1510 IN ACCORDANCE WITH MILPERSMAN 1212-010, IF SELECTED.  
HOWEVER, IF A SECOND SEA TOUR OR AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD TOUR HAS NOT

COMPLETION OF APPLICABLE SECOND SEA AND/OR AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD 
TOUR, AS DETERMINED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-43).
