RMKS/1.  Congratulations to the following personnel who have been selected 
for temporary (spot) advancement by the FY-20 Senior Enlisted Advancement-to-
Position (A2P) Selection Board.  Strong competition between qualified 
professionals is one of the strengths of our Navy and your selection speaks 
highly of your abilities.  The A2P program is one of a series of talent 
management initiatives intended to improve fleet readiness and manning 
through better distribution of our talent.  Ultimately it will be subsumed by 
the detailing marketplace.

2.  In line with reference (a), selectees will be spot advanced upon arrival 
at the ultimate duty station listed below provided they have met all 
requirements for the billet to which they were selected.  If a Sailor 
transfers from a spot-advanced billet for any reason prior to being 
permanently selected for the next paygrade, the Sailor will revert back to 
their permanent paygrade effective the date of the transfer.  Personnel 
listed below may be frocked in accordance with reference (b) once they have 
completed all prerequisites and enroute training required for the selected 
billet.  The selection list is in alphabetical order by rate.

3.  For selectees, read each line from left to right: spot rank, name, 
command and billet.  Members are directed to verify their select status via 
BUPERS Online.
