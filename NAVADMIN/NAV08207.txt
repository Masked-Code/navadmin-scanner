RMKS/l.  THIS NAVADMIN SUPERSEDES AND CANCELS REFS A AND B, AND 
PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR THE DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT (DHA) PROCESS.
DHA'S ARE DIRECTED FOR SAILORS WHEN THEY EITHER DEPLOY WITH DUTIES 
INVOLVING MORE THAN 30 DAYS ASHORE OCONUS; ARE MEMBERS OF A DEPLOYING 
UNIT OR DEPLOYED INDIVIDUALLY ON THE GROUND TO USCENTCOM AOR; OR DEPLOY, 
REGARDLESS OF DEPLOYMENT AREA OR DURATION, AND THE COMMANDER EXERCISING 
OPERATIONAL CONTROL SPECIFICALLY DETERMINES THAT PERSONNEL UNDER HIS 
COMMAND WERE EXPOSED TO A POTENTIALLY ADVERSE PHYSICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH 
THREAT (E.G., A DEPLOYED SHIP CONDUCTS OPERATIONS THAT EXPOSED SAILORS 
TO CONTAMINANTS, DISEASE, OR TRAUMATIC EVENTS).  PER REF C, PERSONNEL 
WHO ROTATIONALLY DEPLOY WITH SHIPS/SQUADRONS AFLOAT ARE SPECIFICALLY 
EXCLUDED FROM THIS REQUIREMENT UNLESS THEY SERVED MORE THAN 30 DAYS 
WITH BOOTS ON THE GROUND.

2.  THIS NAVADMIN ALSO DIRECTS A ONE-TIME SCREENING OF MEDICAL RECORDS 
FOR DHA COMPLIANCE OF ALL PERSONNEL WHO HAVE COMPLETED AN IA ASSIGNMENT 
IN THE USCENTCOM AOR SINCE OCTOBER 2001.  PROCEDURES FOR ONE-TIME 
SCREENING ARE LISTED BELOW IN PARA 10.

3.  THE DHA PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY STRESS INJURIES AND OTHER 
HEALTH CONCERNS THAT REQUIRE FURTHER ASSESSMENT OR TREATMENT.  DHA IS 
MANDATED BY DOD TO SCREEN SAILORS PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT, TO IDENTIFY 
HEALTH CONCERNS AFTER DEPLOYMENT, AND TO FACILITATE APPROPRIATE CARE.
DHA CONSISTS OF:
A.  PRE-DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT (PRE-DHA, DD FORM 2795), CONDUCTED 
WITHIN 60 DAYS PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT.
B.  POST-DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT (POST-DHA, DD FORM 2796), 
CONDUCTED WITHIN 30 DAYS BEFORE OR AFTER RETURN TO HOME STATION.
C.  POST-DEPLOYMENT HEALTH RE-ASSESSMENT (PDHRA, DD 2900), CONDUCTED 
BETWEEN 90 AND 180 DAYS AFTER RETURN TO HOME STATION.
PDHRA CAN BE DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PERIODIC HEALTH ASSESSMENT IF 
TIME FRAMES COINCIDE.

4.  THE DHA CAPTURES THE NECESSARY DATA TO MONITOR THE HEALTH OF OUR 
SAILORS IN ORDER TO PROACTIVELY IDENTIFY AND MANAGE HEALTH ISSUES.
A.  COMMANDERS, COMMANDING OFFICERS, AND OFFICERS-IN-CHARGE MUST BE 
PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN MONITORING THE DHA PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY 
SAILOR'S CONCERNS AND ISSUES RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE ATTENTION AND 
CONSIDERATION.
B.  COMMAND LEADERSHIP AND MEDICAL PERSONNEL WILL USE THE MEDICAL 
READINESS REPORTING SYSTEM (MRRS) TO TRACK THE DHA PROCESS.
