REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/14DEC09//
AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1420.1B, ENLISTED TO OFFICER COMMISSIONING 
PROGRAMS APPLICATION ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL.//

RMKS/1.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS NAVADMIN IS TO SOLICIT APPLICATIONS AND 
PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR THE FY-13 SEAMAN TO ADMIRAL (STA-21) 
COMMISSIONING PROGRAM.

2.  STA-21 IS A FULL-TIME UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION AND COMMISSIONING 
PROGRAM OPEN TO ENLISTED PERSONNEL OF ALL PAYGRADES AND RATINGS WHO 
MEET ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIED IN REF A AND ON THE STA-21 
WEBSITE UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION LINK.  SELECTEES ARE PROVIDED A 
MAXIMUM OF 36 MONTHS OF FULL-TIME, YEAR-ROUND STUDY TO COMPLETE A 
BACCALAUREATE DEGREE.  PARTICIPANTS WILL REMAIN ON ACTIVE DUTY WHILE 
ATTENDING COLLEGE AND RECEIVE PAY, ALLOWANCES, BENEFITS, AND 
PRIVILEGES OF CURRENT PAYGRADE.  IN ADDITION, SELECTEES WILL RECEIVE 
AN EDUCATION VOUCHER FOR UP TO $10,000 PER YEAR TO COVER TUITION, 
FEES, AND BOOK COSTS.

3.  DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF APPLICATIONS FOR THE FY-13 STA-21 
PROGRAM IS 1 JULY 2012.  HOWEVER, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT 
APPLICATIONS BE MAILED PRIOR TO THE DEADLINE.  APPLICATION PACKAGES 
MUST BE POSTMARKED ON OR BEFORE THE DEADLINE DATE.  EARLY SUBMISSION 
IS BETTER AS THIS WILL ALLOW FEEDBACK TO THE SAILOR FOR SUBMISSION 
OF MISSING OR ILLEGIBLE DOCUMENTS.  DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF 
ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION TO AN APPLICANT'S PACKAGE IS 1 AUGUST 2012.
NO ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS CAN BE ADDED AFTER THIS DATE.  THE SELECTION 
BOARD WILL MEET IN SEPTEMBER 2012.  NAMES OF SELECTEES WILL BE 
ANNOUNCED BY NAVADMIN IN OCTOBER 2012.

4.  LESSONS LEARNED.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ADDRESSES LESSONS 
LEARNED FROM THE FY-12 STA-21 SELECTION PROCESS AND BOARD.  THIS 
INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO PRECLUDE COMMON ERRORS.
    A.  OF 710 APPLICATIONS RECEIVED FOR FY12, ONLY 616 WERE BOARD 
ELIGIBLE.  A TOTAL OF 75 WERE SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FY-12 
STA-21 PROGRAM.
    B.  EACH YEAR, PACKAGES ARE STILL NOT CONSIDERED DUE TO NON-
QUALIFYING SAT/ACT TEST SCORES, NO SAT/ACT TEST SCORES SUBMITTED, NO 
CO ENDORSEMENT, RECENT NJP, MISSING PRT CYCLES, AND MISSING OR 
ILLEGIBLE SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTS.
    C.  MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET BEFORE 
SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION.  THE SELECTION PROCESS IS EXTREMELY 
COMPETITIVE.  APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE MAILED ONLY WHEN FULLY 
COMPLETE.  OFFICER INTERVIEW BOARDS CONSIST OF THREE OFFICERS; THE 
APPLICANT'S CO IS NOT A BOARD MEMBER AND SHOULD NOT SUBMIT AN 
INTERVIEW APPRAISAL SHEET.  THE CO'S PERSONAL INTERVIEW SHOULD ONLY 
BE CONDUCTED AFTER THE APPLICATION IS COMPLETE AND THE OFFICER 
INTERVIEW BOARD HAS SUBMITTED THEIR APPRAISALS.  THE FULL PICTURE OF 
AN APPLICANT'S ACADEMIC AND OFFICER POTENTIAL CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED 
BY REVIEWING THE SAT/ACT SCORES, HIGH SCHOOL/COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS, 
AND A COMPLETED APPLICATION PACKAGE.
    D.  THE CO'S ENDORSEMENT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY THE 
RANKING OF THE INDIVIDUAL AMONG HIS/HER PEERS.  THE ENDORSEMENT 
SHOULD CONTAIN SPECIFICS ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL'S ACADEMIC POTENTIAL, 
COMMITMENT, LEADERSHIP, AND POTENTIAL AS A NAVAL OFFICER.  CO 
COMMENTS SHOULD SPECIFY THE PRIMARY OPTION TO WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL 
IS APPLYING AND ADDRESS HOW THE INDIVIDUAL MEETS QUALIFICATIONS FOR 
THAT OPTION. 
    E.  AN INTERVIEW BOARD AND NOMINATION REVIEW BOARD SHALL BE 
CONDUCTED IAW REF A.  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT OFFICERS OF THE 
APPLICANT'S DESIGNATOR CHOICE, IF AVAILABLE, BE ASKED TO PARTICIPATE 
IN THE INTERVIEW/NOMINATION REVIEW BOARD TO ASSESS THE APPLICANT FOR 
THEIR COMMUNITY.  FOR JUNIOR SAILORS WITH ONLY SCHOOL HOUSE 
EVALUATIONS, THE CO MUST ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN HIS OR HER 
ENDORSEMENT.  OFFICER APPRAISALS PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT ON THE 
APPLICANT.  APPRAISAL FORMS SHOULD BE TYPED IN 10 OR 12 POINT FONT.
    F.  THE APPLICANT'S PERSONAL STATEMENT SHOULD ADDRESS WHY THE 
SAILOR WANTS TO BECOME AN OFFICER, HOW THE SAILOR'S SELECTION WOULD 
IMPROVE THE NAVY, AND WHY THE SAILOR IS APPLYING FOR A SPECIFIC 
OPTION.  SAILORS MUST ALSO ADDRESS ANY HARDSHIPS OR UNIQUE 
EXPERIENCES THAT SHAPED THEIR CHARACTER.  JUNIOR SAILORS SHOULD 
PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCES.  HIGH SCHOOL 
TRANSCRIPTS RARELY PROVIDE IN-DEPTH INFORMATION ON INVOLVEMENT IN 
SPORTS, CLUBS, VOLUNTEER WORK, ETC.  ADDITIONALLY, APPLICANTS SHOULD 
EXPLAIN ANY MITIGATING ISSUES THE BOARD NEEDS TO CONSIDER (I.E. POOR 
HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE GRADES AND UNEXPLAINED GAPS).
    G.  THE APPLICATION IS A REFLECTION OF THE APPLICANT.  
APPLICANTS MUST REVIEW THEIR PACKAGES IN THEIR ENTIRETY BEFORE 
SUBMITTING.  CHECK FOR MISSPELLED WORDS AND GRAMMAR ISSUES AND 
ENSURE ALL TRANSCRIPTS ARE ENCLOSED.  A MINIMUM SCORE OF GOOD ON THE 
LATEST PRT AND QUALIFYING SAT/ACT SCORES ARE REQUIRED.  INCLUDE ANY 
ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS, QUALIFICATIONS, OR OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
AS A PART OF THE PACKAGE.  LET THE SELECTION BOARD KNOW THE WHOLE 
PICTURE. 

5.  THE NAVY NEEDS INNOVATIVE AND BOLD MEN AND WOMEN TO LEAD, THINK 
CREATIVELY, CHALLENGE ASSUMPTIONS AND TAKE WELL-CALCULATED RISKS.  
TODAY'S NAVY IS COMPOSED OF MEN AND WOMEN REPRESENTING DOZENS OF 
DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS AND LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF CULTURAL HERITAGES.  
THE NAVY'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS LEADERSHIP CHALLENGES DEPENDS, IN PART, 
ON HAVING LEADERS FROM OUR ENTIRE NAVY WHO REFLECT OUR VERY BEST.

6.  APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE MAILED TO:
      COMMANDER
      NAVAL SERVICE TRAINING COMMAND (OD2/STA-21)
      250 DALLAS STREET, STE A
      PENSACOLA, FL 32508-5268
