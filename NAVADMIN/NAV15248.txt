by the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED), and assignment by Naval 
Service Training Command (NSTC) to an approved Naval Reserve Officers 
Training Corps (NROTC) affiliated university based upon an official degree 
plan and acceptance letter from the university.  Upon completion of an NSTC 
approved baccalaureate degree program, selectees will receive appointments as 
ensigns, USN.

5.  Commanding officers should take the following actions:

receive a copy of this message.
    b.  Notify NSTC (Officer Development (Selection and Placement) (OD2)/STA-

who does not desire to participate in the program.

that may disqualify a selectee or alternate from participating in the STA-21 
program via e-mail at pnsc_sta21(at)navy.mil.

6.  Selectees and alternates should take the following actions:
    a.  Complete a physical examination for a training program leading to a 
commission in the unrestricted line, nurse corps, or civil engineering corps, 
as applicable, in accordance with references (a) and (b) at a military 
treatment facility.  Note that many commissioning standards exceed the 
enlisted standards required to remain on active duty.
    b.  Ensure copies of completed physicals, Report of Medical History 
(DD2807-1), and Report of Medical Examination (DD2808), including Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus results from a test taken after 1 January 2015, are 
submitted no later than 1 December 2015 to: 

    Naval Service Training Command
    Attn:  OD2/STA-21
    250 Dallas Street, Suite A
    Pensacola, Florida 32508-5268
 
Aviation option selectees/alternates must have flight physicals uploaded 
directly into Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office by a flight surgeon, and 
submitted to Naval Aerospace Medical Institute. The selectees/alternates must 
be certified as qualified or have a waiver recommended by Naval Medicine 
Operation Training Center.  All required physical forms can be downloaded 
from the STA-21 homepage at https://www.sta-21.navy.mil.  Commands should not 
forward physical forms directly to BUMED.
    c.  Send acceptance letters from no more than three NROTC host or NROTC 
cross-town affiliated universities to the NSTC address listed above.  
Application to more than one university is advisable. Selectees will begin 
the STA-21 program with attendance at the Naval Science Institute (NSI) no 
later than 16 February 2016.
    d.  Send an official degree plan from an NROTC host or NROTC cross-town 
affiliated university where they have been accepted. Degree plans must cover 
the time actually attending college. Selectees degree plans should begin with 
the summer term 2016.  All STA-21 selectees will be required to attend the 
NSI enroute to their assigned university.

7.  Alternates:  While there is no guarantee that an alternate will be 
offered the opportunity to replace a primary selectee, each alternate must 
complete the same actions outlined in paragraph 6 of this message.  If a 
primary selectee declines participation in the program, is determined to be 
physically disqualified, or otherwise becomes ineligible for continuation in 
the program prior to executing orders, a qualified alternate will be 
selected.  This notification often comes at the last minute; therefore, 
alternates need to be prepared when notified.

8.  The deadline for required degree plans and college admission 
documentation is 18 December 2015.  It is in the best interest of each 
selectee and alternate to submit verification of eligibility criteria as soon 
as possible to expedite university assignment and release of permanent change 
of station orders.  Selectees will not be ordered to NSI enroute to their 
assigned NROTC university until all conditions outlined in paragraph 6 have 
been met.
