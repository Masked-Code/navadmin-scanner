SUBJ/FY09 PCS CLOSE-OUT//
RMKS/1.  THE RECENT RESTORATION OF PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION (PCS) 
FUNDS ALLOWS NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (NPC) TO PROVIDE PCS ORDERS TO ALL 
SAILORS WITH IDENTIFIED FY09 ROTATION DATES.  UNFORTUNATELY, REMAINING 
FY09 PCS FUNDS COMBINED WITH THE POLICY THAT REQUIRES FUNDS BE 
OBLIGATED WHEN ORDERS ARE ISSUED WILL ONLY ALLOW US TO ISSUE 
APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT OF ORDERS FOR THOSE WITH A PROJECTED ROTATION 
DATE (PRD) IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FY10.  ONCE WE RECEIVE FISCAL YEAR 
2010 FUNDS, WE WILL RELEASE THE REMAINING FIRST QUARTER ORDERS IN EARLY 
OCTOBER 2009.
2.  WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO PROVIDING SAILORS WITH AS MUCH INFORMATION 
AND LEAD TIME AS POSSIBLE.  THIS TIMING WILL RESULT IN COMPRESSED PCS 
TIMELINES FOR SOME SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES WITH PRD IN OCT-DEC 2009. 
3.  WORKING IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH ENTERPRISE MANPOWER AUTHORITIES, 
PERS-4 WILL CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THE SAME PRIORITIZATION STRATEGIES USED 
DURING THE PREVIOUS TEMPORARY PCS HOLD TO MINIMIZE IMPACTS TO FLEET 
READINESS, CAREER TIMING, AND FAMILIES.  EMPHASIS REMAINS ON GLOBAL 
SUPPORT ASSIGNMENT ROTATIONS, CAREER MILESTONE BILLETS AND CRITICAL 
READINESS FILLS, MINIMIZING GAPS AT SEA FOR DEPLOYED UNITS AND THOSE 
WORKING UP TO DEPLOY, AND KEEPING THE TRAINING PIPELINES MOVING.  
SAILORS IN THE PROCESS OF ORDERS NEGOTIATION, THOSE WITH A PRD IN FIRST 
QUARTER FY10, OR THOSE WHO OTHERWISE WILL BE AFFECTED BY THIS SHORTFALL 
SHOULD CONTACT THEIR DETAILER DIRECTLY TO DISCUSS THEIR SPECIFIC 
SITUATION.
4.  THANK YOU FOR PATIENCE AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON THIS IMPORTANT AND 
CHALLENGING EFFORT TO MANAGE OUR PCS ACCOUNTS. 
5.  GENERAL QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO 1-866-U-ASK-NPC (1-866-827-
5672).  DETAILERS ARE STANDING BY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO EACH 
SAILOR'S SITUATION.
