RMKS/1.  The Navy is pleased to announce the selection of the following 
Sailors for training and assignment as the third cohort of enlisted female 
submariners.  The interest in this program was strong, and selection was 
highly competitive.  Consistent superior performance, operational experience, 
and strong command endorsements were critical in breaking out these high 
performing Sailors from their peers.  The following list of Sailors are the 
primary selectees.

2.  Congratulations to the following Sailors who were selected for assignment 
to USS OHIO (SSGN 726) homeported in Bangor, WA:

3.  Primary selectees should have completed the Report of Medical History (DD 
Form 2807-1) and Report of Medical Examination (DD Form 2808) with Undersea 
Medical Officer review in line with reference (a).  Any selectee with 
outstanding medical waivers should contact the Submarine Non-Nuclear Enlisted 
Community Manager and provide an expected timeline for completion within 30 
days of the date time group of this message.

4.  Enlisted Nuclear/Submarine Assignment Division (PERS-403) will contact 
primary selectees within the next 30 days to arrange for transfer to Basic 
Enlisted Submarine School to commence the submarine training pipeline.  
Depending on the rating for which they were selected, Sailors can expect to 
detach from their current commands from as early as Fall 2017 to as late as 
Spring 2018.

5.  Congratulations to the following Sailors also selected, who may be 
contacted to convert to submarines if a primary selectee is unable to report 
as assigned:

6.  Sailors listed in paragraph 5 may be called upon within 90 days to fill 
an assignment on USS OHIO if a primary selectee is determined to be 
ineligible for assignment onboard submarines.

7.  The selections for nuclear-trained personnel will be made late Summer 
2018.  Each USS OHIO crew will have two previous junior staff instructors 
(JSI) and four prototype graduates.  These Sailors will transfer to the 
submarine from the nuclear power training units (NPTU) in late 2018 after the 
selections are made.  Female JSIs or Sailors in initial training interested 
in volunteering for submarine duty should inform their chain of command.  In 
early 2018, Nuclear Propulsion Program Manager (OPNAV (N133)) will send a 
letter to each NPTU outlining the selection process.

8.  Points of contact.  For Enlisted Women in Submarines questions, commands
