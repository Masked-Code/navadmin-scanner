4.  Selections are conditional upon the selectee remaining fully eligible in 
all respects, meeting physical qualifications for commissioning as determined 
by the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) and assignment by Naval Service 
Training Command (NSTC) to an approved Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps 
(NROTC) affiliated university based upon an official degree plan and 
acceptance letter from the university.  Upon completion of an NSTC approved 
baccalaureate degree program, selectees will receive appointments as ensigns.

5.  Commanding Officers should take the following actions:
    a.  Notify selectees and alternates of their selection and ensure they 
receive a copy of this message.
    b.  Notify NSTC (NROTC Programs (Selection and Placement)
(N92)/STA-21) via message no later than (NLT) 13 November 2019 of any 
selectee or alternate who does not desire to participate in the program.
    c.  Immediately report to NSTC (N92/STA-21) all conditions/ circumstances 
that may disqualify a selectee or alternate from participating in the STA-21 
program via e-mail at pnsc_sta21(at)navy.mil.

6.  Selectees and alternates should take the following actions:
    a.  Complete a physical examination for a training program leading to a 
commission in the unrestricted line, nurse corps, or civil engineering corps, 
as applicable, in accordance with references (a) and (b) at a military 
treatment facility.  Note that many commissioning standards exceed the 
enlisted standards required to remain on active-duty.
    b.  Ensure copies of completed physicals, Report of Medical History 
(DD2807-1) and Report of Medical Examination (DD2808), including Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus results from a test taken after 1 January 2019, are 
submitted NLT 1 December 2019
to:
    Naval Service Training Command
    Attn:  N92/STA-21
    250 Dallas Street, Suite A
    Pensacola, Florida 32508-5268

Aviation option selectees/alternates must have flight physicals uploaded 
directly into the Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office by a flight surgeon, 
and submitted to the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute.  The 
selectees/alternates must be certified as qualified or have a waiver 
recommended by Naval Medicine Operation Training Center.  All required 
physical forms can be downloaded from the STA-21 homepage via MyNavy Portal 
at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning/commissioning-
programs.  Commands should not forward physical forms directly to BUMED.
    c.  Send acceptance letters from no more than three NROTC host or NROTC 
cross-town affiliated universities to the NSTC address listed above.  
Application to more than one university is advisable.
Selectees will begin the STA-21 program with attendance at the Naval Science 
Institute (NSI) NLT 17 February 2020.
    d.  Send an official degree plan from an NROTC host or NROTC cross-town 
affiliated university where they have been accepted.
Degree plans must cover the time actually attending college.
Selectees degree plans should begin with the summer term 2020.  All STA-21 
selectees will be required to attend the NSI enroute to their assigned 
university.

7.  Each alternate must complete the same actions outlined in paragraph 6 of 
this message.  If a primary selectee declines participation in the program, 
is determined to be physically disqualified, or otherwise becomes ineligible 
for continuation in the program prior to executing orders, a qualified 
alternate will be selected.  This notification often comes at the last 
minute; therefore, alternates need to be prepared when notified.

8.  The deadline for required degree plans and college admission 
documentation is 31 December 2019.  It is in the best interest of each 
selectee and alternate to submit verification of eligibility criteria as soon 
as possible to expedite university assignment and release of permanent change 
of station orders.  Selectees will not be ordered to NSI enroute to their 
assigned NROTC university until all conditions outlined in paragraph 6 have 
been met.

9.  Points of contact are Mrs. Anna Duvall at (850) 452-9433/DSN 459 or via 
e-mail at anna.duvall(at)navy.mil or Mr. Eric Hodge at (850) 452-9563/DSN 459
