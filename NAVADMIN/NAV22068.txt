RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 Training and
Administration of the Reserve (TAR) Aviation Command Retention Bonus (ACRB)
in line with references (a) and (b).
 
2.  The FY-22 TAR ACRB is designed to retain those officers with the
capabilities and command experience in our primary warfighting missions that
are critical for the future of our service.  Our cadre of commander (CDR)
commanding officers (CO) lead our Naval Aviation Enterprise today and they
are the major commanders and flag officers of tomorrow.  Their skills and
leadership experience are essential to the success of the Navy.  The FY-22
TAR ACRB incentivizes their continued service in follow-on assignments
requiring senior aviation leaders.
    a.  FY-22 TAR ACRB applicants must have screened on the FY-22 Aviation
Command Screen Board (ACSB) as CO of an eligible operational, operational
training, or special mission CDR command in order to apply.  Eligible
commands are those for which the annual ACSB selects officers to serve as
CO, excluding second-in-grade, sequential, bonus or fleet replacement
squadron commands.  Consult the FY-22 TAR ACRB Program information for
specific eligibility criteria and limitations.  The application opportunity
commences with the release of this NAVADMIN and closes on 31 August 2022.
    b.  All FY-22 TAR ACRB contracts will be worth $100,000.
Eligible officers will receive an initial payment of $34,000 and 2
anniversary payments of $33,000.  Participation in the FY-22 TAR ACRB
obligates contractees to 3 years of obligated service to include full
completion of a post commander command (PCC) tour, which may be between 24
and 36 months depending on assignment.  ACRB obligation ends at the
completion of 22 years of service, the projected rotation date of the
assigned PCC tour, or 3 years from contract acceptance date, whichever is
later.  ACRB applications for those currently under the Aviation Department
Head Retention Bonus (ADHRB) obligations will be accepted, held in abeyance 
and activated upon ADHRB contract expiration.
 
3.  Additional ACRB Information
    a.  Officers accepting ACRB contracts are not precluded from 
participating in the Career Intermission Program (CIP).  Officers interested 
in both ACRB and CIP should contact the ACRB Program manager and their 
detailer for more information.
    b.  For further ACRB details, eligibility and application procedures,
