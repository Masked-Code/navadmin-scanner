RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN reminds eligible Sailors that there are only a few 
weeks left until the blended retirement system (BRS) enrollment period comes 
to a close.  As previously announced in references (a) through (g), the BRS 
enrollment period will remain open until 31 December 2018.  During this 
period, opt-in eligible Service members may enroll in the BRS via the *myPay* 
website.  Opt- in eligible Service members who do not choose to enroll in BRS 
will remain in the current *legacy* retirement system.  If a Service member 
elects to enroll in the BRS, that election is irrevocable.
Only those Sailors that have been granted an extension in line with Article 
1810-080 of reference (h) are allowed to opt-in after
31 December 2018.

2.  Command leaders are responsible for ensuring that opt-in eligible Service 
members are prepared to make an informed financial decision prior to the 
closure of the opt-in window.  Ensuring Sailors have the education and 
training tools needed to make the right decision for their situation is the 
job of command mentors, one of the six elements of being *Brilliant on the 
Basics* for retention, and is covered in NAVADMINs 095/18, 100/18 and 043/08.
This responsibility to educate and train Service members continues even after 
they have made the decision to opt-in.  Current reports show that there are 
some Service members who have opted in to BRS but are not making 
contributions to their thrift savings plan (TSP) account and are therefore 
not receiving government matching for their TSP.  Leaders should encourage 
members in this situation to work with their command financial specialist or 
a financial counselor to review their personal budget options to maximize 
their TSP contributions.

3.  Commands should notify all opt-in eligible Service members within their 
command that there are only a few weeks left in the BRS enrollment period.  
To enable this notification, the career information management system (CIMS) 
command career counselor (CCC) or command pay and personnel administrator 
(CPPA) can certify the list of all opt-in eligible Service members within 
their command by running a command BRS eligibility report in Navy Standard 
Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).
    a.  The functionality to run and print the BRS eligibility report for a 
command is assigned to the roles of CIMS CCC and CPPA in NSIPS.  Procedures 
to run the reports are provided in the BRS tutorial job performance aid (JPA) 
on the NSIPS home page as
follows:
        (1) Navigate to the NSIPS login Page at 
https://nsipsprod.nmci.navy.mil/.
        (2) Under Training:  select BRS tutorial JPA.
        (3) Under BRS User Roles:  select command roles.
        (4) Select:  CPPA or CCC as applicable.
        (5) Select applicable reports from the drop down menu then follow the 
procedures as listed.

4.  BRS information can be found on the Navy BRS page at
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/support/21st_Century_Sailor/readiness/Pages/Personal-Financial-
Management.aspx.

5.  As stated in references (b) through (g), the opt-in decision may be the 
most important financial decision a member makes in their Navy career.  A 
concerted effort by the Navy Total Force must be made to ensure that opt-in 
eligible Service members understand the opt-in decision and are equipped to 
make this decision prior to the closure of the opt-in period on 31 December 
2018.
