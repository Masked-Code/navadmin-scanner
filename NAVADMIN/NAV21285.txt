RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN reinforces policy set forth in references (a) 
through (g) and is intended to provide information and guidance to 
reinforce procedures for using the government travel charge card 
(GTCC) during permanent change of station (PCS) travel.  This 
NAVADMIN specifically: 
    a.  Provides Service Members, command administrative 
professionals and command leadership teams with information on 
common and reoccurring issues associated with the use of the GTCC 
during a PCS move. 
    b.  Helps mitigate pitfalls and friction points associated with 
misinterpretation of policy and procedures for using the GTCC with 
PCS moves. 
 
2.  Reference (b) introduced the use of the GTCC for PCS.  Continued 
analysis of program efficacy indicates program controls and 
procedures require reinforcement at all levels of engagement. 
 
3.  It is imperative that Service Members, command pay and personnel 
administrators (CPPA), agency program coordinators (APC) and command 
leadership clearly understand their roles and take actions necessary 
to help mitigate potential outstanding PCS travel debt. 
    a.  Commands are responsible for the timely processing of 
Service Members PCS travel claim vouchers. 
    b.  Individual cardholders are responsible for timely and full 
payment of their GTCC balance. 
 
4.  Accurate and timely submission of PCS travel claim vouchers 
    a.  In line with reference (d), PCS travel claim voucher 
submission is mandatory and must be filed within five working days 
upon arrival to the permanent duty station (PDS). 
    b.  CPPAs shall ensure PCS travel claim vouchers are submitted 
within five working days of arrival.  The chain of command and the 
Service Member shall follow-up with their CPPA for status of their 
PCS travel claim voucher if not paid within 20 days of reporting to 
their PDS. 
    c.  GTCC accounts become past due or delinquent simply due to 
the *split disbursement* option not checked on the PCS travel claim 
voucher.  To reduce the potential for late or insufficient payment 
to Citibank, CPPAs shall ensure *split disbursement* is annotated on 
the travel claim voucher or subvoucher (DD form 1351-2) and include 
the total amount charged to the GTCC in the applicable field on the 
form when GTCC is used for a PCS move. 
    d.  Incomplete PCS travel claim vouchers significantly impede 
the timeliness of payments and contribute to PCS travel claim 
voucher rejections.  CPPAs shall verify all applicable blocks on the 
PCS travel claim voucher are marked correctly prior to submission of 
PCS travel claim voucher for payment.  All signatures, key 
supporting receipts and documents must be submitted with the PCS 
travel claim voucher. 
    e.  Service Members are strongly encouraged to use MyPCS Mobile 
to promote accuracy and timely processing of PCS travel claim 
vouchers.  As discussed in reference (c), tools such as the PCS 
entitlements calculator and the MyPCS Travel Claim Voucher are 
located in MyPCS Mobile under the Assignment, Leave and Travel tile. 
Access MyPCS Mobile on the Navy App Locker at 
https://www.applocker.navy.mil/#!/apps or MyNavy Portal website at 
https://my.navy.mil/. 
 
5.  GTCC account management 
    a.  Service Members shall check-out with the APC at the losing 
command and check-in with the APC at their gaining command to ensure 
the APCs have the Service Members cell phone number and e-mail 
address.  Upon check-out, APCs shall: 
        (1) Counsel cardholders on proper use of the GTCC and 
provide contact information for any issues experienced with the card 
while on official travel. 
        (2) Verify the Service Members GTCC is active and in good 
standing. 
        (3) Verify the credit limit has been adjusted to support 
travel and account is placed in mission critical (PCS/MC) status. 
    b.  Upon check-in, the gaining command APC shall: 
        (1) Ensure the Service Members GTCC is added to their 
hierarchy. 
        (2) Advise the cardholder to update their contact 
information and address in Citimanager.  If the cardholder does not 
have a Citimanager account, the APC should make the necessary 
changes or assist the cardholder in creating an account. 
        (3) Advise cardholders to split-disburse their PCS travel 
claim voucher and review their GTCC statement to ensure the card 
balance is zero at final settlement. 
    c.  APCs shall maintain purview over Service Members accounts, 
however, Service Members must self-register on 
https://home.cards.citidirect.com/CommercialCard/login for access to 
Citimanager in order to view 
their expenditures and to receive online GTCC statements. 
    d.  To ensure the GTCC is paid in full, upon PCS travel claim 
voucher liquidation Service Members shall review their Travel Advice 
of Payment in MyPay.  If the split payment was not applied, zero 
(00) dollars will be reflected under the *GOVT charge card payment* 
and the Service Member must ensure the total card balance is paid. 
If split disbursement was applied but the *GOVT charge card payment* 
reflects an amount lesser than the total amount charged to the card, 
the Service Member must pay the remaining card balance.  To prevent 
financial hardship, Service Members must not spend the funds 
dispersed to an individual bank account without first ensuring the 
amount is correct and the GTCC balance is paid in full. 
 
6.  Mission Critical - PCS (MC/PCS) status 
    a.  Accounts are placed in a MC/PCS status while a Service 
Member is traveling to their new PDS.  MC/PCS status protects the 
Service Member from any payments being due on the GTCC until 60 days 
after reporting to the ultimate PDS. 
    b.  Citibank program limitations only allow accounts to be in a 
MC/PCS status for 120 days at a time.  Most accounts will be placed 
in a MC/PCS status only for the duration of the travel time from PDS 
to PDS which may be less than 120 days total. 
    c.  To prevent the Citibank bill from being due prior to the 
member reporting to their PDS, Service Members experiencing travel 
delays or with orders with travel in excess of 120 days must contact 
their detaching command APC or the MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) at 
833-330-MNCC or 901-874-MNCC to have their MC/PCS status extended. 
    d.  APCs and MNCC shall provide Service Members with their 
MC/PCS status expiration date.  Failure to extend the account in 
MC/PCS status may result in the Service Member being placed in a 
past due or delinquent status and ultimately lead to loss of GTCC 
privileges and potential damage to personal credit rating. 
 
7.  As discussed in reference (b) and to prevent overpayment and 
indebtedness, travel advances shall not be authorized for Service 
Members using the GTCC during their PCS except to support non- 
concurrent travel of dependents.  If dislocation allowance (DLA) is 
received as an advance, then the GTCC shall not be used for DLA 
expenses. 
 
8.  As with any new program, awareness of applicable regulations, 
education and training are paramount to mitigate stress on Service 
Members and their families who choose to serve in the Navy.  Command 
leadership must implement PCS travel claim voucher submission best 
practices to ensure their Service Members remain at high levels of 
operational readiness.  All Service Members who used their GTCC for 
PCS travel or commands who processed PCS travel claim vouchers with 
GTCC use are encouraged to provide feedback via the following link 
at https://surveys.max.gov/737856?lang=en. 
 
9.  Adherence to the guidance contained herein can eliminate or 
mitigate any unnecessary stress on Sailors using the GTCC for their 
PCS move.  Active involvement at the command level is paramount to 
assist Sailors with the familiarization of this process, timely 
liquidation of travel claims and reducing past-due or account 
delinquencies. 
 
10.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
