RMKS/1.  The Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Maintenance Awards Program 
enhances maintenance excellence by formally recognizing field-level military 
units responsible for outstanding achievements in maintenance management and 
production.  SECDEF presents six Service-wide maintenance awards annually to 
the most outstanding large, medium, and small department of defense 
maintenance organizations.  One of these six winners is then recognized as 
the best of the best and is awarded the SECDEF Phoenix Trophy. 

2.  Competitive Categories:
    A.  Large:  1000 or more authorized
    B.  Medium: 301-999 authorized personnel
    C.  Small:  up to 300 authorized personnel

3.  All field-level commands, units, and reserve components responsible for 
organizational and intermediate-level maintenance on weapons systems and/or 
equipment belonging to their own unit, or to other units, are eligible to 
compete.  Examples of eligible activities include ships, squadrons, Fleet 
Readiness Centers, Naval Stations, etc.  A component of a command such as a 
repair department of a submarine base may be nominated if that component is 
assigned a Unit Identification Code (UIC) distinct from the command as a 
whole.  The preponderance of unit staffing shall be comprised of uniformed 
U.S. military personnel and may also include DoD civilians.  The 2014 SECDEF 
maintenance award competitive period covers fiscal year 2013.  The 2014 
awards will be presented at a formal ceremony at a date to be announced.

4.  Echelon II commanders shall review and screen nominations from their 
respective commands and may submit up to two SECDEF maintenance award 
nominations per category to OPNAV.  OPNAV will evaluate the nominations and 
forward two nominees per category to SECDEF for award consideration.

5.  Nomination packages shall be submitted IAW references (a) and (b) to Ms. 
Liz Nelson no later than 17 March 2014.  Each nomination package shall 
include a high resolution image of their unit logo (minimum of 300 DPI JPG 
file).  Special attention must be paid to reference (b) as it includes 
updates to page count and grading rubric.  Packages are now restricted to no 
more than ten (10) pages while the grading rubric now includes only three 
categories.  Nominations should highlight accomplishments exceeding existing 
baselines to show how each unit has gone over and above the normal.  Follow-
on messages will announce Navy nominees and award winners.
