SUBJ/SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS (SRB)// 
REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/30JAN2007// AMPN/REF A IS SRB PROGRAM INSTRUCTION 
(OPNAVINST 1160.8A).// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES REVISED SRB AWARD LEVELS FOR THE 
REGULAR COMPONENT AND RESERVE COMPONENT FULL TIME SUPPORT (FTS) AND 
SUPERSEDES NAVADMIN 125/07.  INCREASED AWARD LEVELS ARE EFFECTIVE 
IMMEDIATELY.  POLICIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES IN REF A AND THE 
DEFENSE JOINT MILITARY PAY SYSTEM (DJMS) PROCEDURES TRAINING GUIDE 
REMAIN IN EFFECT.
2.  THE SRB PROGRAM ENHANCES NAVY'S ABILITY TO SIZE, SHAPE AND 
STABILIZE THE FORCE BY USING A MONETARY INCENTIVE TO ENCOURAGE SAILORS 
WITH CRITICAL SKILLS AND VALUABLE EXPERIENCE TO STAY NAVY. 
ADDITIONALLY, SRB IS A MARKET-BASED INCENTIVE THAT ALLOWS ENLISTED 
COMMUNITY MANAGERS THE ABILITY TO STRATEGICALLY ADJUST AWARD LEVELS AS 
RETENTION NEEDS DICTATE, WHILE RESPONSIBLY STEWARDING FISCAL RESOURCES 
IN TIME OF WAR.  DOING SO GIVES NAVY THE ABILITY TO RETAIN THE RIGHT 
MIX OF SKILLED AND MOTIVATED SAILORS WHO ARE CRUCIAL TO OUR MISSION 
SUCCESS TODAY AND READINESS TOMORROW. 
3.  THE FOLLOWING GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED ON NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION 
(NEC) SPECIFIC SRB AND LATERAL CONVERSIONS. 
ACCEPTANCE OF A NEC SPECIFIC SRB CONTRACT INDICATES AWARENESS OF AN 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SAILOR AND NAVY TO UTILIZE THE SKILLS ATTRIBUTED 
TO THE NEC DURING THE SAILOR'S ENLISTMENT TO MEET FLEET READINESS 
REQUIREMENTS.  IN SUBSEQUENT TOURS, A SAILOR MUST BE WILLING TO BE 
DETAILED DURING THE NORMAL PROJECTED ROTATION DATE WINDOW TO A BILLET 
AVAILABLE WITHIN THE SRB CONTRACTED NEC, CONSISTENT WITH SEA-SHORE 
ROTATION REQUIREMENTS.
4.  INFORMATION ON INCREASED AND DECREASED AWARD LEVELS. 
     A.  AN ELIGIBLE SAILOR WITH A COMNAVPERSCOM APPROVED SRB REQUEST 
WHO HAS NOT YET REENLISTED OR EXECUTED AN SRB QUALIFYING EXTENSION AND 
WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM A HIGHER AWARD LEVEL UNDER THIS PLAN WILL BE 
REAPPROVED USING THE NEW AWARD LEVELS.  SAILORS SHOULD ALLOW AT LEAST 
ONE FULL WORKING DAY FOR THE REPROGRAMMING OF THE OFFICER PERSONNEL 
INFORMATION SYSTEM (OPINS) WITH THE NEW AWARD LEVELS. 
ONCE OPINS IS REPROGRAMMED, ALL OF THE AFFECTED APPROVALS WILL BE 
UPDATED BY PERS-811 AND NEW APPROVAL MESSAGES WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO 
THE SAILOR?S COMMAND.  ALLOW THREE WORKING DAYS FOR THESE NEW MESSAGES 
TO REACH COMMANDS PRIOR TO CONTACTING THE SRB DESK. 
     B.  A SAILOR IN A SKILL LISTED FOR REDUCTION OR TERMINATION OF 
AWARD LEVEL WHO HAS AN APPROVAL MESSAGE OR A PENDING PRECERT FOR A 
REENLISTMENT DATE AFTER 1 NOVEMBER 2007 MUST RESUBMIT A REENLISTMENT 
REQUEST FOR A NEW REENLISTMENT DATE PRIOR TO 1 NOVEMBER 2007 TO BE 
ELIGIBLE FOR THE HIGHER AWARD LEVEL. 
5.  PERFORM-TO-SERVE (PTS) REQUIREMENTS.  AN SRB REQUEST FOR A SAILOR 
WHO REQUIRES PTS APPROVAL WILL BE SUBMITTED AFTER THE SAILOR HAS BEEN 
OFFICIALLY NOTIFIED OF THE PTS APPROVAL.  THE STATUS OF PTS APPROVAL 
MAY BE VIEWED THROUGH OPINS IN THE ESTIMATED DATE OF LOSS TO NAVY (EDLN) 
FIELD OF THE I31 SCREEN.
6.  REENLISTMENT PROCEDURES.  SAILORS MAY REQUEST TO REENLIST FOR SRB 
AT ANY TIME WITHIN THE SAME FISCAL YEAR AS THEIR EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE 
OBLIGATED SERVICE (EAOS) (SEE REFERENCE (A), PARAGRAPH 12 FOR 
EXCEPTIONS).  IT IS RECOMMENDED FOR SAILORS TO REENLIST AS CLOSE AS 
POSSIBLE TO THEIR EAOS TO PRESERVE THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF THEIR SRB 
PAYMENT.  BECAUSE SRB IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF MONTHS FOR 
WHICH A SAILOR REENLISTS BEYOND HIS OR HER CURRENT EAOS, REENLISTING 
EARLY REDUCES THE SRB PAYMENT.
7.  OBLIGATE SERVICE TO TRAIN (OTT) AND THEN REENLIST.  SEE REFERENCE 
(A), PARAGRAPH 12E FOR OTT GUIDANCE.
8.  COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES
    A.  A COMMAND MUST SUBMIT AN SRB REQUEST VIA OPINS BETWEEN 35- 120 
DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE SAILOR?S EAOS OR REENLISTMENT DATE TO ENSURE THE 
APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL MESSAGE WILL REACH THE SAILOR'S COMMAND AND THE 
DEFENSE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING SERVICE BEFORE THE REENLISTMENT DATE.  
TIMELINESS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE THE APPROVED PRECERTIFICATION (COMMONLY 
KNOWN AS A PRECERT) NOTIFIES THE DJMS OF THE SAILOR?S INTENT TO 
REENLIST, PREVENTS INTERRUPTION OF PAY, AND ENSURES THE INITIAL SRB 
PAYMENT POSTS TO THE SAILOR'S ACCOUNT. 
SAILORS MUST HAVE APPROVED PRECERTS BEFORE REENLISTING, THOUGH THEY MAY 
WAIT UNTIL THEIR EAOS TO REENLIST.  THE SERVICING PERSONNEL OFFICE IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING THE REENLISTMENT, POSTING THE CONTRACT AND 
RELEASING THE FIRST PAYMENT.
    B.  COMMANDS INITIATING SRB PRECERTS MUST ENSURE ALL OF THE DATA 
INCLUDED IN THE PRECERT REQUEST IS CORRECT AND THE SAILOR IS ELIGIBLE 
TO REENLIST FOR THE REQUESTED SRB.
    C.  A SAILOR WITH AN APPROVED PRECERT WHO DOES NOT REENLIST ON THE 
DATE OR FOR THE TERM SPECIFIED ON THE PRECERT MESSAGE MUST HAVE THEIR 
COMMAND CONTACT PERS-811F TO INITIATE A REENLISTMENT CANCELLATION TO 
AVOID PLACING THE SAILOR IN AN OVERPAID STATUS.
9.  CANCELLATION OF INOPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  ANY SAILOR MAY CANCEL UP 
TO 24 MONTHS OF AN INOPERATIVE EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT PROVIDED:
    A.  CANCELLATION OF THE EXTENSION IS AUTHORIZED BY PERS-811 BEFORE 
IT BECOMES OPERATIVE.
     B.  THE SAILOR IMMEDIATELY REENLISTS FOR AT LEAST 24 MONTHS BEYOND 
THE EXTENDED EAOS, DAY-FOR-DAY.  THE CANCELLED, INOPERATIVE EXTENSION 
WILL COUNT AGAINST THE CALCULATION OF A SAILOR'S SRB AWARD UNLESS THE 
REENLISTMENT IS FOR GREATER THAN THE PERIOD OF THE INOPERATIVE 
EXTENSION PLUS 24 MONTHS DAY-FOR-DAY.
10.  PRECERT REQUIREMENTS.  THE FOLLOWING ARE REQUIRED WHEN SUBMITTING 
PRECERT REQUESTS:
    A.  TO VALIDATE AN INOPERATIVE EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT AND TO 
EXPEDITE PROCESSING OF AN SRB REQUEST, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN THE 
REMARKS PARAGRAPH OF THE REQUEST:  TERM, NARRATIVE REASON, AUTHORITY, 
AND EXECUTION DATE OF ALL INOPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  FAILURE TO VERIFY 
EXTENSIONS MAY CAUSE PROCESSING DELAYS AND RESULT IN REJECTION OF THE 
REQUEST OR AN APPROVAL AT A LOWER AMOUNT.
    B.  A CONDITIONAL EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT (ANY EXTENSION LESS THAN 
24 MONTHS) MUST MEET THE REASONS AND TERMS SPECIFIED IN REF A AND 
MILPERSMAN 1160-040, AND MUST BE APPROVED BY PERS-811.  SAILORS MUST 
OBTAIN AN APPROVAL FOR EXTENSION FROM PERS-811F IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE 
THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF SRB ELIGIBILITY.
    C.  PERSONNEL IN A CLOSED LOOP NEC CAN REENLIST BY THE NEC ONLY.
11.  LITTORAL COMBAT SHIP (LCS) GUIDANCE.  SAILORS ASSIGNED TO LCS 
PLATFORMS OR WITH ORDERS TO AN LCS PLATFORM WHO POSSESS AN NEC 
SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED FOR LCS ASSIGNMENT (I.E., SO-CALLED HYBRID
SAILORS) ARE AUTHORIZED TO REENLIST FOR THE MORE LUCRATIVE SRB- 
ELIGIBLE NEC, REGARDLESS OF ASSIGNED RATING.
12.  REVISED AWARD PLAN
    A.  A "-" SYMBOL PRECEDING AN AWARD LEVEL INDICATES A DECREASE TO 
THAT AWARD LEVEL FOR THAT SPECIFIC ZONE.  A "+" SYMBOL PRECEDING AN 
AWARD LEVEL FOR A SPECIFIC ZONE OR PRECEDING A RATING INDICATES AN 
INCREASE TO THAT AWARD LEVEL AND/OR CEILING FOR THAT SPECIFIC ZONE OR 
THE ADDITION OF THE RATING TO THE SRB AWARD PLAN.
    B.  THE FOLLOWING RATINGS AND NEC?S ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR CONTINUED 
SUCCESS IN THE ONGOING GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM (GWOT) AND NAVY REMAINS 
COMMITTED TO ENSURING WE RETAIN THESE KEY SAILORS.  SEE PARAGRAPH 13
