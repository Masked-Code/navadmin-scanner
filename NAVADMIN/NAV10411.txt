RMKS/1.  FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE TODAY OF A PROVISION AUTHORIZING 
THE REPEAL OF SECTION 654 OF TITLE 10, UNITED STATES CODE, COMMONLY REFERRED 
TO AS "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" (DADT), THERE ARE SERIES OF STEPS THAT MUST TAKE 
PLACE BEFORE REPEAL CAN OCCUR.
AT THIS TIME, THERE ARE NO CHANGES TO EXISTING DEPARTMENT OR SERVICE POLICIES.

2.  THE FIRST STEP IS TO PREPARE THE NECESSARY POLICIES AND REGULATIONS TO 
IMPLEMENT THE CHANGE.  ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL ENSURE OUR MEN AND WOMEN ARE 
PROVIDED TRAINING ON THESE NEW POLICIES.  YOU CAN ANTICIPATE THIS FIRST STEP 
TO TAKE PLACE IN THE COMING MONTHS.

3.  NEXT, THE PRESIDENT, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, AND CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT 
CHIEFS MUST CERTIFY THAT THE CHANGE CAN BE MADE IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH 
THE STANDARDS OF MILITARY READINESS, MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS, UNIT COHESION, 
AND RECRUITING AND RETENTION OF THE ARMED FORCES.

4.  FINALLY, A 60-DAY PERIOD WILL FOLLOW CERTIFICATION BEFORE THE REPEAL OF 
DADT TAKES EFFECT.  UNTIL 60 DAYS HAVE PASSED AFTER CERTIFICATION, SECTION 654 
OF TITLE 10, AND ITS RELATED IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS REMAIN IN EFFECT.  
INDIVIDUALS WHO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS HOMOSEXUAL OR BISEXUAL REMAIN BARRED 
FROM ENLISTING OR RECEIVING A COMMISSION, AND SERVICE MEMBERS WHO ENGAGE IN 
HOMOSEXUAL ACTS, MAKE A STATEMENT THAT THEY ARE HOMOSEXUAL OR BISEXUAL (OR 
WORDS TO THAT EFFECT), OR MARRY OR ATTEMPT TO MARRY A PERSON KNOWN TO BE OF 
THE SAME BIOLOGICAL SEX, ARE SUBJECT TO ADMINISTRATIVE DISCHARGE.
IT REMAINS THE POLICY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE NOT TO ASK SERVICE MEMBERS 
OR APPLICANTS ABOUT THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION, TO TREAT ALL MEMBERS WITH 
DIGNITY AND RESPECT, AND TO ENSURE MAINTENANCE OF GOOD ORDER AND DISCIPLINE.

5.  OUR NAVY HAS EXCELLENT LEADERS, OFFICER AND ENLISTED, AT ALL LEVELS.  THAT 
LEADERSHIP WILL BE KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION, AND LEADERSHIP WILL 
CONTINUE TO KEEP ALL INFORMED.  AS WE MOVE FORWARD, WE WILL REMAIN THE MOST 
READY, CAPABLE, AND PROFESSIONAL NAVY IN THE WORLD, WHERE ALL ARE TREATED WITH 
DIGNITY AND RESPECT.

6.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.// BT
