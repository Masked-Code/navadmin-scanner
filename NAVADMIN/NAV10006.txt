SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS POLICY CHANGE.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES A STATUS UPDATE OF THE FY-10 SELECTIVE 
REENLISTMENT BONUS (SRB) PROGRAM AND A REMINDER FOR COMMANDS TO 
ACTIVELY ENGAGE THEIR SAILORS ON THE INCENTIVES PRESENTED THROUGH THE 
SRB PROGRAM.  SRB OPPORTUNITIES AND REQUIREMENTS HAVE CHANGED.  COMMAND 
LEADERS SHOULD REFAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH REFS A THROUGH C IN ORDER 
TO PROPERLY ADVISE ELIGIBLE PERSONNEL.

2.  OVER 1,300 SAILORS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SRB THIS FISCAL YEAR.  
WHILE THE SRB PROGRAM CONTINUES TO BE THE NAVY'S PRIMARY MONETARY 
INCENTIVE TO ENCOURAGE SAILORS WITH CRITICAL SKILLS AND VALUABLE 
EXPERIENCE TO STAY NAVY, WE MUST ALSO REMAIN WITHIN CONGRESSIONALLY 
AUTHORIZED FUNDING LIMITS.  ADDITIONALLY, SRB IS USED AS A FORCE 
STABLIZATION TOOL TO HELP MINIMIZE OVER-EXECUTION OR UNDER-EXECUTION OF 
CRITICAL SKILL RETENTION GOALS.  THEREFORE, AS REENLISTMENT GOALS FOR 
PARTICULAR SKILLS ARE ACHIEVED, SRB AWARD LEVELS FOR THOSE SKILLS WILL 
BE REMOVED FROM THE PLAN, BUT NO EARLIER THAN 30 DAYS FOLLOWING THE 
RELEASE OF A NAVADMIN ANNOUNCING THE AWARD LEVELS.  SAILORS ARE 
ENCOURAGED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SRB AS SOON AS ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS 
HAVE BEEN MET IAW REFS A THROUGH C.

3.  COMMANDS MUST SUBMIT SRB REQUESTS VIA OPINS 35-120 DAYS IN ADVANCE 
OF THE SAILOR'S REQUESTED REENLISTMENT DATE.  REQUESTS SUBMITTED LESS 
THAN 35 DAYS PRIOR TO THE REENLISTMENT DATE WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL 
JUSTIFICATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

4.  SAILORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO WORK WITH THEIR COMMAND CAREER COUNSELORS, 
COMMAND MASTER CHIEFS, AND CHAIN OF COMMAND TO INITIATE THE 
REENLISTMENT PROCEDURES WELL IN ADVANCE OF THEIR EAOS.
