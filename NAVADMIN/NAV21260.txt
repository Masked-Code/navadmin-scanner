RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the guidance for the administration of the 
March 2022 (cycle 255) Navy-Wide Advancement Exam (NWAE) for advancement-in-
rate of Active Duty (AD) and Full-Time Support (FTS) Sailors to paygrades E-5 
and E-6 and the use of an alternative final multiple score (FMS) rank-order 
method, without an exam, for E-4 
advancement candidates. 
    a.  As a continued safety measure due to the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) 
outbreak, E-4 advancement candidates will not participate in an exam, but 
will be given the opportunity for advancement using an alternative FMS rank-
order method, without the inclusion of an exam score from a proctored 
exam.  E-5 and E-6 advancement candidates will be administered the NWAE 
utilizing testing windows vice single-day testing.  These expanded testing 
windows will allow for smaller groups of test takers to ensure adequate 
social distancing can be maintained between testers at testing facilities, 
while maintaining the high standards and continued culture of learning that 
drive our enlisted advancement system.  This is identical to the advancement 
policy used in the 2021 fall NWAE cycle, and is a change from reference (a). 
    b.  In addition to the requirements in this NAVADMIN and chapter 6 of 
reference (a), educational services officers (ESO) must follow the pre-exam 
preparation requirements in the exam verbatim, which can be found on the Navy 
Enlisted Advancement System (NEAS) website via MyNavy Portal (MNP) at  
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/command-
information.  Select Command Advancement Tools, then NEAS Website.

fully completed by this date. 
 
3.  Eligibility requirements are found in chapter 2 of reference (a).   
The following information is specific only to cycle 255: 
    a.  The terminal eligibility date used to compute time-in-rate 
(TIR) is 1 July 2022. 
    b.  The minimum TIR date must be on or before: 
        E-6 - 1 July 2019 
        E-5 - 1 July 2021 
        E-4 - 1 January 2022 
    c.  E-6 candidate TIR requirements for early promote (EP) 
Sailors can be waived by one year with the commanding officer 
(CO)/officer-in-charge (OIC) approval, in line with paragraph 214.e. 
of reference (a).  Cycle 255 EAW must be manually created for all E-6 EP TIR 
waiver authorized candidates. 
    d.  High-year tenure (HYT) date must be effective 1 July 2022 or 
later.  All HYT waivers must be approved prior to 1 March 2022 to be able to 
participate in cycle 255. 
    e.  Candidates in a rating requiring a security clearance must have a 
favorable investigation adjudication by the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudication Facility reflected properly in the Defense 
Information System for Security (DISS) prior to 1 March 2022.  If the CO/OIC 
of the candidate grants an interim clearance, it must be entered in DISS 
prior to 1 March 2022.  Candidates must maintain security clearance 
eligibility throughout the advancement cycle to be eligible for 
advancement.  If, for any reason, a clearance is denied, revoked, or not 
reflected in DISS, an exam is not authorized and commands will not allow 
candidates to take the exam until the discrepancy is corrected or a new 
clearance is granted and is properly reflected in the EAW of the candidate. 
Ratings requiring a security clearance are:  AC, AE, AG, AO, ATI, 
ATO, AWF, AWO, AWR, AWS, AWV, AZ, CTI, CTM, CTN, CTR, CTT, EOD, ET, 
FC, FCA, GM, HT, IC, IS, IT, LN, MA, MC, MN, ND, OS, QM, SB, SO, 
STG, YN and all nuclear and submarine ratings.  Refer to references 
(a) and (b) for additional guidance. 
    f.  Candidates for advancement to E-4 and E-5 must compute performance 
mark average (PMA) using all applicable evaluations in the current paygrade 
of the candidate with an ending date that falls within the following time 
periods: 
        E-4 - 1 June 2021 to 28 February 2022 
        E-5 - 1 December 2020 to 28 February 2022 
    g.  Candidates for advancement to E-6 must compute the reporting senior 
cumulative average (RSCA) PMA, as outlined in reference (c), using all 
applicable evaluations in the current paygrade of the candidate with the 
ending date that falls within the time period: 
        E-6 - 1 March 2019 to 28 February 2022. 
    h.  Refer to reference (c) and paragraph 308.b. of reference (a) for 
additional guidance on RSCA PMA and PMA, including guidance on establishing 
PMA for new accessions who have graduated from A-school and do not have a 
current evaluation. 
    i.  PMK-EE is mandatory for cycle 255 candidates competing for 
advancement, even if no NWAE is being administered, and must be successfully 
completed once for the administration paygrade.  The PMK-EE completion 
deadline is 31 January 2022, in accordance with reference (d).  No Sailor 
competing for advancement shall be permitted to participate in the 
advancement cycle without having a completed PMK-EE for the administration 
paygrade. 
    j.  For guidance on establishing EAW user roles and completing 
worksheets, refer to reference (e).  EAW is mandatory for cycle 255 and will 
be the authority for PMA, RSCA PMA, and awards. 
    k.  Commands must accurately validate, complete and finalize all EAWs in 
the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System in a timely manner.  E-4 EAW 
accuracy is critical since NEAS will be reprogrammed to use finalized E-4 
EAWs rather than the candidate exam answer sheets to create E-4 candidate 
records.  The success of this process will be dependent upon the accurate 
completion of E-4 EAWs to establish advancement cycle participation.  Cycle 
255 E-4 EAWs must be completed by 31 March 2022.
