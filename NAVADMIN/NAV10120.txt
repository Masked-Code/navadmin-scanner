NARR/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1750.1F, NAVY FAMILY OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM//

RMKS/1.  THIS FAMILYGRAM NAVADMIN IS THE SECOND IN A SERIES DESIGNED TO 
PROVIDE INFORMATION ON SUPPORT SERVICES, ASSISTANCE AND ENTITLEMENTS AVAILABLE 
TO NAVY FAMILIES.  THIS MONTH?S TOPIC ADDRESSES RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR 
FAMILIES OF DEPLOYED SAILORS.

2.  AS AN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE, DEPLOYMENTS ARE PART OF THE NAVY LEGACY.
  OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS (OCO) HAVE CHANGED THE TRADITIONAL 
DEPLOYMENT MODEL AS SAILORS ARE NOW ALSO ASSIGNED AS INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEES.
WITH THESE CHANGES, NEW FAMILY SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS HAVE EMERGED.  NAVY FAMILY 
PREPAREDNESS PROGRAMS, POLICIES AND SERVICES CONTINUE TO EVOLVE TO MEET THE 
CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

3.  THE NAVY FAMILY SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT NAVY 
FAMILIES ARE PROACTIVELY PREPARED FOR MOBILIZATIONS, DEPLOYMENTS, AND 
PROLONGED SEPARATIONS THROUGH A NETWORK OF SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND COMMUNICATION 
CHANNELS THAT LINK THE COMMAND, FAMILY AND SAILOR, RESULTING IN A RESILIENT, 
WELL-INFORMED FAMILY.  A PREPARED NAVY FAMILY IS ADAPTABLE TO THE NAVY 
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND CAPABLE OF NAVIGATING THROUGH, AND UTILIZING, THE 
MANY SUPPORT SERVICES AVAILABLE.  TRADITIONAL FAMILY SUPPORT MECHANISMS ARE 
COMMAND-BASED.  THEY INCLUDE:
    A.  THE COMMAND OMBUDSMAN.  THE FIRST LINE OF SUPPORT FOR NAVY FAMILIES IS 
THE COMMAND OMBUDSMAN.  PER REF A, OMBUDSMEN ARE APPOINTED BY, AND WORK UNDER 
THE GUIDANCE OF, THE COMMANDING OFFICER.  THEY DISSEMINATE INFORMATION BOTH 
UP-AND-DOWN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND, INCLUDING OFFICIAL DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY 
AND COMMAND INFORMATION, COMMAND CLIMATE ISSUES, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) 
IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY.  THEY 
ALSO PROVIDE RESOURCE REFERRALS WHEN REQUESTED.  OMBUDSMEN?ARE INSTRUMENTAL I 
N RESOLVING FAMILY ISSUES BEFORE THE ISSUES REQUIRE COMMAND ATTENTION.
EVERY SAILOR AND SPOUSE SHOULD KNOW THEIR OMBUDSMAN AND SHOULD CONTACT 
HIM/HER.
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTACT YOUR OMBUDSMAN GO TO 
HTTP://WWW.OMBUDSMANREGISTRY.ORG.
    B.  COMMAND LEADERSHIP.  THE CO/XO/CMC ARE TASKED WITH PROVIDING NECESSARY 
SUPPORT TO THEIR SAILORS AND FAMILIES.  COMMAND LEADERSHIP DETERMINES THE 
SCOPE OF COMMAND FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND COMMUNICATES WITH FAMILIES 
THROUGH VARIOUS CHANNELS THAT MAY INCLUDE THE COMMAND CARELINE, COMMAND 
NEWSLETTERS AND SOCIAL
MEDIA.   COMMAND LEADERSHIP ALSO PREPARES FAMILIES FOR DEPLOYMENTS BY HOSTING
PRE-DEPLOYMENT BRIEFS.
    C.  FAMILY READINESS GROUP (FRG).  THE FRG IS A COMMAND-SPONSORED 
ORGANIZATION THAT IS PART OF A NETWORK OF KEY SUPPORT SERVICES (SUCH AS 
OMBUDSMEN, FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS (FFSC), CHAPLAINS, SCHOOL LIAISON 
OFFICERS, AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT CENTERS) THAT PROVIDE COORDINATED SERVICES IN 
SUPPORT OF SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES.  THE FRG PLANS, COORDINATES, 
AND CONDUCTS SOCIAL, INFORMATIONAL, CARE-TAKING, AND MORALE-BUILDING 
ACTIVITIES TO ENHANCE FAMILY PREPAREDNESS.  A NEW FRG INSTRUCTION AND 
DESKGUIDE ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND RESOURCES THAT ASSIST 
THE FRG IN THEIR ROLE OF SUPPORTING OUR FAMILIES.  THIS DESKGUIDE AND 
INSTRUCTION ARE EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE IN JULY 2010.
    D.  FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS (FFSC).  AS THEIR NAME IMPLIES, THE 
CHARTER OF THE FFSC IS TO SUPPORT THE SAILOR AND FAMILY WITH A HOST OF SUPPORT 
PROGRAMS.  THE FFSC HAS DEPLOYMENT SUPPORT PROGRAMS DIRECTED AT TRADITIONAL 
AND NON-TRADITIONAL DEPLOYMENTS, INCLUDING PROGRAMS FOR INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEES 
AND THEIR FAMILIES.  FFSCS PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES 
BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER DEPLOYMENT.
    E.  CHAPLAIN SERVICES.  NAVY CHAPLAINS, IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING RELIGIOUS 
MINISTRY, ARE VALUED MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY SUPPORT TEAM WORKING IN CONCERT 
WITH THE COMMAND, OMBUDSMAN, FAMILY READINESS GROUP AND FLEET AND FAMILY 
SUPPORT CENTERS.  CHAPLAINS PROVIDE CONFIDENTIAL CARE AND ARE AN EXCELLENT 
SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR RESOURCES AND REFERRALS.

4.  AS THE TRADITIONAL DEPLOYMENT MODEL CHANGED, ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WERE 
DEVELOPED.  THESE RESOURCES INCLUDE:
    A.  COMMAND INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE COORDINATOR (CIAC).  A NEW POSITION 
ESTABLISHED AT EACH COMMAND, THE CIAC IS A KEY ELEMENT OF SAILOR AND FAMILY 
SUPPORT.  THEIR CHARTER IS TO ACT AS A MENTOR, AN ADVOCATE, AND A PROFESSIONAL 
SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES.  
ALL NAVY COMMANDS WITH SAILORS DEPARTING ON IA ASSIGNMENTS, CURRENTLY ON AN IA 
ASSIGNMENT, OR HAVING RETURNED FROM AN IA ASSIGNMENT WITHIN THE PAST NINE 
MONTHS MUST HAVE A CIAC DESIGNATED IN WRITING BY THE CO OR OIC.  CIACS HAVE 
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE FAMILY OF DEPLOYED SAILORS AT 
REGULAR INTERVALS.
    B.  NEWLY DEVELOPED IA SPECIFIC INFORMATIONAL SUPPORT.  THE NAVY 
INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE WEBSITE, HTTP://WWW.IA.NAVY.MIL, CONTAINS A WEALTH OF 
INFORMATION FOR FAMILIES OF IA SAILORS, SUCH AS THE IA FAMILY HANDBOOK, WHICH 
IS A COMPREHENSIVE FAMILY GUIDE TO THE ENTIRE INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION 
MOBILIZATION PROCESS.  THE HANDBOOK PROVIDES PRACTICAL INFORMATION CONCERNING 
SUPPORT SERVICES, FINANCES, AND FAMILY COPING SUGGESTIONS WHILE THE SERVICE 
MEMBER IS DEPLOYED.

5.  FAMILY FINANCIAL PREPAREDNESS.  ANOTHER ASPECT OF FAMILY READINESS AND 
DEPLOYMENT PREPAREDNESS IS HAVING A PLAN TO ADDRESS FINANCIAL CONCERNS DURING 
DEPLOYMENT.
    A.  AN UPDATED WILL IS IMPERATIVE TO ENSURE FAMILY FINANCIAL WELL-BEING.  
IT IS VITAL THAT SAILORS HAVE A WILL AND REVIEW IT ANNUALLY FOR ANY REQUIRED 
CHANGES.
    B.  POWERS OF ATTORNEY ENSURE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE EMPOWERED TO ACT ON 
BEHALF OF THE MEMBER IN ORDER TO FILE TAXES OR MANAGE OTHER FINANCIAL MATTERS.  
THE BASE NAVY LEGAL SERVICES OFFICE CAN PROVIDE ASSISTANCE.
