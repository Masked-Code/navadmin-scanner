RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces updates to Sea Shore Flow (SSF) Enlisted 
Career Paths, the personnel policy that assigns sea and shore-duty tour 
lengths for each enlisted rating, as established in reference (a) and revised 
in reference (b).  Reference (c), as modified by reference (d), remains the 
governing SSF policy for nuclear-trained enlisted personnel.  Reference (e) 
remains the Sea Shore Rotation (SSR) policy for Full Time Support (FTS) 
Sailors.

2.  SSF ensures the Navy has enough Sailors on sea-duty to man all the sea- 
duty billets for each rating.  The SSF tour length policy requires periodic 
updates as the number of sea-duty and shore-duty billets changes.  These 
changes result in some ratings having longer sea-duty tour lengths while 
others will have shorter sea-duty tour lengths.
    a.  Simultaneous to this SSF update, MyNavy HR continues delivering 
Sailor 2025 and transforming our personnel system and processes to achieve 
greater flexibility and transparency.  We are transitioning from the long- 
standing assignment rotation-centric view of SSF to a more flexible, agile 
career-centric approach.  This approach represents the wide range of 
incentives and personnel options under Sailor 2025 for eventual integration 
into the planned Detailing Marketplace, giving our Sailors the flexibility, 
choice, and transparency they need for effective career management.
    b.  Summary of changes (full listing in paragraph 3):
        - 42 ratings have no changes to current tour lengths;
        - 20 ratings have increased time on sea duty;
        - 22 ratings have decreased time on sea duty;
        - 7 ratings have increased time on shore duty;
        - 2 ratings (MA and RP) convert from inside/outside United States 
rotation to SSR;
        - 1 rating (CTR) converts from not following SSF to following SSF;
        - T+X ratings, ratings that set a Sailors Prescribed Sea Tour (PST) 
and Projected Rotation Date (PRD) to align with Expiration of Active 
Obligated Service (EAOS), are adjusted based on projected initial time to 
train;
        - Change to notes for CT, MA and T+X ratings

3.  The tables below show the net change to current tour lengths for Sailors 
in ratings impacted by this NAVADMIN.  MyNavy Portal (MNP) contains the 
actual tour lengths and notes for all ratings (see paragraph 5 for more 
details).

4.  Commander, Navy Personnel Command (NPC) may adjust PRDs to reflect the 
tour lengths based on length of tour remaining and the needs of the Navy.
    a.  To support proper Fleet manning, reference (f) authorizes detailers 
to rotate Sailors 6 months prior to or after assigned PRD.  When detailing 
paygrades E7-E9, reference (g) delineates that SSF and SSR will be considered 
but will be secondary to Fleet manning requirements.
    b.  To minimize challenges in personnel planning, Sailors who have 
current PRDs within 12 months of the release of this NAVADMIN will not have 
their PRDs adjusted, unless requested by the Sailor via Enlisted Personnel 
Action Request (NAVPERS 1306/7) or the units commanding officer based on unit 
readiness needs.
    c.  Sailors with current PRDs beyond 12 months and whose new adjusted PRD 
places them inside the normal 7 to 12-month detailing window, will be handled 
on a case-by-case basis.  Actual rotation dates may vary by up to 6 months 
based on projected manning levels and availability of Sailors rotating to 
fill projected vacant billets, see reference (f) for more details.

5.  MNP provides specific tour lengths for each rating as well as additional 
information for various rating categories.  Sailors and commands can access 
SSF information on the MNP Career Planning page at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning/overview.  Select *I Agree* to 
the terms when logging in.  On the *Career Planning* overview page, scroll 
down to the *Looking For?* section, select *continue* under *Enlisted

Management page on the NPC website.  Lastly, on the left panel under 
Community Mangers, select *Sea Shore Flow*.

6.  Points of Contact:
