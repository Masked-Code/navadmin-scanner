Officer of the Navy (MCPON) Delbert D. Black Leadership Award.

2.  During his 30 years of distinguished service to the Navy, MCPON Delbert

advocacy.  His unselfish ability to lead Chief Petty Officers, unwavering 
loyalty to the Navy, and commitment to developing junior officers and Sailors 
set a positive tone for the Navy.  This award is presented to recognize a 
first-tour Command Master Chief, Chief of the Boat, or Command Senior Chief

MCPON Delbert D. Black.

Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-U.S. Naval Forces Africa, Chief of Naval 
Personnel, and the Chief of Naval Operations Command Master Chief (for all 
direct-report Echelon 2 commands) will each nominate one candidate from their 
area of responsibility.  The Office of the MCPON will consolidate nominations 
and select the winner.  Final nomination packages are due to the Office of 
the MCPON no later than Friday,
