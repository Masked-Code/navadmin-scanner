RMKS/1. REF A ANNOUNCED THE ADMIRAL STAN ARTHUR AWARDS FOR LOGISTICS 
EXCELLENCE PROGRAM FOR CY-2006.  THIS AWARD RECOGNIZES MILITARY AND 
CIVILIAN LOGISTICIANS WHO EPITOMIZE EXCELLENCE IN LOGISTICS PLANNING 
AND EXECUTION.  A FLAG/SES PANEL REVIEWED CANDIDATES AND SELECTED 
WINNERS BASED ON INNOVATIONS THAT MERIT SPECIAL RECOGNITION.  I AM 
PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THE FOLLOWING CY-2006 WINNERS:
    A.  THE CY-2006 MILITARY LOGISTICIAN OF THE YEAR IS LCDR DANIEL L. 
NORTON, SC, USN, FROM FLEET INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY CENTER, SIGONELLA, ITALY.  
LCDR NORTON S EXCEPTIONAL FORESIGHT AND SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WERE 
INSTRUMENTAL IN THE MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION OF THE INTERMODAL 
TRANSFER OF 120 ARMY HELICOPTERS, 1350 TONS OF CARGO, AND 300 PERSONNEL.  
HE FLAWLESSLY DIRECTED THE EFFORTS OF THE SURFACE DEPLOYMENT 
DISTRIBUTION COMMAND, 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION, 82ND AIRBORNE DIVISION, 
5TH BATTALION OF THE 502ND INFANTRY, MILITARY SEALIFT COMMAND, 725TH 
AIR MOBILITY SQUADRON, NAVAL FACILITIES ROTA, AND VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF 
NAVAL STATION ROTA.  HE REALIZED SAVINGS UPWARDS OF $10 MILLION PER 
DEPLOYMENT.  
    B.  THE CY-2006 CIVILIAN LOGISTICIAN OF THE YEAR IS MRS. BEVERLY 
THOMAS, TRAFFIC MANAGER, AT THE NAVAL INVENTORY CONTROL POINT (NAVICP) 
PHILADELPHIA, PA.  MRS. THOMAS STREAMLINED PROCESSES USED TO MANAGE THE 
INVENTORY OF CRITICAL REPARABLE COMPONENTS THROUGHOUT THE 
TRANSPORTATION PIPELINE.  THE CORNERSTONE OF MRS. THOMAS  STRATEGY IS 
THE ELECTRONIC RETROGRADE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.  THIS WEB-BASED TOOL 
ENABLED DEPLOYED OPERATIONS AT REMOTE LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD TO 
EXPEDITIOUSLY PREPARE RETROGRADE FOR SHIPMENT.  THE TOOL HAS PROVIDED 
FLEXIBILITY TO RAPIDLY MEET MULTIPLE REQUIREMENTS AND CAPABILITY TO 
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE FLEET WORKLOAD.  WITH INITIAL ROLLOUT ONBOARD THE 
USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN, THE SYSTEM IS NOW USED TO PROCESS 85 PERCENT OF 
ALL NAVAL RETROGRADE, AND ACHIEVED A COST SAVINGS OF $10.6 MILLION.  
OTHER IMPRESSIVE RESULTS INCLUDED A 30 PERCENT REDUCTION IN AVERAGE 
TRANSIT TIMES, A 99 PERCENT PROOF OF DELIVERY RATE, AND IMPROVED 
LOGISTICS SUPPORT AND WORKLOAD REDUCTION FOR THE WARFIGHTER.
    C.  THE CY-2006 LOGISTICS TEAM OF THE YEAR IS THE COMNAVCENT 
N4/COMBINED TASK FORCE FIVE NINE (CTF-59) NONCOMBATANT EVACUATION 
OPERATION LEBANON LOGISTICS TEAM.  THE TEAM SUPPORTED THE PLANNING AND 
EXECUTION OF THE SWIFT EVACUATION OF APPROXIMATELY 15,000 AMERICAN 
CITIZENS FROM LEBANON AFTER HOSTILITIES ERUPTED BETWEEN ISRAEL AND 
LEBANESE HEZBOLLAH IN JULY 2006.  THE TEAM S EFFORTS INCLUDED A RAPID 
BUILD-UP AND DEPLOYMENT OF 9 SHIPS, 40 AIRCRAFT, MORE THAN 900 U.S. 
JOINT FORCES ASHORE ON CYPRUS, AND 6,000 SAILORS AND MARINES AT SEA IN 
THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN.  WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR
HOURS, MEMBERS OF THE TEAM STOOD UP A FORWARD LOGISTICS SUPPORT SITE, 
WHERE THEY ESTABLISHED ON-THE-GROUND CONTINGENCY CONTRACTING PROCEDURES 
AND PREPARED THE FOUNDATION FOR THE FOLLOW-ON MOVEMENT OF SUSTAINMENT 
PACKAGES.  IN ADDITION, THEY DEVELOPED AND POPULATED A WEBSITE ALLOWING 
STAKEHOLDER ACCESS TO TIMELY AND ACCURATE TRANSPORTATION AND MOVEMENT 
INFORMATION.  PROVIDING ROUND-THE-CLOCK VISIBILITY OF CRITICAL 
LOGISTICS DATA ELEMENTS ENABLED THE STAFF TO FOCUS ON ESSENTIAL NEO 
LOGISTICS EXECUTION AND PLANNING.  THE TEAM ALSO SOURCED A SIGNIFICANT 
PORTION OF THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND TRANSPORTATION REQUIREMENTS 
WITH THE COALITION FORCES LAND COMPONENT COMMAND (CFLCC) C4.  THIS 
JOINT SOLUTION DROVE THE EXPEDITIOUS, IN-THEATER RELEASE OF 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE ITEMS AND HEALTH AND COMFORT ITEMS TO THE 
EVACUEES WITHIN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS OF NOTIFICATION.   
2.  AWARD LEVELS FOR CY-2006 ARE $5,000 EACH FOR THE MILITARY AND THE 
CIVILIAN LOGISTICIAN OF THE YEAR AND $10,000 FOR THE TEAM AWARD.  THE 
TEAM AWARD WILL BE ISSUED TO THE PARENT COMMAND FOR DISTRIBUTION AMONG 
TEAM MEMBERS.
3.  MY HEARTIEST CONGRATULATIONS AND BZ TO THE WINNERS.  THIS AWARD 
RECOGNIZES YOUR SUPERLATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS THAT HAVE RESULTED IN 
SUBSTANTIAL AND QUANTIFIABLE BENEFITS TO THE NAVY AND HAVE ENHANCED THE 
LOGISTICS PROFESSION.
