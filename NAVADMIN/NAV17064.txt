RMKS/1. This message convenes and provides administrative updates for the 
execution of the Naval Research Working Group (NRWG) 17 meeting, 17-21 Apr 
2017 at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), Monterey, CA.

2. Per Ref A, the NRWG meeting will convene aboard NPS in order to address 
current and future naval research requirements, integrate NPS faculty into 
the total naval R&D capability, and disseminate the knowledge gained from 
these research projects to stakeholders.

3. NRWG meeting participants include NPS students, faculty, staff, and 
individuals from Navy and Marine Corps agencies who have research or analysis 
needs. These agencies are termed topic sponsors.

4. NRWG 17 will be a different format than previous NRWGs.  Each topic 
sponsor will be assigned a tradeshow booth in the NPS McNitt Ballroom where 
they will be able to discuss research opportunities with NPS faculty and 
students.  There will no longer be a plenary session or revolving panel 
sessions where topic sponsors present research topics.  Topic sponsors should 
enter research topics in the topic portal on the NPS Naval Research Program 
(NRP) website no later than 27 Mar 2017 in order to be included in the NRWG 
program. The topic portal is located at 
https:(slash)(slash)my.nps.edu/nrp/topic-portal. For those without an NPS 
login, a CAC card is required to log in.  Additionally, each attending topic 
sponsor POC may coordinate In-Progress Reviews (IPRs) during NRWG 17 with 
faculty and students currently conducting sponsored research projects.
