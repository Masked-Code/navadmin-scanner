SUBJ/STATIONARY CYCLE AND ELLIPTICAL TRAINER TESTING PROCEDURES// 
REF/A/MSG/CNO/202045ZOCT06// AMPN/REF A IS NAVADMIN 293/06 ANNOUNCING 
THE ELLIPTICAL TRAINER AS A CARDIO OPTION.// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS 
NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE STATIONARY CYCLE AS AN ADDITIONAL PRT CARDIO 
OPTION ALONG WITH THE ELLIPTICAL TRAINING ANNOUNCED BY REF A.
2.  THE ONLY AUTHORIZED STATIONARY CYCLE FOR THE PRT IS THE LIFE 
FITNESS (MODEL 95 CI).  THE ONLY AUTHORIZED ELLIPTICAL TRAINERS FOR THE 
PRT ARE THE LIFE FITNESS (MODELS CT 9500 HR, CT 9500, 95 XI (QUIET 
DRIVE VERSION ONLY), 91 XI, AND 91 X), THE PRECOR (MODEL EFX-NAVY), AND 
THE NAUTILUS (MODEL E9 16).
3.  PERSONNEL WHO INTEND TO USE THE CYCLE OR ELLIPTICAL FOR THE PRT ARE 
HIGHLY ENCOURAGED TO TRAIN AND FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES ON THE AUTHORIZED 
VERSION(S) OF THE MACHINES TO ENSURE THEY ARE MEETING THEIR GOALS.
4.  THE CYCLE AND ELLIPTICAL TESTS ARE BOTH A 12-MINUTE FIXED-TIMED 
TEST THAT PERMITS A DIRECT CORRELATION OF THE CYCLE AND ELLIPTICAL TEST 
RESULTS TO THE 1.5 MILE RUN (WHICH REMAINS THE  STANDARD PHYSICAL 
READINESS TEST).  THE GOAL IS TO BURN AS MANY CALORIES AS POSSIBLE.
5.  THE CFL SHALL CONDUCT THE CYCLE AND ELLIPTICAL TESTS AS FOLLOWS:
    A.  OBTAIN AUTHORIZATION FOR THE CYCLE AND/OR ELLIPTICAL TEST FROM 
THE COMMANDING OFFICER/OFFICER-IN-CHARGE.
    B.  PRACTICE SAFETY, SETUP/START/STOP AND TESTING PROCEDURES ON 
EACH INDIVIDUAL MACHINE PRIOR TO CONDUCTING ANY OFFICIAL TESTING.
    C.  PERFORM OFFICIAL BODY COMPOSITION ASSESSMENT (BCA) WITHIN THE 
REQUIRED WINDOW OF 24 HOURS (MINIMUM) TO 30 HOURS (MAXIMUM) PRIOR TO 
THE PRT.
    D.  VERIFY THAT SAFETY, SETUP/START/STOP, AND TESTING PROCEDURES 
WORK ACCURATELY ON EACH INDIVIDUAL MACHINE PRIOR TO USE ON TESTING DAY.
    E.  VERIFY THE CLOCK ACCURATELY MEASURES TIME ON EACH INDIVIDUAL 
MACHINE TO BE USED FOR TESTING PRIOR TO USE ON TESTING DAY.
    F.  ENSURE SAILORS UNDERSTAND THAT OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY 
REQUIRE PROPER HYDRATION.
    G.  ENSURE THE PARTICIPANT HAS PRACTICED ON THE SPECIFIC MACHINE 
USED FOR THE TEST AND IS FAMILIAR WITH ALL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
    H.  BEGIN 12-MINUTE TEST UTILIZING THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE.
        (1) ENSURE MACHINE DATA IS CLEARED PRIOR TO PROGRAMMING FOR THE 
TEST.
        (2) INSTRUCT MEMBER TO STEP ON MACHINE.
        (3) PROGRAM THE FOLLOWING FOUR ITEMS IN THE ORDER REQUIRED BY 
THE SPECIFIC MACHINE:
            (A)  MANUAL  PROGRAM
            (B) RESISTANCE OF SAILOR S CHOICE
            (C) OFFICIAL BCA WEIGHT (FOR ELLIPTICAL ONLY)
            (D)  BIKE  MODE (FOR CYCLE ONLY)
            (E)  12 MINUTES  (ADJUST AS REQUIRED FOR MACHINES THAT 
UTILIZE AUTOMATIC COOL DOWN, FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE MACHINE GOES INTO 
AUTOMATIC COOL DOWN 2 MINUTES BEFORE THE TIME THAT IT IS SET, SET THE 
MACHINE FOR 14 MINUTES SO IT DOES NOT START AUTOMATIC COOL DOWN UNTIL 
THE SAILOR HAS TESTED FOR 12 MINUTES)
        (4) CONDUCT TEST OF 12 MINUTES, ALLOWING THE SAILOR TO VARY THE 
RESISTANCE/LOAD AND STRIDE RATE/PEDAL RATE TO MAXIMIZE PERFORMANCE 
WHILE OTHERWISE KEEPING HANDS ON THE MOVEABLE HANDLEBARS THROUGHOUT THE 
TEST.
        (5) AT THE 12 MINUTE MARK, READ, ANNOUNCE AND RECORD CALORIC 
OUTPUT FROM CYCLE OR ELLIPTICAL DISPLAY SCREEN.
    I.  STOP CYCLE OR ELLIPTICAL AND INSTRUCT THE SAILOR WHEN TO STEP 
OFF THE MACHINE.
    J.  INPUT CALORIC OUTPUT INTO THE PRIMS CALCULATOR TO BE CONVERTED 
INTO RUN TIME.
    K.  SCORE RUN TIME USING 1.5 MILE RUN PERFORMANCE CHARTS IN 
OPNAVINST 6110.1H.
6.  CYCLE AND ELLIPTICAL TEST EVENTS SHALL BE ENDED WHEN PARTICIPANT 
COMPLETES EXACTLY 12 MINUTES.  THE CYCLE AND ELLIPTICAL TEST EVENT IS 
FAILED WHEN PARTICIPANT TERMINATES EVENT PRIOR TO 12 MINUTES, SUCH
AS:
    A.  STOPPING TO REST.
    B.  STOPPING THE MACHINE.
    C.  STANDING UP ON CYCLE.
    D.  REMOVING HANDS FROM HANDLEBARS (OTHER THAN MOMENTARILY
REQUIRED FOR COMFORT, E.G., TO ADJUST THE RESISTANCE).   HANDLEBARS
FOR THE ELLIPTICAL ARE DEFINED AS THE PRIMARY SET OF MOVABLE HANDLES, 
NOT THE SECONDARY SET ON SOME MACHINES THAT DO NOT MOVE WHILE 
EXERCISING.
7.  CFLS SHALL NOT ALLOW SAILORS TO TEST ON INDIVIDUAL MACHINES ON 
WHICH THEY HAVE NOT PRACTICED SAFETY, SETUP/START/STOP, OR TESTING 
PROCEDURES PRIOR TO THE TESTING DAY.  CFLS SHALL NOT TEST SAILORS ON 
INDIVIDUAL MACHINES THEY HAVE NOT VERIFIED ARE WORKING PROPERLY.
CFLS/ACFLS SHALL BE PRESENT TO PERSONALLY READ, ANNOUNCE, AND RECORD 
THE CALORIC OUTPUT AT THE 12 MINUTE MARK.  ALL FOUR PRT COMPONENTS 
(SIT/REACH, CURLUPS, PUSHUPS, AND CYCLE OR ELLIPTICAL) SHALL BE 
PERFORMED IAW OPNAVINST 6110.1H WITH ONE EXCEPTION BEING THE TIME THE 
BCA IS PERFORMED.
8.  PERSONNEL SHOULD BE ADVISED THE CYCLE AND ELLIPTICAL CARDIO OPTIONS 
ARE CHALLENGING EVENTS AND SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED WITHOUT PRIOR 
TRAINING TO ENSURE SAFETY AND TO BE AWARE OF PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES.
9.  COMMANDING OFFICERS HAVE DISCRETION IN AUTHORIZING THE CYCLE AND 
ELLIPTICAL AS PHYSICAL READINESS TESTING OPTIONS.  THE COMMANDING 
OFFICER SHOULD CONSIDER THE ADDITIONAL TIME CONSTRAINTS REQUIRED BY THE 
CFL TO ADMINISTER THE PRT USING THESE OPTIONS AS WELL AS AUTHORIZED 
EQUIPMENT AVAILABILITY.
10.  THE 1.5 MILE RUN REMAINS THE NAVY TESTING STANDARD.  SAILORS 
MEDICALLY WAIVED FROM THE 1.5 MILE RUN CANNOT BE REQUIRED TO TEST USING 
THE CYCLE, ELLIPTICAL, SWIM OR TREADMILL OPTIONS.  SAILORS CHOOSING TO 
TEST USING ONE OF THESE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS SHALL ENSURE THE MEDICAL 
WAIVER SPECIFICALLY STATES WHICH CARDIO OPTIONS HAVE BEEN CLEARED BY 
THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER.
11.  COMMENCING 1 JANUARY 2007, THE RUN TIME CONVERSION CALCULATOR WAS 
PROGRAMMED INTO PRIMS FOR OFFICIAL SCORING, WITH A CALCULATOR TO 
CONDUCT PRACTICE TESTING THAT DETERMINES PERFORMANCE AVAILABLE ON THE 
PHYSICAL READINESS PROGRAM OFFICE WEBSITE AT 
WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/COMMANDSUPPORT/PHYSICALREADINESS.  THE CALCULATORS 
WILL USE THE CALORIC OUTPUT, THE BRAND AND MODEL OF CYCLE OR ELLIPTICAL, 
THE OFFICIAL BCA WEIGHT, AND A MALE/FEMALE CORRECTION FACTOR TO 
CALCULATE THE EQUIVALENT RUN TIME.  THE RUN TIME WILL THEN BE SCORED 
USING THE RUN PERFORMANCE CHARTS (ACCOUNTING FOR ALTITUDE, AGE, AND 
GENDER) CONTAINED IN OPNAVINST 6110.1H.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE 
ELLIPTICAL TRAINERS, OR THE STATIONARY CYCLE, AND OTHER PRT CONCERNS,
