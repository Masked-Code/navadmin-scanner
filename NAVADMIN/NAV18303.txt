RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces convening of the February 2019 Active-Duty 
Officer Lateral Transfer and Redesignation Board.  The lateral transfer and 
redesignation process is a key tool by which the Navy manages the talents of 
its officers.  It provides flexibility in officer community manning and 
improves the Navy return on investment in officer training and education by 
leveraging the specialized skillsets of officers throughout their careers.  
As part of the process, applications from qualified unrestricted line, 
restricted line, staff corps and limited duty officers (LDO) are now being 
accepted for the Active-Duty Officer Lateral Transfer and Redesignation 
Board, which convenes on 25 February 2019.  Full-Time Support and Selected 
Reserve officers are not eligible to apply for this board.  All officers 
considering applying for lateral transfer or redesignation through this board 
are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with references (a) through 
(k).

2.  In addition to the year group (YG) limitations imposed in paragraph 6, 
applicants must also meet eligibility requirements detailed in references (a) 
through (c) and are required to review and comply with any additional 
community requirements found in the February 2019 letter of instruction 
located at:
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/administrative/TransferRedesignation/Pages/default.aspx.
    a.  Officers who do not meet eligibility requirements in line with 
references (a) through (c) such as time-in-grade, years-of- commissioned 
service (YCS) or time-in-service must submit a waiver request in addition to 
or in conjunction with their lateral transfer and redesignation application 
as defined by specific communities.
    b.  A waiver request must include the waiver request letter of the 
officer and the endorsement of the commanding officer (CO).  The CO may 
endorse the waiver in the same letter as the lateral transfer package 
endorsement.
    c.  Active Component LDOs in the supply corps (651X) and information 
warfare community (IWC) (68XX) are designated for off- ramp as listed in 
reference (j).  Those who desire to redesignate within their parent 
communities should submit their requests in line with reference (j) vice this 
board.

3.  Submit applications and waiver requests (as required), using the format 
in reference (b) via email to BUPERS- 3_LATXFR.fct(at)navy.mil.  Email 
subject line should reflect February 2019 Lateral Transfer Board.  If no 
means of electronic correspondence are available, hard copy application 
packages can be sent via U.S. Postal and Express Mail Services (to include 
FEDEX, UPS and DHL) to:

7.  Notes:
    a.  Must have surface warfare officer (SWO) qualification completed to 
apply for transfer.  Officers under revised Junior Critical Skills Retention 
Bonus, Lieutenant Commander Retention Bonus or Department Head Retention 
Bonus contract are not eligible for transfer until completion of bonus 
obligation.  SWOs serving under an agreement for any of the SWO bonuses are 
eligible to apply to the board if the board convening date is within one year 
of satisfaction of the full bonus obligation.  Quotas out may be limited due 
to manning levels for any given YG, community billet requirements, the status 
of department head contract goals for YGs with less than six years of 
commissioned service and the individual officers assignment status.  Officers 
within their detailing window must communicate with their detailer prior to 
submitting a lateral transfer application.  Executing orders, slating to a 
billet, serving in a hard fill billet or one with significant training 
required could disqualify an officer for consideration and release from the 
community until arrival to the next duty station or minimum activity tour is 
complete.  Requests for lateral transfer out of the SWO community from O-4 
and above will be considered on a case-by- case basis due to shortages in 
these grades.
    b.  Waivers to the requirements for nuclear-trained surface and submarine 
warfare officers in paragraph 4h of reference (b) may be considered on a 
case-by-case basis.
    c.  Officers commissioned under a still-valid SWO-option agreement 
(Engineering Duty, Intel, IP, CW and OCEANO) must contact their respective 
restricted line option community manager regarding desire to be released from 
the SWO-option agreement and seek lateral transfer to a different community.
    d.  Nuclear-trained surface warfare officers YG-13 and senior have a 
limited opportunity for lateral transfer consideration.
    e.  Officers screened not cleared for their next career milestone are 
eligible.
    f.  The YG range provided displays possible opportunities.
Contact your specific community placement officer with questions regarding 
quota availability for each Type/Model/Series/YG.  General aviation officers 
(1300) are eligible to apply for lateral transfer regardless of active duty 
service obligation (ADSO) from winging.
Aviation officers (131X and 132X) are eligible to apply for lateral transfer 
if the officer has fulfilled ADSO, or will be within 12 months of completing 
ADSO at the time the board convenes.  Aviation officers with obligated 
service as a result of aviation bonus (AvB) are eligible to apply if the 
officer will be within 12 months of completing AvB obligation at the time the 
board convenes.
Additionally, aviation officers with obligated service as a result of AvB are 
eligible to apply if the officer will be within 12 months of department head 
tour projected rotation date (PRD) at the time the board convenes, regardless 
of contrary AvB contract language.
Redesignation immediately following department head tour may result in 
cancellation of aviation incentive pay and AvB, which will be adjudicated by 
Aviation Officer Assignment Division (PERS-43).
Graduates from U.S. Naval Test Pilot School class 151 and 152 may apply for 
aerospace engineering duty officer (AEDO) only, regardless of ADSO (contact 
AEDO officer community manager (OCM) for details).
If selected, aviation officers should expect to redesignate immediately.  
Exceptions may be made for the completion of ADSO, 
fulfillment/expiration/cancellation of AvB contract or PRD, as determined by 
Aviation OCM (BUPERS-313).  Aviation officers in operational flying billets 
(billet designator XXX1 or XXX2) will not redesignate until vacating the 
billet.  BUPERS-313 authorizes redesignation timing.  By accepting a lateral 
transfer out of aviation (13XX), effective the date of redesignation with the 
lateral transfer application and COs endorsement fulfilling the requirements 
set forth in reference (h), an officer consents to voluntary termination of 
flight status (except for AEDO selects).
    g.  ED Community.
        (1) Applicants desiring out quota from ED:
            (a) ED out-quotas are extremely limited.  Redesignation requests 
must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis with careful consideration given to 
impact on overall community health.
            (b) Applicants must have fulfilled at least 24 months of their 
postgraduate education payback tour in order to apply.
        (2) Applicants desiring redesignation to ED:
            (a) Officers without a warfare qualification are expected to 
submit an application for the ED dolphin program in line with reference (i).
            (b) Applicants from YG 15-12 (para 6c) are desired.  YG
11-09 inventory requirements are met and not open for redesignation on this 
board.  Applicants for YG 08 are desired if applicants are currently enrolled 
in or have completed an approved masters degree.
See reference (j) for a list of approved degrees and corresponding 
subspecialty codes.
    h.  LDO redesignation requests will be reviewed on a case-by- case basis, 
considering impact to overall community health.  Nuclear LDO submissions will 
not be considered.  All other designators must have completed four years 
commissioned service and accepted permanent LDO appointment to lieutenant 
prior to lateral transfer/redesignation.  LDO out quotas are extremely 
limited but special consideration will be given to officers projected to be 
statutorily separated for years of service prior to attaining the rank of 
commander.
    i.  Officers YG 15 and senior seeking lateral transfer into the surface 
warfare community are strongly encouraged to contact the SWO community 
manager prior to applying in order to discuss critical SWO career milestone 
requirements.
    j.  Naval special warfare (NSW) will no longer consider or select lateral 
transfers via this board.  All applicants will be considered by a separate 
NSW selection process and must submit their application via current OCM to 
the sea, air, land (SEAL) OCM.  More information, including required 
application contents and submission due dates, can be found on the SEAL OCM 
website:
https://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/communitymanagers/active/Unrestricted/nsw/Pages/SEALO
fficerSelection.aspx.
    k.  Eligible officers in YG 16 and junior will be considered for lateral 
transfer and redesignation as an explosive ordnance disposal
(EOD) warfare officer trainee (1190).  Those interested are encouraged to 
contact the EOD OCM for package requirements and eligibility.
    l.  YG 12 and junior have highest anticipated inventory requirement.  
However, the human resource community is targeting increased inventory for 
operations analysis (OA) specialists.
Officers in all eligible YGs OA subspecialty (321X) from completed graduate 
education and/or experience and/or those with an academic profile code of 325 
or better are encouraged to apply.
    m.  Officers who are one time failure to select for lieutenant commander 
will not be considered for lateral transfer to 1510.
Aviation officers (13XX) are eligible and may apply for 1510 (only) 
regardless of ADSO if they are a graduate of U.S. Naval Test Pilot School 
class 151 or class 152.
    n.  Officers are strongly encouraged to contact the aerospace maintenance 
duty OCM to discuss milestones and qualifications commensurate with YG.
    o.  All applicants should be within 12 months of PRD, but shall be within
