NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 116/20, NAVY MITIGATION MEASURES IN RESPONSE TO 
CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK UPDATE 4.  
REF B IS MEMO FROM UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR PERSONNEL AND READINESS (USD 
PR), AUTHORIZED DEPARTURE-INDIVIDUALS AT HIGHER RISK FROM COVID-19.  
REF C IS MEMO FROM USD PR, AUTHORIZED DEPARTURE FOR INDIVIDUALS AT HIGHER 
RISK FROM COVID-19-TERMINATION OF DEPARTURE AUTHORITY.  
REF D IS THE JOINT TRAVEL REGULATIONS.//

RMKS/1.  Paragraph 3.F of reference (a) announced the authorized departure of 
dependents in line with reference (b).  This NAVADMIN announces the 
termination of that authorized departure in line with reference (c).

2.  In line with reference (c), Department of Defense eligible family members 
and civilian employees who did not have travel orders approved prior to 7 May 
2020, may no longer use the authority of reference (b) to depart their duty 
station.  For those currently at a safe haven authorized by reference (b), 
the Department of State has extended all current global authorized departures 
until 11 June 2020.  All authorized departure allowances are terminated 
effective 11 June 2020.  For those who had orders approved after 7 May 2020 
and have travelled to a safe haven, contact the Military Pay and Compensation 
Policy Branch (OPNAV N130) via e-mail at nxag_n130c(at)navy.mil for further 
guidance.

3.  In line with table 6-19 of reference (d), dependents departing a non-
foreign location OCONUS or foreign location will receive return 
transportation from the safe haven to the Service Members permanent duty 
station (PDS) if the days remaining on their tour of duty on the dependents 
scheduled arrival date is 60 or more days.  The secretarial process must be 
used for return travel to the PDS if the days remaining on the tour of duty 
on the dependents scheduled arrival date is 59 days or less. For those cases, 
submit requests to OPNAV N130 via e-mail at nxag_n130c(at)navy.mil.

4.  In line with section 060107-B-3 of reference (d), if return travel cannot 
be completed by the termination date of 11 June 2020, due to circumstances 
beyond the control of the traveler, a request for extension of safe haven 
allowances may be submitted to OPNAV N130 via email at 
nxag_n130c(at)navy.mil.

5.  Family members must work with their Service Member to contact their 
command as soon as possible to make return travel arrangements, regardless of 
when they plan to travel back.  International travel is difficult due to the 
limited travel options and starting the process early is important.  Delay in 
making return travel arrangements risks the inability to travel before 11 
June 2020, when safe haven allowances cease.

6.  Service Members should contact their command to determine if any 
restriction of movement, isolation or quarantine requirements are required by 
the host country upon return.

7.  Service Members with questions regarding this NAVADMIN should contact 
MyNavy Career Center (MNCC), available 24/7, by phone at
(833) 330-MNCC ((833) 330-6622) or via e-mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil.

8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.

9.  Released by Vice Admiral John B. Nowell, Jr, N1.//
