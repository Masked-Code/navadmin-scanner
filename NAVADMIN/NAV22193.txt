RMKS/1.  Per references (a) through (m), this message provides interim 
guidance to clarify requirements, and define life cycle responsibilities 
associated with Electronic Security Systems (ESS) on Navy installations. 
 
2.  Background.  Installation commanding officers have an inherent 
responsibility to provide protection for their installations.  This is 
accomplished through the employment of a defense in depth approach, to 
include the use of ESS.  A lack of policy encouraging standardization of ESS 
employment has resulted in inconsistent responsibilities and procurement 
practices; fostering a wide variety of requirements, installation and 
maintenance/sustainment practices.  Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, Fleet 
Readiness and Logistics (OPNAV N4) intends to streamline and standardize the 
procurement, installation, sustainment, and training for ESS across the shore 
domain.  Overall goals are to reduce waste in resourcing across the Service, 
improve existing and future system configurations and cyber fitness, and 
reduce the need for various exchanges to engage with vendors for procurement 
and sustainment of various systems. 
 
3.  Policy. 
    a.  Under the authority of OPNAV N4, and as a component of the Navy 
Physical Security Program, ESS is understood to include integrated (or stand-
alone) electronic systems that encompass interior and exterior intrusion 
detection systems, closed circuit television or video surveillance systems 
(for assessment of alarm conditions), access control systems, alarm reporting 
systems for monitoring, control, and/or display; duress devices, and other 
associated components such as data transmission media (DTM).  For the 
purposes of this policy, DTM refers only to communications and network 
components categorized as personal property per reference (h). 
    b.  ESS for designated restricted areas will be procured and deployed in 
accordance with references (b) through (m).  This includes security 
requirements associated with installation perimeter access control and 
restricted areas as defined by reference (b). 
    c.  ESS for restricted areas will be centrally monitored at a location 
from which law enforcement/security response can be dispatched.  Central 
(regional) and local monitoring stations will be manned by certified 
operators. 
    d.  All ESS employment will be executed by a single warfare center for 
execution of ESS projects in support of Navy requirements. 
    e.  Existing ESS on Navy installations that are not required by 
references (b) through (k), or validated by the Navy ESS Program, will be 
directed to the technical manager for ESS support. 
    f.  The Navy ESS technical manager will provide support to all Navy 
tenants, including Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command 
(COMNAVFACENGSYSCOM) for construction and special projects (i.e. military 
construction and facilities sustainment, and restoration and modernization 
funded projects).  This technical support will extend to Navy tenants on 
other Service installations, and off installation areas as deemed appropriate 
by Director, Installations (OPNAV N4I) and Commander, Navy Installations 
Command (CNIC).  This includes supporting non-Navy tenants on Navy 
installations as needed. 
    g.  Requests for exceptions shall use the waiver and exception process 
defined in reference (b). 
 
4.  Responsibilities. 
    a.  OPNAV N4I, will: 
        (1) Update reference (b) to ensure ESS requirements and definitions 
are clearly defined for designated restricted areas;

execution procurement and emergent needs. 
    b.  CNIC will: 
        (1) Act as the single Navy Program Office for ESS deemed valid by 
OPNAV N4I.  All Navy ESS Program funded systems will be owned by, and the 
responsibility of, the ESS Program; 
        (2) Serve as the single budget submitting organization (BSO) and 
System Owner for the Navy ESS Program; 
        (3) Update reference (d) to ensure ESS requirements are defined for

on all installations; 
        (5) Develop an education campaign for region and installation 
personnel on Navy ESS programmatic and business cycle guidance; 
        (6) Provide a report annually no later than the 4th quarter of each 
fiscal year that includes a status of the program and emergent and planned 
requirements for POM planning; 
        (7) As office of primary responsibility for Navy ESS Program, 
continue execution of other physical security equipment categorized as real 
property (automated vehicle barriers, waterside security defense systems, 
automated vehicle gates, automated pedestrian turnstiles) ensuring system 
integration with ESS where feasible; 
        (8) Ensure Navy ESS project management, execution and sustainment is 
supported by and incorporated within the approved information management 
system;

refreshment) for ESS; 
        (11) Ensure all installation and life cycle management of ESS adhere 
to the requirements set forth in references (e) and (k); 
        (12) Coordinate with Security Equipment Integration Working Group 
(SEIWG) and participate in reoccurring events, to foster physical security 
equipment interoperability ensuring compliance with SEIWG (SEIWG National 
Information Exchange Model (NIEM) Information Exchange Package Documentation) 
and NIEM standards, per DODI 8320.07; 
        (13) Establish and maintain a formal training program to support end 
user and technical support personnel system familiarization.  The training

    f.  Regional Commands, Installation Commanding Officers and Tenant 
Commands will: 
        (1) Publish this policy to all subordinate commands/activities. 
        (2) Ensure that ESS is not procured outside of the requirements 
described above; 
        (3) Ensure that ESS requirements are identified early in project
