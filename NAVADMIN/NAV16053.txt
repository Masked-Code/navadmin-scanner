RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits leadership assistance in capturing command 
pass coordinator (CPC) workload data associated with a Navy Manpower Analysis 
Center (NAVMAC) manpower requirements determination study. This effort is 
part of a broader study of requirements for the Navy’s Pay and Personnel
Administrative Support System and Afloat Pay and Personnel Programs, and is 
designed to improve all aspects of pay and personnel support to the fleet.

2.  NAVMACs data collection strategy will incorporate remote collection of 
CPC workload data through a virtual survey tool.  Beginning 1 March 2016,
NAVMAC will distribute this virtual tool to the CPCs through the CPC 
Coordinators at each Personnel Support Detachment.  The virtual data 
collection effort will run through 25 March 2016.

3.  In addition, CPC subject matter expert (SME) panels will be convened to 
review CPC processes and workload. NAVMAC will rely on CPC coordinators to 
distribute/manage panel schedules and to maximize SME participation.

4.  As discussed in reference (a), the CPC is a vital component of Navy’s 
overall pay and personnel services program.  The success of this data 
collection effort depends on maximum CPC involvement.

5.  Points of contact are Mr. Doyle Avant, head, manpower programs, NAVMAC at
(901) 874-6312/DSN 882 or via e-mail at doyle.avant(at)navy.mil and
Mr. Timothy Reeves, industrial engineer, NAVMAC at (901) 874-6321/DSN 882 or 
via email at timothy.d.reeves(at)navy.mil.
