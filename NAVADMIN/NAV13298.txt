RMKS/1. Campaign Drug Free (CDF) is one of six Navy Flagship Programs that 
provide meaningful command-sponsored community service projects. This award 
recognizes those programs that best reach out to teach children about the 
dangers of drug abuse and promote healthy, drug-free lifestyles.

2. As the Navy's executive agent for Campaign Drug Free, it is a pleasure to 
announce the 2013 Campaign Drug Free Flagship Award winning commands:
 
A.  Small Shore Winner:  Naval Air Facility Washington D.C.
B.  Medium Shore Winner:  Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit, 
Keesler MS
C.  Large Shore Winner:  Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay 
D.  Large Overseas Winner:  Naval Hospital Guam

3.  Participation in Campaign Drug Free activities benefits local 
communities, as well as the Sailors and civilians who serve as volunteers.  
All commands are encouraged to develop partnerships through Navy community 
service programs to promote volunteerism and assist in the education of our 
nation's youth.

4.  Congratulations to all our award winners and nominees.  Please accept my 
personal thanks for your support of this important Navy community service 
program.  
Award winners will receive formal recognition of their exceptional
