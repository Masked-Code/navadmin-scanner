RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Advancement Examination Readiness Review 
(AERR) schedule from April to September 2022.  AERR events provide an 
opportunity for selected rating subject matter experts from Fleet and shore-
based commands to impact their respective ratings by updating and validating 
the examination question bank.  Selected chief, senior chief, and master 
chief petty officers on Active Duty, Full-Time Support and Reservists 
currently on Active Duty for Operational Support may take part in the 
process. AERRs enable the Navy to advance the most qualified and rating- 
knowledgeable Sailors. 
 
2.  AERRs are held at Naval Education and Training Professional Development 
Center (NETPDC) in Pensacola, FL.  Temporary duty travel (TDY) in support of 
AERR events is considered mission critical and is flag officer approved.  All 
costs pertaining to temporary duty are funded by NETPDC.  All travel will be 
in line with Department of the Navy regulations at the time of the scheduled 
AERR. 
 
3.  In line with reference (a), type commanders (TYCOM) and rating sponsors 
will recruit rating Fleet subject matter experts (FSME), select AERR
