RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces updates to the High Year Tenure
(HYT) policy by amending HYT length of service (LOS) gates for master chief 
petty officers currently serving as rated command master chiefs or NEC 
qualified command master chiefs in the case of Full Time Support (FTS) and 
Selected Reserve (SELRES) master chief petty officers.  Revisions to 
references (a) and (b) are forthcoming and will be published at a later date.  
All other HYT policy contained in reference (b) remains in effect.

2.  The HYT policy of the Navy establishes LOS gates by paygrade.
The Navys continuing efforts to improve retention of talented and experienced 
Sailors includes retention of our best senior enlisted leaders during the 
height of their knowledge, education, and value to our organization.  This 
NAVADMIN will also grant the additional time needed to gain experience to 
prepare them, as they progress in their careers, to serve Flag or General 
Officers (FO/GO), Commanding Officers, and Sailors.

3.  Effective 1 January 2019, HYT policy is amended to reflect new LOS gates 
for rated Active Duty Fleet (FLTCM), Force (FORCM) and Command (CMDCM) master 
chiefs and NEC qualified FTS and SELRES master chiefs.  Effective 1 January 
2019, HYT LOS gates are as
follows:
    Rating                              HYT (current)  HYT (new)
    All MCPO ratings except             30             30
        CMDCM/FORCM/FLTCM
    CMDCM                               30             32
    CMDCM (1/2-star FO/GO)              32             34
    CMDCM/FORCM/FLTCM (3/4-star FO/GO)  35             36
    MCPON                               38             38

4.  Eligibility guidelines.  For those personnel planning to transition to 
the Fleet Reserve or retire under current HYT LOS, and who would be subject 
to the new HYT LOS gates effective
1 January 2019, the following guidelines are provided:
    a.  AC and FTS members who currently have approved Fleet Reserve or 
retirement dates on or after 1 January 2019 and before their new HYT LOS must 
decide no later than 31 October 2018 if an opportunity for placement into a 
new assignment exists, either through the Command Senior Enlisted Leader 
Management Office
(CSELMO) Director (for FO/GO opportunities) or through the Command Senior 
Enlisted Leader (CSEL) Detailer.
        (1) If an opportunity for placement into a new assignment is not 
possible, the member will not remain on active duty and will execute their 
Fleet Reserve or Retirement orders as originally planned.
        (2) If an opportunity for placement into a new assignment is 
possible, and in line with paragraph 4a above and reference (c), members with 
an approved Fleet Reserve or retirement date who desire to remain on active 
duty will submit a cancellation request to Commander, Navy Personnel Command 
(COMNAVPERSCOM) Enlisted Retirements Office (PERS-836) at the following e-
mail address:
enlisted_active_duty_retirements(at)navy.mil.  Once received, approval of 
Fleet Reserve or retirement cancellation requests serves as authority to 
cancel previously issued retirement orders, which are issued by the local 
supporting personnel office, and serves as authority for members to obligate 
additional service to reach the new HYT date, as directed on the new set of 
issued orders.  PERS-836 will forward all approved cancellation requests to 
COMNAVPERSCOM, Enlisted Assignment Division (PERS-40).
    b.  Members in receipt of either Fleet Reserve or retirement orders who 
have executed any portion of those orders, to include movement of household 
goods or dependents, shall include this information in their request to PERS-
836 for Fleet Reserve and retirement to be considered for approval on a case-
by-case basis.
    c.  SELRES members who reach HYT on or after 1 January 2019 and before 
the new proposed HYT gates must decide no later than
31 October 2018 if an opportunity for placement into a new assignment exists 
through the Force Master Chief of the Navy Reserve.  If placement is not 
possible, the member will not remain in the Reserves and will be required to 
submit for retirement (with or without pay).  Orders will be issued by 
Commander, Navy Reserve Forces Command (CNRFC) upon approval.
    d.  Reserve Component Master Chief Petty Officers of the Individual Ready 
Reserve that have the 8CMC NEC and are assigned to the Voluntary Training 
Unit are not in a CMDCM billet.  Those MCPOs that desire to mobilize to a 
validated E9 8CMC requirement will be screened by Commander Navy Reserve 
Forces Command and if applicable can submit a HYT Waiver request as outlined 
in reference (b).

5.  Points of contact.  For HYT policy related questions, commands and 
members can contact:
