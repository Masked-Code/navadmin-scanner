RMKS/1.  Director, Navy Staff - Directives, Forms and Information Management 
Control Branch (DNS-15) was established in the interest of references (a) 
through (d).  Policy contained within calls for transparency and efficiency 
in government through management of policy, forms and information 
collections.  Adherence to these programs is mandatory. 

2.  Directives Management:  Directives establish policy, define roles and 
responsibilities and provide authority for forms and information collections.  
In accordance with reference (e) directives should, but are not limited to:

a. be essential to the effective administration or operation of activities 
concerned;
b. have the widest distribution and availability;
c. not duplicate directives from higher authority;
d. not establish undue administrative burden; and
e. abide by required style and formatting requirements.

OPNAV directives are formally published on the Department of the Navy 
Issuances Web site http://doni.documentservices.dla.mil and questions about 
Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) directives may be sent to 
sn_op_directives@navy.mil.  Commands that originate and or sponsor directives 
shall have personnel complete the following directives training modules on 
Navy Knowledge Online https://www.nko.navy.mil DOR-END-1.0 (Essentials for 
Navy Directives) and DOR-SDFSC-1.0 (Specific Directives Formatting and 
Special Cases).

3.  Forms Management:  Forms are the most efficient method to transmit like 
data in both human and machine readable formats.  Forms should never be 
issued as "templates" or "formats", shall be reviewed against the legal 
requirements for data collected, and must contain proper classification 
markings and supersession statements.  In accordance with reference (f) forms 
should, but are not limited to:

a. contain neutral non-offensive language;
b. be created in keeping with needs for assistive technology (508 
compliance);
c. not duplicate higher level forms;
d. have clear and logical layouts;
e. be linked to at least one authorizing document; and
f. abide by all requirements on collection and use of controlled and 
sensitive information.

All forms within the Department of the Navy (DON) are to be formally 
published on the Naval Forms OnLine Web site 
htps://navalforms.documentservices.dla.mil/web/public/home and questions 
about DON forms may be sent to opnav.donforms.dns51@navy.mil.  Commands that 
originate and or sponsor forms shall have personnel complete the following 
forms training modules on Navy Knowledge Online https://www.nko.navy.mil DOR-
GFMGFUT-1.0 (General Forms Management, General Forms User Training) and DOR-
GFMFMOT-1.0 (General Forms Management, Forms Management Officer Training).

4.  Information Management Control:  Information Management Control has been 
historically called "Reports Control" in the Navy.  The name "Reports 
Control" is misleading as this program is the umbrella program for 
information management and is concerned with the establishment of information 
requirements and the evaluation of the human and material cost associated 
with each information collection activity.  Information requirements fall 
into one of two categories; authorized and unauthorized.  Authorized 
collections may be exempt, excepted and symbolized.  Exempt and excepted 
information requirements are those that align with predetermined elements 
defined in reference (g) and are not immediately required to go through cost-
to-benefit analysis.  Symbolized collections are required to go thorough 
cost-to-benefit analysis and if approved are assigned a control number and 
are approved for up to three years.  In accordance with reference (g) 
information requirements should, but are not limited to:

a. be reviewed by a subject matter expert to ensure compliance with all 
statutory requirements;
b. be identified in the command's information collections index;
c. not duplicate another information requirement in the DON, DoD or 
Federal government;
d. only collect information that meets current active requirements;
e. be established with a minimum of impact; and
f. be linked to at least one authorizing document.

5.  DNS-15 is working to maintain accurate and up to date OPNAV directives, 
forms and information requirements indexes.  In keeping with this aim, a 
comprehensive review of all directives older than 5 years as well as a zero-
based review of all OPNAV forms are currently underway.

6.  In order to enhance enterprise awareness of requirements on directives, 
forms and information collections, DNS-15 will be providing a series of 
training and information sessions using Defense Connect Online 
https://www.dco.dod.mil/content/connect/meetings/en/log_in.html virtual 
meeting room platform.  Training announcement memorandums will be sent to all 
echelon 1 and 2 commands for further dissemination to subordinate commands.  

7.  Overview material about these programs may be downloaded from 
https://doni.documentservices.dla.mil/General%20Items/DNS-
15%20Programs%20Overview.pdf.  This information is intended for widest 
distribution and is relevant to all Naval personnel.
