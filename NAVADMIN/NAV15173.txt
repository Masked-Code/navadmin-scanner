An officer who chooses to decline his or her promotion must submit the

have the authority to delay projected appointments.  Upon the exercise of a 
delay, the officer shall be notified in writing before the effective date of 
the appointment, and not be tendered the appointment.  The delay authority 
will immediately forward the recommendation to delay with supporting 
documentation to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-83), copy to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806).

4.  COs are reminded of their responsibility to ensure the officers they are 
promoting are mentally, physically, morally and professionally qualified.  
Per reference (a), officers are ineligible for promotion if they have failed 
the most recent Physical Fitness Assessment.  COs shall verify the promoting 
officer's information in the Physical Readiness Information Management System

accordance with paragraph 3 if required.

5.  Prepare a Delivery of Temporary/Permanent Appointment (NAVPERS form

title 10, U.S. Code as reference (b), for permanent lieutenants and above.  
Use section 578 of title 10, U.S. Code 578 as reference (b), for chief 
warrant officers.  Use sections 624 and 5589 of title 10, U.S. Code as 
reference (b), for limited duty officer promotion to lieutenant.  Limited 
duty officer appointment to lieutenant is a permanent appointment; acceptance 
of the appointment is acceptance of permanent appointment as a limited duty
