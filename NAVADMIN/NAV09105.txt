RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN, THE SIXTH IN A SERIES ON THE JOINT 
QUALIFICATION SYSTEM (JQS), PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON AWARDING OF 
DISCRETIONARY POINTS FOR DESIGNATED JOINT TRAINING/EDUCATION AND JOINT 
EXERCISES.

2.  AS OUTLINED IN REFS A THROUGH E, THE JQS REPLACES THE PREVIOUS 
DESIGNATION OF JOINT SPECIALTY OFFICER (JSO) WITH THE NEW DESIGNATION 
OF JOINT QUALIFIED OFFICER (JQO).  OFFICERS CONTINUE TO BE REQUIRED TO 
COMPLETE JOINT PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION (JPME) PHASES I AND II 
FOR DESIGNATION AS JQO (RESERVISTS WILL GENERALLY SUBSTITUTE ADVANCE 
JPME FOR PHASE II).
ALTHOUGH THE PRIMARY MEANS TO ACHIEVE JOINT EXPERIENCE WILL REMAIN 
THROUGH AN ASSIGNMENT TO A BILLET LISTED ON THE JOINT DUTY ASSIGNMENT 
LIST (JDAL), THE JQS ALLOWS OFFICERS TO ACCUMULATE POINTS TOWARDS JOINT 
QUALIFICATION THROUGH JOINT EXPERIENCE, JOINT TRAINING/EDUCATION, AND 
JOINT EXERCISES.

3.  AS PROMULGATED IN REFS A THROUGH E, OFFICERS MAY SELF-NOMINATE 
THEIR JOINT EXPERIENCES THROUGH THE JQS SELF-NOMINATION WEB SITE, 
LOCATED AT HTTPS://WWW.DMDC.OSD.MIL/APPJ/JMIS/JQSINDEX.JSP
(ALL LOWER CASE EXCEPT JQS), FOR CONSIDERATION OF POINT CREDIT BY THE 
JQS EXPERIENCE REVIEW PANEL.  THE WEB SITE PROVIDES DIRECTIONS FOR 
SELF-NOMINATION, AS WELL AS HOW TO SEND SUPPORTING DATA FOR THE JOINT 
CREDIT REQUEST.
    A.  ADDITIONAL JQS INFORMATION, INCLUDING LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE 
JOINT STAFF 2008 JQS EXPERIENCE REVIEW PANELS, CAN BE FOUND ON THE NAVY 
PERSONNEL COMMAND (NPC) JOINT OFFICER MATTERS WEB SITE AT 
WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/OFFICER/JOINTOFFICER.
    B.  DATES OF FUTURE CY-09 JQS REVIEW PANELS ARE 18-22 MAY,
24-28 AUGUST, AND 16-20 NOVEMBER 2009.  OFFICERS SHOULD CHECK THE NPC 
WEB SITE REGULARLY FOR POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THESE DATES AND SUSPENSE 
DATES FOR SUBMISSIONS.

4.  THE JQS ACKNOWLEDGES THAT OFFICERS ALSO GAIN EXPERTISE IN JOINT 
MATTERS BASED ON THEIR PARTICIPATION IN JOINT TRAINING, JOINT 
EXERCISES, AND FORMS OF JOINT EDUCATION, OTHER THAN JPME.  THESE TYPES 
OF OPPORTUNITIES MAY ALSO GARNER DISCRETIONARY POINTS, WHICH ARE POINTS 
EARNED IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENT.  
HOWEVER, DISCRETIONARY POINTS ALONE WILL NOT ENABLE AN OFFICER TO EARN 
JOINT QUALIFICATION.  FOR THE 36 JOINT QUALIFICATION POINTS REQUIRED 
FOR JQO, A MAXIMUM OF 12 POINTS CAN BE DERIVED FROM DISCRETIONARY 
POINTS.  OF THESE 12 DISCRETIONARY POINTS, ONLY SIX CAN BE APPLIED TO 
LEVEL II AND ONLY SIX CAN BE APPLIED TO LEVEL III, PER REFS F AND G.
    A.  THE JOINT STAFF HAS PROVIDED INTERIM GUIDANCE ON AWARDING OF 
DISCRETIONARY POINTS FOR DESIGNATED JOINT TRAINING/EDUCATION AND 
EXERCISES AND HAS AUTHORIZED THE SERVICES AND THE NATIONAL GUARD BUREAU 
TO AWARD DISCRETIONARY POINTS TO ELIGIBLE OFFICERS.
THIS REVISION IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO 
CHANGE ONE TO REF F.
    B.  A LIST OF CERTIFIED COURSES HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND WILL BE 
MAINTAINED BY THE DIRECTORATE OF OPERATIONAL PLANS AND JOINT FORCE 
DEVELOPMENT (JOINT STAFF/J7) ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT 
CHIEFS OF STAFF (CJCS).  THE LIST OF RESIDENT AND DISTANCE LEARNING 
COURSES IS AVAILABLE THROUGH JOINT KNOWLEDGE ONLINE (JKO) AT 
HTTP://WWW.DTIC.MIL/DOCTRINE/JQS.HTM
(ALL LOWER CASE - LINK FOR JQO POINTS REPORT, APPENDIX A).  JOINT 
QUALIFICATION POINTS WILL BE BASED ON COURSE CONTENT AND DURATION.
ONLY COURSES COMPLETED AFTER 11 SEPTEMBER 2001 ARE ELIGIBLE FOR POINT 
CREDIT.
    C.  PER REF F, THE CJCS SHALL IDENTIFY, MAINTAIN, AND ANNUALLY 
PUBLISH A LIST OF JOINT EXERCISES THAT QUALIFY FOR THE AWARD OF JOINT 
QUALIFICATION POINTS.  THE LIST OF APPROVED EXERCISES FOR DISCRETIONARY 
POINTS IS AVAILABLE ON JKO (LINK PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 4.B).  ONLY 
JOINT EXERCISES CONDUCTED AFTER 11 SEPTEMBER 2001 ARE ELIGIBLE FOR 
POINT CREDIT.
DISCRETIONARY POINTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE INDIVIDUAL'S
PARTICIPATION:
        (1)  LEADER - THREE POINTS.  EXERCISES FORMAL AUTHORITY AND 
DIRECTION OVER SIGNIFICANT ORGANIZATIONAL ELEMENTS OR MAJOR TASKS.
        (2)  PLANNER - TWO POINTS.  SERVES AS THE FOCAL POINT FOR AN 
ACTIVITY OR ORGANIZATION AND IS EMPOWERED TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THEIR 
ORGANIZATION AND MAKE COMMITMENTS FOR SPECIFIED SUPPORT.
THERE CAN BE MORE THAN ONE PLANNER.
        (3)  PARTICIPANT - ONE POINT.  A PERSON ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN AN 
EVENT CAPABLE OF MAKING POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE MISSION.
    D.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON DISCRETIONARY POINTS CAN BE FOUND ON 
THE NPC JOINT OFFICER MATTERS WEB SITE.  OFFICERS CAN SUBMIT A REQUEST 
FOR DISCRETIONARY POINTS TO THE JQS SERVICE MANAGER NPC (PERS-45) VIA 
E-MAIL.  THE REQUEST SHALL STATE WHETHER SUBMITTING FOR EXERCISE OR

LOCATED ON NPC'S WEB SITE.
SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS SHOULD BE PROVIDED AS ATTACHMENTS.  EXAMPLES 
INCLUDE FITREPS, AWARDS, EXERCISE MANNING LIST, COURSE COMPLETION 
CERTIFICATE AND COURSE ROSTER.  SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION SHOULD 
EXPLICITLY STATE THE LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION IN THE EXERCISE.  IF NOT 
STATED, THE LEVEL WILL BE ASSIGNED BY THE SERVICE MANAGER.
ONLY EXERCISES AND COURSES ON THE CJCS APPROVED LIST SHALL BE 
CONSIDERED.
    E.  NPC (PERS-45) WILL PROVIDE FINAL APPROVAL AUTHORITY FOR 
AWARDING DISCRETIONARY POINTS AND WILL SUBMIT A MONTHLY LIST OF 
APPROVED POINTS TO THE DMDC FOR UPLOAD INTO THE JOINT MANPOWER 
INFORMATION SYSTEM.  DISCRETIONARY POINTS GUIDANCE IS OUTLINED IN REF
