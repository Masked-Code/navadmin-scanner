SUBJ/ALASKA SEA SERVICES SCHOLARSHIP FOR ACADEMIC YEAR 2007-2008// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE REQUIREMENTS AND 
SOLICITS APPLICATIONS FOR THE ALASKA SEA SERVICES SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM.

2.  BACKGROUND:  CITIZENS OF ALASKA RAISED FUNDS FOR A $10,000 WAR BOND 
AS A GIFT TO THE USS JUNEAU (CL 52) DURING WORLD WAR II.
AFTER THE SINKING OF THE USS JUNEAU, THIS GIFT WAS TO HAVE BEEN 
PRESENTED TO THE USS ALASKA (CB 1).  HOWEVER, THE USS ALASKA WAS 
DECOMMISSIONED BEFORE THE PURCHASE AND PRESENTATION.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE 
GOVERNOR OF THE TERRITORY OF ALASKA AND THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY 
AGREED THAT THE BOND WOULD BE LEFT ON DEPOSIT IN THE FIRST NATIONAL 
BANK OF JUNEAU UNTIL THE USS ALASKA WAS RECOMMISSIONED OR ANOTHER 
APPROPRIATE APPLICATION OF THESE MONIES COULD BE MADE.  IN 1986, THE 
NAVY ESTABLISHED THE ALASKA SEA SERVICES SCHOLARSHIP FUND.
