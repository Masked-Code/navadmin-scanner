RMKS/1.  As a follow-up to reference (a), the Army reactivated its Aviation 
and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center
(AMRDEC) SAFE website, which offers online exchange of large data files 
between Department of Defense, other governmental, and civilian agencies, to 
include Personally Identifiable Information
(PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI).  AMRDEC SAFE may be used for 
this purpose immediately.  This is expected to be available for six months as 
replacement options are identified.

2.  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is working on a long-term 
enterprise solution to support transfer between CAC and non-CAC holders by 
Summer 2019.  Further details will be shared for the transition from AMRDEC 
SAFE to the new solution as the replacement service is identified by DISA.

3.  Alternative methods of information exchange outlined in reference
(a) are still valid options.  Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and Security 
Managers are responsible to ensure all practices comply with regulations 
governing PII/PHI and other content.

4.  Released by VADM Matthew J. Kohler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
