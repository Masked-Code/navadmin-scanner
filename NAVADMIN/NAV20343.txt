RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and directs additional actions 
to complete the Navys transition to Windows 10 Version 1909 (v1909).

2.  v1909 was released in November 2019 to improve the cybersecurity posture 
of the NMCI enterprise network and enhance performance.  As reflected in real 
world reporting, adversaries continue to probe DoD networks for 
vulnerabilities that can be exploited for their advantage.
    a.  As of 22 December, compliance stands at 81.6% for SIPR and 85.75% for
    NIPR and the Navy must complete this transition without further delay.

3.  All workstations that have not been upgraded to v1909 will be placed in 
quarantine to prevent access to network resources.  These assets will remain 
in quarantine until successfully upgraded to v1909.
    a.  2300Z, 29 January 2021, all non-compliant SIPR workstations will be
    placed in quarantine.
    b.  2300Z, 26 February 2021, all non-compliant NIPR workstations will be
    placed in quarantine.
    c.  For workstations that are offline, commands are required to 
immediately connect, turn on, and log-in allowing workstation to receive all 
updates and upgrade to v1909.
          (1)  Users must launch the Seat Health Check app found on the 
desktop /start menu to verify if their workstation is ready to update.
          (2)  If the workstation is ready, the app can also be used to start
          the update.
          (3)  A detailed user information guide is available at https
          ://www.homeport.navy.mil/management/windows10/.
    d.  For workstations having problems receiving updates that allow the
    upgrade to v1909, users need to contact the NMCI helpdesk and open a 
trouble ticket at 866-THE-NMCI (866-843-6624) or through the NMCI Homeport at 
https://www.homeport.navy.mil/home/.
    e.  Remediation of quarantined v1803 workstations will likely require 
local reimaging of machines, a relatively labor and time-intensive process.  
COVID-19 adds additional logistics challenges with a large number of 
workstations being used in a remote, telework configuration.  It is 
imperative that commands take early action to address these cases, taking 
advantage of this window, and tailoring impact to local operations.

4.  NMCI workstations identified as no longer required must be returned by 
the Contract Technical Representative (CTR) to prevent the Navy from funding 
assets no longer in active use.

5.  Released by VADM Jeffrey E. Trussler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations 
for Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
