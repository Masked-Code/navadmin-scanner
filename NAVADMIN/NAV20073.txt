SUBJ/TEMPORARY RELAXATION OF HAIR GROOMING STANDARDS IN RESPONSE TO 
CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK//

REF/A/DOC/COMNAVPERSCOM/1JAN03//

AMPN/REF A IS NAVPERS 15665I, U.S. NAVY UNIFORM REGULATIONS

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the temporary relaxation of male and female 
hair length grooming standards to minimize Sailors exposure to COVID-19 and 
adhere to social distancing requirements.

2.  Due to COVID-19 force health protection measures maximizing social 
distancing, commanding officers (CO) are authorized to relax the Navy hair 
length grooming standards outlined in reference (a) for Sailors assigned to 
their command.  Relaxed hair length grooming standards will only apply to the 
area of the scalp.  Reference (a) policy guidance regarding sideburns, hair 
styles and shaving requirements remain in effect.  COs may allow for 
additional hair length and bulk on the sides, top and back of the head, but 
at no time will relaxed grooming interfere with the proper wearing of Navy 
head gear and proper use of protective personal equipment (helmets, masks, 
hoods, etc.).  Good judgement of leaders at all levels of the chain of 
command is required to ensure all possible COVID-19 force health protection 
precautions are being taken.

3.  Questions regarding this NAVADMIN should be addressed to Mr.
Robert B. Carroll, Navy Uniform Matters Office (OPNAV N13X), via e- mail at 
robert.b.carroll(at)navy.mil, CMDCM Marisol S. Dumlao, (OPNAV N13X) via e-
mail at marisol.dumlao(at)navy.mil or PSCS Alexandre D. Adriano at 
alexandre.d.adriano(at)navy.mil.

4.  Feedback and recommendations regarding uniform policy, uniform components 
and uniform availability are welcome and can be provided via MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/, select Professional Resources, U.S. Navy Uniforms 
and *Ask The Chiefs.*  Feedback can also be provided via the MyNavy UNIFORMS
