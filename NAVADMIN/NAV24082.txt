SUBJ/CONVENING OF THE FY25 TRAINING AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE RESERVE (TAR) 
COMMANDER SELECTIVE RETENTION BOARD// 
 
REF/A/DOC/SECNAV/24JUL19// 
AMPN/REF A IS SECNAVINST 1920.6D, ADMINISTRATIVE SEPARATION OF OFFICERS.// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 
Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) Commander (O5) Selective 
Retention (SELRET) board. 
 
2.  The SELRET board is authorized to retain TAR O-5s who have twice 
failed of selection for promotion to the grade of O-6 and are not on 
a promotion list to a higher grade in order to meet requirements and 
authorized end strength. 
 
3.  The FY25 TAR Commander SELRET board will convene on 10 June 
2024 to consider TAR O-5s in all competitive categories for 
retention.  In line with reference (a), TAR O-5s not selected for 
retention will retire or be released from Active Duty not later than 
the first day of the seventh calendar month beginning after the 
month in which the SELRET board results are released.  TAR officers 
will be retained on Active Duty, if necessary, to enable the officer 
to become eligible for a regular Active Duty retirement.  In no case 
will retention of TAR O-5s on Active Duty extend beyond the first 
day of the month following the month in which the officers complete 
28 years of commissioned service, subject to the exceptions in 
reference (a), as applicable. 
 
4.  Amplifying information can be accessed via MyNavy HR website at 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Officer/Reserve-OCM/TAR/TAR-Continuation/.  The authorized number 
of selections for retention will be posted as part of the board convening 
order after the board adjourns. 
 
5.  Only eligible officers may communicate with the selection board via the 
Letter to the Board (LTB) process.  An example letter to selection boards is 
available on the TAR continuation website. NAVADMIN 220/19 announced the 
introduction of the application known as Electronic Submission of Selection 
Board Documents (ESSBD), accessible through MyNavy Portal (MNP).  ESSBD 
improves the speed, transparency and confidence of receipt over current LTB 
submission methods, such as hard copy and e-mail submitted letters and 
related attachments. 
    a.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to electronically 
submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without attachments, 
and will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) exactly what 
will be delivered and presented to the board. 
    b.  To utilize ESSBD, candidates must log into BOL at 
https://www.bol.navy.mil/ and select ESSBD (Submit letter to Selection 
Board).  Once there, candidates must select LTB and on-screen instructions 
will direct the submitter thereafter. 
    c.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted. 
    d.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command no later than 2359 
(central time zone) 10 days prior to the convening date of the respective 
board, as noted below.  Submitters are cautioned not to wait until the 
deadline date to submit LTBs via ESSBD or other available avenues. 
    e.  Timeline are as follows: 
Selection Board         Convening Date       Due Date/Time 
TAR CDR SELRET Board    10 JUN 24            30 MAY 24/2359 CST 
    f.  If sending a board package from a non-NMCI network (bumed.mil, 
eu.navy.mil, etc.), please review procedures listed in NAVADMIN 220/19. 
    g.  The written communication may call attention to the board, any matter 
concerning the record of the officer that the officer considers 
important.  Written communication may include, as enclosures, correspondence 
from any individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not 
originated by the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of 
the eligible officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must 
contain a written acknowledgement by the eligible officer that they desire 
such correspondence be presented to the board. 
Correspondence without such an acknowledgement is considered third party 
correspondence and will be returned without being presented to the 
board.  Classified correspondence will not be accepted. 
 
6.  Point of contact is CDR Kirk Morris, TAR Officer Community Manager 
(BUPERS 351C), at (901) 874-4346/DSN 882 or via e-mail at 
kirk.n.morris.mil@us.navy.mil. 
 
7.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
