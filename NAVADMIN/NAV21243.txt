RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces an update to reference (a) and is applicable 
to all USN systems under Navy Authorizing Official (NAO) and Functional 
Authorizing Official (FAO) authorities. 
 
2.  The following appendices have been incorporated into reference (a) to 
reduce administrative burden for stakeholders executing the RMF Process. 
    a.  Streamlined Risk Management Framework (RMF) Review Process:  This 
process is designed to leverage reference (b) to optimize the Navy RMF Assess 
and Authorize process, decrease duplicative reviews, and expedite RMF 
Authority to Operate (ATO) decisions. 
    b.  RMF Reauthorization Upon ATO Expiration Guide: This provides 
specifications necessary for implementing RMF Step 6 for systems that have a 
current ATO and the work actions required to obtain a streamlined RMF Static 
Reauthorization for eligible systems.  This guide establishes the first steps 
toward implementing RMF Ongoing Authorizations. 
 
3.  In addition to reference (a) updates, the Defense-in-Depth Functional 
Implementation Architecture (DFIA) Shore Inheritance Model (SIM) version 1 
(v1) has been released. In alignment with reference (c), the DFIA SIM 
provides an inheritance model for shore-based systems.  The SIMv1 is 
applicable to Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command Facility systems 
only, but future releases will continue to refine the model to provide 
additional inheritable controls for all shore environments and future 
requirements. 
 
4.  The RMF Reform Focus Team led by Director, Navy Enterprise Networks and 
Cybersecurity (OPNAV N2N6D), Commander, Naval Information Warfare Systems 
Command, and U.S. Fleet Cyber Command are making strides to standardize, 
streamline, and increase the speed and outcomes of the Navy RMF process. 
 
5.  The updated RMF Process Guide and DFIA SIM are available on the USN RMF 
Portal 
at:  https://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs/OPNAV/N2N6/DDCION/N2N6BC4/RMF/SitePa
ges/Home.aspx 
 
6.  Updates are effective and available for use immediately.  For Echelon IIs 
that require development of additional internal routing procedures, updates 
must be implemented NLT 1 December 2021. 
 
7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until it is cancelled or superseded. 
 
8.  Released by VADM Jeffrey E. Trussler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations 
for Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
