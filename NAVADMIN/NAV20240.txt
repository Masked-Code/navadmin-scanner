IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces General Military Training (GMT) requirements 
for fiscal year (FY) 2021.  In line with reference (a), the Navy has 
minimized the number of mandatory GMT training topics to empower commanders 
to decide what training their personnel should receive and how often they 
should receive it.  Commanding Officers (CO) should review the Command 
Discretion GMT list to determine the frequency and method of additional 
training appropriate for their command.

2.  FY-21 Mandatory GMT Requirements
    a.  Mandatory GMT must be completed by all military personnel in the 
fiscal year.
    b.  The following Mandatory GMT is required to be completed in
FY-21:
        (1) Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Awareness.
        (2) Cyber Awareness Challenge.
        (3) Counterintelligence Awareness and Reporting.
        (4) Records Management.
        (5) Suicide Prevention.
    c.  Personnel with less than 3 years of time-in-service must also 
complete Antiterrorism Level 1 training annually.  For personnel with greater 
than 3 years of time-in-service, Antiterrorism Level 1 is now a triennial 
requirement and will be mandated for all hands in FY-22.
    d.  Commands may elect to complete Cyber Awareness Challenge training 
using instructor-led and/or computer-based methods.
    e.  Privacy Act training is required biennially and will be mandated for 
all hands in FY-22.
    f.  Combating Trafficking in Persons training is required within
1 year of initial entry of service.
    g.  The recommended method of delivery for SAPR and Suicide Prevention 
annual training is via face-to-face, small group facilitated discussions.  
While this remains the most effective lesson delivery method, this NAVADMIN 
authorizes COs to adapt or modify FY-21 SAPR and Suicide Prevention GMT 
delivery methods consistent with coronavirus mitigation procedures and 
operational commitments to meet these training requirements.  If in-person, 
face-to-face delivery is not feasible, the preferred alternative is 
facilitated small group training via teleconference, Defense Collaboration 
Services or Commercial Virtual Remote Microsoft Teams.
SAPR and Suicide Prevention training is not authorized with non- Department 
of Defense (DOD) approved collaborative technology (e.g.
Facebook, Zoom, etc.).  During this pandemic environment, facilitated small 
group training using approved video conferencing technology is considered 
*face-to-face,* fully meeting training requirements.  Senior Commanders have 
the authority to issue guidance that is more restrictive to their subordinate 
commands.

3.  FY-21 Command Discretion GMT
    a.  Command Discretion GMT is not required at any specified periodicity, 
but may have situational requirements (i.e. initial entry, pre-deployment, 
career milestones, etc.).  COs should train their personnel at a time and 
place that best meets their command and mission needs.
    b.  COs may assign the following topics at their discretion:
        (1) Alcohol, Drugs and Tobacco Awareness.
        (2) Combating Trafficking in Persons.
        (3) Domestic Violence Prevention and Reporting.
        (4) Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare.
        (5) Energy Policy.
        (6) Equal Opportunity, Harassment and Resolution Options.
        (7) Hazing Policy and Prevention.
        (8) Operational Risk Management.
        (9) Operations Security.
        (10) Personal Financial Management.
        (11) Sexual Health and Responsibility.
        (12) Stress Management.
        (13) Traumatic Brain Injury.
        (14) Privacy Act.
        (15) Antiterrorism Level 1.
        (16) Tactical Combat Casualty Care  All Service Member/ Tier 1.
    c.  Financial Management training does not have a mandatory periodicity, 
but it is required at career touchpoints in line with reference (b).

4.  Additional Information
    a.  Detailed requirements for each topic are listed on the GMT webpage 
and should be reviewed thoroughly by commands prior to assigning training.  
The webpage provides topic-specific information such as:
        (1) Instructor and documentation requirements.
        (2) Training in combined military-civilian sessions.
        (3) Links to instructor guides and other training products.
    b.  The GMT webpage can be found on the MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/general-skills-training/gmt/.
    c.  Current SAPR and Suicide Prevention training materials are not 
designed for individual/self-study training and using methods other than 
facilitated, small group sessions will be challenging.
Feedback, lessons learned or recommendations for more effective training 
delivery is encouraged.  Please provide your recommendations or refer any 
questions to the following points of

    d.  All SAPR training materials are For Official Use Only.  SAPR training 
material shall not be loaded onto publically accessible websites (e.g. 
YouTube, Facebook, etc.).  Additionally, the following disclaimer should be 
added at the beginning of each SAPR training session that is not conducted in
