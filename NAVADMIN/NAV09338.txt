GROUPS//

RMKS/1.  THE NAVY SEA CADET CORPS (NSCC) IS A NON-PROFIT YOUTH 
ORGANIZATION SPONSORED BY THE NAVY LEAGUE OF THE UNITED STATES.
THEIR GOAL IS TO ACQUAINT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WITH THE NAVY AND 
INTRODUCE THEM TO THE VALUES OF MILITARY SERVICE.  FOLLOWING HIGH 
SCHOOL, THE MAJORITY OF SEA CADETS ENTER THE SEA SERVICES IN EITHER AN 
ENLISTED OR OFFICER PROGRAM.  APPROXIMATELY 12 PERCENT OF EACH ENTERING 
CLASS AT THE U.S. NAVAL ACADEMY IS PRIOR SEA CADETS.

2.  IN EVERY STATE THROUGHOUT OUR NATION, SEA CADETS ACTIVELY INTRODUCE 
OUR NAVY TO TODAY'S YOUTH - WE MUST SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS.
THE PROGRAM'S GREATEST NEEDS ARE QUALIFIED ADULT LEADERS AND TRAINING 
OPPORTUNITIES ON BOARD SHIPS, BASES, AND STATIONS.  NAVY PERSONNEL, 
THROUGH INVOLVEMENT AND SUPPORT OF THE NSCC, DIRECTLY IMPACT THE 
READINESS OF TOMORROW'S NAVY BY MENTORING THE NEXT GENERATION OF 
LEADERS.  REF A PROVIDES GUIDANCE CONCERNING COMMAND ASSISTANCE TO THE 
NSCC.

3.  NAVY COMMANDS AND PERSONNEL ARE ENCOURAGED TO FULLY SUPPORT SEA 
CADET UNITS, PARTICULARLY THOSE UNITS LOCATED IN AREAS WHERE NAVY 
PRESENCE IS LIMITED.  OPERATIONAL COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO INVITE 
NSCC UNITS TO TRAIN ON BOARD, IF SCHEDULES PERMIT.  ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION CAN BE OBTAINED BY CONTACTING NAVY RECRUITING COMMAND OR 
THE NSCC HEADQUARTERS.  DIRECT LIAISON WITH NSCC UNITS IS AUTHORIZED 
AND ENCOURAGED.
