2.  THE LATERAL TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION BOARD IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE.  EACH 
RECORD THAT IS PRESENTED TO THE BOARD IS CAREFULLY REVIEWED AND THE BEST AND 
MOST QUALIFIED ARE CHOSEN.

3.  QUOTA CONSTRAINTS FOR JUNIOR YEAR GROUPS (04 THROUGH 07) WERE ESPECIALLY 
TIGHT THUS THE DEMAND SIGNAL FAR EXCEEDED THE SUPPLY POOL.  MANY QUALITY 
APPLICANTS WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE BOARD BUT COULD NOT BE SELECTED DUE TO QUOTA 
CONSTRAINTS OF EITHER OUTGOING COMMUNITY OR GAINING COMMUNITY.  THEREFORE, NOT 
BEING SELECTED FOR THIS BOARD IS NOT A REASON TO FEEL THAT YOU HAVE NO FUTURE 
CHANCE.  YOU SHOULD APPLY AGAIN (AND AGAIN AS REQUIRED), ALL THE WHILE 
SUSTAINING SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE AND BOLSTERING YOUR RECORD FOR YOUR DESIRED 
COMMUNITY.
WHAT MAKES YOUR RECORD STANDOUT IS MOTIVATION TOWARDS YOUR GAINING COMMUNITY 
AS WELL AS CONTINUED PROMOTABILITY.

4.  AS ALWAYS, COMPETITION FOR REDESIGNATION WAS KEEN AND EVERY COMMUNITY HAD 
A POOL OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES.  ELIGIBLE OFFICERS NOT INITIALLY 
SELECTED, AND WHO DID NOT SPECIFICALLY REQUEST NOT TO BE REVIEWED BY 
COMMUNITIES OTHER THAN THEIR FIRST OR SECOND CHOICE, WERE SUBSEQUENTLY 
REVIEWED BY ALL OTHER COMMUNITIES.  THOSE OFFICERS TENTATIVELY SELECTED FOR 
COMMUNITIES NOT INITIALLY REQUESTED WILL BE NOTIFIED VIA OFFICIAL 
CORRESPONDENCE AND OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDESIGNATE.

5.  THE PROCESS, WHILE NEVER PERFECT, IS FAIR AND THOROUGH.
BOARD MEMBERS ARE FOCUSED ON THEIR TASK:  PICKING THE RIGHT CANDIDATE WHO IS 
FULLY AND BEST QUALIFIED FROM THE AVAILABLE APPLICANTS.  EACH RECORD RECEIVES 
A DETAILED SCRUB AND THERE IS THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE DISCUSSIONS ON EACH 
APPLICANT.

6.  THIS MESSAGE IS NOT AUTHORITY TO DELIVER CHANGE OF DESIGNATOR LETTERS TO 
THE SELECTEE.
    A.  OFFICERS WHO ARE PROMOTION SELECTEES SHOULD CONTACT THEIR CURRENT 
DETAILER TO DISCUSS REDESIGNATION TIMING.
COMMANDER, NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (COMNAVPERSCOM) (PERS-831), UPON 
NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) THAT THE SELECTEE HAS  BEEN MADE 
AVAILABLE TO THEIR NEW COMMUNITY, WILL FORWARD A REDESIGNATION LETTER TO THE 
SELECTEE OR APPOINTMENT ACCEPTANCE AND OATH OF OFFICE (NAVPERS 1000/4), AS 
APPLICABLE.
    B.  OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT PROMOTION SELECTEES AND WHO ARE NOT UNDER ORDERS 
CAN EXPECT ASSIGNMENT TO A NEW BILLET APPROPRIATE TO THEIR NEW DESIGNATION 
WHEN NOTIFIED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4).
    C.  IF A MEMBER IS CURRENTLY UNDER ORDERS AND TRANSFERS PRIOR TO 
NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4), MEMBER MUST EXECUTE ORDERS UNDER 
CURRENT DESIGNATOR AND MUST COMPLETE 12 MONTHS AT THE NEW ASSIGNMENT, UNLESS A 
SHORTER TOUR IS PRESCRIBED (TOURS IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR WILL BE WITH THE 
CONCURRENCE OF THE GAINING COMMUNITY), PRIOR TO REDESIGNATION.

7.  THE FOLLOWING ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE ABOVE:
    A.  SURFACE WARFARE (11XX) OFFICERS WHO ARE UNDER ORDERS TO DEPARTMENT 
HEAD SCHOOL MAY NOT LATERALLY TRANSFER UNTIL COMPLETION OF INITIAL DEPARTMENT 
HEAD TOUR.
    B.  AVIATION OFFICERS (131X AND 132X) SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED TO LATERAL 
TRANSFER UNTIL COMPLETION OF ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE OBLIGATION, EXPIRATION OF 
AVIATION CAREER CONTINUATION PAY CONTRACT, OR PLANNED ROTATION DATE, WHICHEVER 
IS LATER.
    C.  APPLICANTS FOR 1510 WHO ARE PRESENTLY DESIGNATED 131X OR 132X AND A 
SECOND SEA TOUR OR AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD TOUR HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED, MAY 
BE DELAYED ASSIGNMENT TO 1510 BILLETS UNTIL THE COMPLETION OF APPLICABLE 
SECOND SEA AND/OR AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD TOUR, AS DETERMINED BY 
COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-43).

8.  COMMANDING OFFICER SHALL:
    A.  ENSURE OFFICERS SELECTED FOR PROMOTION WITHIN THEIR CURRENT COMMUNITY 
DO NOT ACCEPT REDESIGNATION BEFORE THEIR PROMOTION DATE.
    B.  NOTIFY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-841) WITHIN 30 DAYS OF RELEASE OF THIS 
MESSAGE OF SELECTEES WHO DO NOT DESIRE TO ACCEPT TRANSFER/ REDESIGNATION.

9.  THE NEXT TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION BOARD WILL BE HELD
14 JUNE 2010.
APPLICATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 19 APRIL 2010.  PREVIOUS APPLICATIONS ARE NOT 
RETAINED, NON-SELECTEES FROM PREVIOUS BOARDS MUST SUBMIT A NEW APPLICATION FOR 
CONSIDERATION.
A FUTURE NAVADMIN WILL STIPULATE ALL OF THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND 
APPLICATION PROCEDURES IN ACCORDANCE WITH REFS A THRU D.
