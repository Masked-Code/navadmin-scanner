RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES CRITERIA FOR THE FY11 SHIPBOARD ENERGY 
CONSERVATION PORTION OF THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY ENERGY CONSERVATION AWARDS 
PROGRAM IAW REF A.  ALTHOUGH THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR OVER A 
DECADE, IT HAS TAKEN ON INCREASED SIGNIFICANCE SINCE 2009, WHEN REF B 
ANNOUNCED SECNAV'S DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY ENERGY TARGETS AND ESTABLISHED NEW 
OVERALL GOALS FOR ALTERNATIVE ENERGY USE, ENERGY CONSERVATION, AND EFFICIENCY.  
ENERGY CONSERVATION (ENCON) IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF ENERGY SECURITY, AND IS 
ONE OF SECNAV'S TOP PRIORITIES.  CREATING AN ENCON CULTURE THAT CONSIDERS 
ENERGY USE AS WE OPERATE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS IS ESSENTIAL TO A SECURE ENERGY 
FUTURE AND ACHIEVEMENT OF SECNAV'S GOALS.

2.  THE ENERGY CONSERVATION AWARDS PROGRAM PROMOTES EXCELLENCE IN ENERGY 
MANAGEMENT AND ENERGY CONSERVATION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY.  
RECOGNITION WILL BE GIVEN FOR OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY MANAGEMENT; 
INNOVATIONS IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY; AND ENERGY CONSERVING 
APPROACHES TO TRAINING, DAILY OPERATIONS, HOUSEKEEPING, AND MAINTENANCE.  THIS 
PROGRAM ALSO REINFORCES NAVY'S LEADERSHIP IN ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP.

3.  ALL SHIPS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM AS AN 
EFFECTIVE MEANS OF PROMOTING INNOVATIVE AND EFFICIENT ENERGY MANAGEMENT WITHIN 
THE NAVY.  THE INTENT IS TO RECOGNIZE ACHIEVEMENTS AT THE UNIT LEVEL.  THE 
THREE CATEGORIES OF AFLOAT UNITS ELIGIBLE FOR TACTICAL ENERGY AWARDS ARE:
    A.  LARGE HULL: CREW SIZE GREATER THAN 400
    B.  MEDIUM HULL: CREW SIZE 250 TO 400
    C.  SMALL HULL: CREW SIZE LESS THAN 250

4.  SHIPBOARD ENERGY CONSERVATION AWARDS ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING
 CRITERIA:
    A.  TOTAL ENERGY SAVED (55 POSSIBLE POINTS):  TOTAL ENERGY SAVED IN FY11 
AS CALCULATED IN BARRELS AND DOLLARS, COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR ENCON BASELINES 
FOR UNDERWAY, NOT UNDERWAY, AND GAINS/LOSSES BY INVENTORY.  THE ENCON 
BASELINES ARE A ROLLING THREE-YEAR AVERAGE WITH A ONE-YEAR LAG, AND ARE BASED 
ON NAVY ENERGY USAGE REPORTING SYSTEM (NEURS) DATA.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE FY11 
BASELINE YEARS ARE FY09, FY08, AND FY07.  SHIPS MAY VIEW ADDITIONAL DETAILS, 
SUCH AS CLASS AVERAGE BASELINE FOR FY11 AND QUARTERLY FUEL REPORTS, AT THE 
ENCON WEBSITE HTTP://WWW.I-ENCON.COM.  SHIPS SHOULD USE THESE FUEL PERFORMANCE 
REPORTS TO DETERMINE TOTAL ENERGY SAVINGS.  PROVIDE A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF 
ACTIONS TAKEN TO ACHIEVE THE SAVINGS IDENTIFIED.  SHIPS MAY USE THE ENCON 
GUIDE AND CHECKLIST POSTED ON THE WEBSITE AS A REFERENCE.  OPERATIONAL SAVINGS 
ACHIEVED BY OPERATING MORE EFFICIENTLY BOTH UNDERWAY AND NOT UNDERWAY ARE 
PRIMARY AWARD CRITERIA.
    B.  COLD IRON ENERGY SAVED (10 POSSIBLE POINTS):  UP TO 10 POINTS WILL BE 
AWARDED FOR DOCKSIDE SHORE POWER (COLD IRON) ENERGY SAVINGS ACHIEVED BY 
REDUCING HOTEL LOAD DEMANDS WHILE OPTIMIZING COLD-IRON SUPPORT.  PROVIDE A 
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ACTIONS TAKEN TO ACHIEVE THE SAVINGS IDENTIFIED.  
SINCE ONLY NAVAL BASE SAN DIEGO HAS  INDIVIDUAL SHIP KW METERING, SHIPS AT 
OTHER LOCATIONS CAN QUALIFY  FOR THE FULL 10 PTS BY DOCUMENTING ENCON ACTIONS 
TAKEN WHILE ON  SHORE POWER AND PROVIDING KW LOAD DATA BEFORE AND AFTER 
INSTITUTING  THESE MEASURES.
    C.  AWARENESS AND TRAINING (25 POSSIBLE POINTS):  ANY SHIP WHOSE CO

SHIPBOARD ENERGY CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE TRAINING (SECAT) SOFTWARE (UP TO 10 
POINTS).
        (2) ATTENDANCE AT ENCON SEMINARS AND WORKSHOPS CONDUCTED VIA VIDEO 
TELETRAINING (VTT), OR ONSITE TRAINING AT MAJOR NAVAL BASES.
 THE VTT SCHEDULE AND ON SITE TRAINING WILL BE POSTED ON THE ENCON WEBSITE.  
(UP TO 15 POINTS:  XO/CHENG ATTENDANCE 10 PTS, MPA/OTHER DEPARTMENT HEAD 3 
PTS, AND OIL KING 2 PTS.)
    D.  INNOVATION (10 POINTS):  ANY NEW IDEAS AND INNOVATIVE FEATURES THAT
