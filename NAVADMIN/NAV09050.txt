RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES REVISED SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT 
BONUS (SRB) AWARD LEVELS FOR ACTIVE COMPONENT AND RESERVE COMPONENT 
FULL TIME SUPPORT (FTS).  THIS NAVADMIN SUPERSEDES NAVADMIN 240/08.  
INCREASED AWARD LEVELS ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND DECREASES ARE 
EFFECTIVE 11 MARCH 2009.  
2.  THE INCREASE IN MOST OF THE ENLISTED NUCLEAR PROGRAM SRB AWARD 
LEVELS ARE IN EFFECT FOR A LIMITED PERIOD.  THESE NEW AWARD LEVELS 
ARE LISTED BELOW IN PARA 13.  THIS IS A UNIQUE REENLISTMENT 
OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR MOST CRITICAL NUCLEAR SKILLS.  THE NUCLEAR 
PROGRAM SRB AWARD LEVELS LISTED IN PARA 13 WILL BE REDUCED TO AT OR 
BELOW THEIR CURRENT LEVELS NO LATER THAN 11 MAY 2009.  A SEPARATE 
NAVADMIN WILL BE RELEASED 30 DAYS PRIOR TO THE REDUCTION TO CONFIRM 
THE SPECIFIC SRB AWARD LEVEL REDUCTIONS FOR THE ENLISTED NUCLEAR 
PROGRAM.  
3.  REF B ANNOUNCED NEW SRB POLICIES ON THE EARLY REENLISTMENT 
WINDOW.  REF C ANNOUNCED CHANGES IN POLICIES ON SHORT TERM 
EXTENSIONS.  THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL POLICY CHANGES OVER THE PAST 
FEW MONTHS AND IT IS IMPERATIVE EVERY SAILOR AND THEIR CHAIN OF 
COMMAND READ AND UNDERSTAND THESE CHANGES AND THE SUBSEQUENT IMPACTS 
TO THEIR CAREER DECISION MAKING OPPORTUNITIES.  THIS WILL REDUCE 
INTERRUPTIONS IN PAY AND HELP MAXIMIZE TIMELINESS OF SRB PROCESSING. 
4.  THE FOLLOWING GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED ON NAVY ENLISTED 
CLASSIFICATION (NEC) SPECIFIC SRB AND LATERAL CONVERSIONS.  
ACCEPTANCE OF AN NEC-SPECIFIC SRB CONTRACT INDICATES AN AGREEMENT 
BETWEEN THE SAILOR AND THE NAVY TO UTILIZE THE SKILLS ATTRIBUTED TO 
THE NEC DURING THE SAILOR'S ENLISTMENT TO MEET FLEET READINESS 
REQUIREMENTS.  IN SUBSEQUENT TOURS, A SAILOR MUST BE WILLING TO BE 
DETAILED DURING THE NORMAL PROJECTED ROTATION DATE WINDOW TO A 
BILLET AVAILABLE WITHIN THE SRB CONTRACTED NEC, CONSISTENT WITH 
SEA-SHORE FLOW REQUIREMENTS.  LATERAL CONVERSIONS MUST FOLLOW REF 
A, PARA 12.D.  LATERAL CONVERSION REQUESTS WILL NOT BE PROCESSED 
MORE THAN NINE MONTHS BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED 
SERVICE (EAOS).  CONVERSIONS TO A RATE WITH A LOWER AWARD LEVEL 
WILL NOT BE APPROVED.
5.  INFORMATION ON INCREASED AND DECREASED AWARD LEVELS. 
    A.  AN ELIGIBLE SAILOR WITH A NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (NPC) 
APPROVED SRB REQUEST WHO HAS NOT YET REENLISTED OR EXECUTED AN SRB 
QUALIFYING EXTENSION, AND WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM A HIGHER AWARD 
LEVEL UNDER THIS PLAN, WILL BE RE-APPROVED USING THE NEW AWARD LEVEL.  
SAILORS SHOULD ALLOW AT LEAST ONE FULL WORKING DAY FOR THE 
REPROGRAMMING OF THE OFFICER PERSONNEL INFORMATION SYSTEM (OPINS) 
WITH THE NEW AWARD LEVELS.  ONCE OPINS IS REPROGRAMMED, THE AFFECTED 
APPROVALS WILL BE UPDATED BY PERS-811 AND NEW APPROVAL MESSAGES WILL 
BE TRANSMITTED TO THE SAILOR'S COMMAND.  ALLOW THREE WORKING DAYS 
FOR THESE NEW MESSAGES TO REACH COMMANDS PRIOR TO CONTACTING THE SRB 
DESK.  THE COMMAND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE SAILOR'S PAY 
ACCOUNT IS UPDATED TO REFLECT THE NEW AMOUNT AND THAT ANY ERRORS IN 
THE PAY SYSTEM ARE CORRECTED AND CLEARED. 
    B.  A SAILOR IN A SKILL LISTED FOR REDUCTION OR TERMINATION OF 
AWARD LEVEL WHO HAS AN APPROVAL MESSAGE OR A PENDING 
PRECERTIFICATION (PRECERT) FOR A REENLISTMENT DATE AFTER 10 MARCH 
2009, MUST RESUBMIT THE REQUEST FOR A NEW REENLISTMENT DATE OF 
10 MARCH 2009 OR EARLIER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE HIGHER AWARD LEVEL 
PROVIDED THEIR EAOS IS NOT LATER THAN 9 MAY 2009 (90 DAYS FOLLOWING 
THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS MESSAGE AS DESCRIBED IN REF B.  THIS EAOS 
RESTRICTION, I.E., EAOS MUST BE ON OR BEFORE 9 MAY 2009, ALSO 
APPLIES IN THE CASE OF A SAILOR WHOSE SRB AWARD LEVEL HAS DECREASED 
(OR BEEN TERMINATED) BUT WHO DID NOT ALREADY POSSESS AN APPROVAL 
MESSAGE OR PRECERT.  A SAILOR MUST MEET ALL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA 
UNDER PARA 7 FOR THE NEW, OR REQUESTED, DATE OF REENLISTMENT.  THE 
ONLY EXCEPTIONS TO THIS ARE OUTLINED IN REF A, PARA 12.A AND REF B, 
PARA 4.
6.  PERFORM-TO-SERVE (PTS) REQUIREMENTS.  AN SRB REQUEST FOR A 
SAILOR WHO REQUIRES PTS APPROVAL MUST BE SUBMITTED AFTER THE SAILOR 
HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY NOTIFIED OF PTS APPROVAL.  THE STATUS OF PTS 
APPROVAL MAY BE VIEWED THROUGH OPINS IN THE ESTIMATED DATE OF LOSS 
TO NAVY (EDLN) FIELD OF THE I31 SCREEN.
7.  REENLISTMENT PROCEDURES.  SAILORS MAY REQUEST TO REENLIST EARLY 
FOR SRB SO LONG AS THEIR EAOS IS WITHIN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND 
THEIR HARD EAOS IS NOT LATER THAN 90 DAYS FROM THE REQUESTED DATE OF 
REENLISTMENT.  SEE REF A, PARA 12 AND REF B, PARA 4 FOR EXCEPTIONS 
TO THIS POLICY.  OTHER POLICIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES IN REF 
A AND THE DEFENSE JOINT MILITARY PAY SYSTEM (DJMS) PROCEDURES 
TRAINING GUIDE REMAIN IN EFFECT.  IT IS RECOMMENDED SAILORS REENLIST 
AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THEIR EAOS TO PRESERVE THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF 
THEIR SRB PAYMENT.  BECAUSE SRB IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF 
MONTHS FOR WHICH A SAILOR REENLISTS BEYOND THEIR CURRENT EAOS, 
REENLISTING EARLY REDUCES THE SRB PAYMENT.
8.  OBLIGATE SERVICE TO TRAIN (OTT) AND THEN REENLIST.  SEE REF A, 
PARA 12.E. FOR OTT GUIDANCE.  REQUESTS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED TO 
PERS-811 VIA NAVPERS 1306/7, ENLISTED PERSONNEL ACTION REQUEST.  A COPY 
OF THE AUTHORIZATION MESSAGE SHOULD BE b  RETAINED IN THE FIELD SERVICE 
JACKET OR BY THE SAILOR UNTIL THE SRB REENLISTMENT ON GRADUATION DAY 
FROM THE COURSE OF INSTRUCTION.  USE CODE 1CC FOR OTT SRB REQUESTS IN 
OPINS.
9.  COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES.
    A.  COMMANDS MUST SUBMIT SRB REQUESTS VIA OPINS 35-120 DAYS IN 
ADVANCE OF THE SAILORS EAOS OR REENLISTMENT DATE TO ENSURE THE 
APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL MESSAGE WILL REACH THE SAILOR'S COMMAND AND 
THE DEFENSE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING SERVICE (DFAS) BEFORE THE 
REENLISTMENT DATE.  TIMELINESS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE THE APPROVED 
PRECERT NOTIFIES THE DJMS OF THE SAILOR'S INTENT TO REENLIST, 
PREVENTS INTERRUPTION OF PAY, AND ENSURES THE INITIAL SRB PAYMENT 
POSTS TO THE SAILOR'S ACCOUNT.  ANY CHANGES TO THE APPROVAL MAY 
CAUSE ERRORS AND SLOW PAYMENTS.  AS A RESULT, CHANGES SHOULD BE 
PREVENTED.  REQUESTS SUBMITTED LESS THAN 35 DAYS PRIOR TO THE 
REENLISTMENT DATE MAY BE REJECTED.  SAILORS MUST HAVE APPROVED 
PRECERTS BEFORE REENLISTING, THOUGH THEY MAY WAIT UNTIL THEIR EAOS 
TO REENLIST.  THE SERVICING PERSONNEL OFFICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
VERIFYING THE REENLISTMENT, POSTING THE CONTRACT AND RELEASING THE 
FIRST PAYMENT.
    B.  COMMANDS INITIATING SRB PRECERTS MUST ENSURE ALL OF THE DATA 
INCLUDED IN THE PRECERT REQUEST IS CORRECT AND THE SAILOR IS 
ELIGIBLE TO REENLIST FOR THE REQUESTED SRB.  THE SRB REQUEST SHALL 
NOT BE ENTERED INTO OPINS UNTIL THE COMMANDING OFFICER HAS APPROVED 
THE REENLISTMENT REQUEST.
    C.  A SAILOR WITH AN APPROVED PRECERT WHO DOES NOT REENLIST ON 
THE DATE OR FOR THE TERM SPECIFIED ON THE PRECERT MESSAGE MUST HAVE 
THEIR COMMAND CONTACT PERS-811D TO INITIATE A REENLISTMENT 
CANCELLATION TO AVOID PLACING THE SAILOR IN AN OVERPAID STATUS.
10.  CANCELLATION OF INOPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  ANY SAILOR MAY REQUEST 
TO CANCEL UP TO 24 MONTHS OF AN INOPERATIVE EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT 
PROVIDED PARA A AND B BELOW ARE MET:
    A.  CANCELLATION OF THE EXTENSION IS AUTHORIZED BY PERS-811 
BEFORE IT BECOMES OPERATIVE.
    B.  THE SAILOR IMMEDIATELY REENLISTS FOR AT LEAST 24 MONTHS 
BEYOND THE EXTENDED EAOS, DAY-FOR-DAY.  
    C.  ALL INOPERATIVE EXTENSIONS NOT CANCELLED BY PERS-811 WILL 
COUNT AGAINST THE CALCULATION OF A SAILOR'S SRB AWARD UNLESS THE 
REENLISTMENT IS FOR GREATER THAN THE PERIOD OF THE INOPERATIVE 
EXTENSION PLUS 24 MONTHS DAY-FOR-DAY.  A SAILOR WITH A 24-MONTH 
INOPERATIVE EXTENSION WHO EXECUTES A FOUR-YEAR REENLISTMENT ON, NOT 
BEFORE OR AFTER, THE EAOS WILL RECEIVE 48 MONTHS WORTH OF SRB.
    D.  IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO CANCEL AN INOPERATIVE EXTENSION OF 24 
MONTHS OR LESS, PROVIDED THE REENLISTMENT MEETS THE 24 MONTHS DAY-
FOR-DAY RULE.
    E.   EXTENSIONS FOR GREATER THAN 24 MONTHS MAY NOT BE CANCELLED. 
EXTENSIONS EXECUTED FOR ENLISTMENT BONUSES AND NAVY CASH WILL NOT BE 
CANCELLED.
11.  PRECERT REQUIREMENTS.  THE FOLLOWING ARE REQUIRED WHEN 
SUBMITTING PRECERT REQUESTS:
    A.  TO VALIDATE AN INOPERATIVE EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT AND 
EXPEDITE PROCESSING OF AN SRB REQUEST, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN THE 
REMARKS PARAGRAPH OF THE REQUEST:  TERM, NARRATIVE REASON, AUTHORITY, 
AND EXECUTION DATE OF ALL INOPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  FAILURE TO VERIFY 
EXTENSIONS MAY CAUSE PROCESSING DELAYS AND RESULT IN REJECTION OF 
THE REQUEST OR AN APPROVAL AT A LOWER AMOUNT.
    B.  A CONDITIONAL EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT (ANY EXTENSION LESS 
THAN 24 MONTHS) MUST MEET THE REASONS AND TERMS SPECIFIED IN REF A 
AND MILPERSMAN 1160-040 AND REF C, AND MUST BE APPROVED BY PERS-811.  
SAILORS MUST OBTAIN AN APPROVAL FOR EXTENSION FROM PERS-811 IN ORDER 
TO MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF SRB ELIGIBILITY.
    C.  PERSONNEL IN A CLOSED LOOP NEC CAN REENLIST BY THE NEC ONLY.
12.  LITTORAL COMBAT SHIP (LCS) GUIDANCE.  SAILORS ASSIGNED TO LCS 
PLATFORMS OR WITH ORDERS TO AN LCS PLATFORM WHO POSSESS AN NEC 
SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED FOR LCS ASSIGNMENT (I.E., HYBRID SAILORS) ARE 
AUTHORIZED TO REENLIST FOR THE MORE LUCRATIVE SRB- ELIGIBLE NEC, 
REGARDLESS OF ASSIGNED RATING.
13.  REVISED AWARD PLAN.
    A.  A "-" SYMBOL PRECEDING AN AWARD LEVEL INDICATES A DECREASE 
TO THAT AWARD AND/OR CEILING LEVEL FOR THAT SPECIFIC ZONE.  A "+" 
SYMBOL PRECEDING AN AWARD LEVEL FOR A SPECIFIC ZONE OR PRECEDING A 
RATING INDICATES AN INCREASE TO THAT AWARD LEVEL AND/OR CEILING FOR 
THAT SPECIFIC ZONE OR THE ADDITION OF THE RATING TO THE SRB AWARD 
PLAN.
    B.  THE FOLLOWING RATINGS AND NECS ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR 
CONTINUED WARFIGHTING EFFORT.  COMMUNITY MANAGERS ARE FOCUSED ON 
PROVIDING SAILORS THE APPROPRIATE INCENTIVE TO RETAIN THE RIGHT 
INDIVIDUALS WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS AND ESSENTIAL FLEET AND LEADERSHIP 
EXPERIENCE.
