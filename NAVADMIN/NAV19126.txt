SUBJ/DISESTABLISHMENT OF ACTIVE COMPONENT AVIATION OPERATIONS DESIGNATOR 6320 
LIMITED DUTY OFFICERS//

REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/14DEC09//

AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1420.1B, ENLISTED TO OFFICER COMMISSIONING PROGRAMS 
APPLICATION ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces suspension of the Active Component Aviation 
Operations (AVOPS) designator (6320) limited duty officer
(LDO) accessions as planned in the officer sustainment initiative (OSI).  The 
AVOPS designator (6320) will be disestablished after the current inventory 
reaches zero through natural attrition.

2.  As part of OSI, recent billet reviews confirmed that the majority of 
technical AVOPS officer workloads are conducted by junior officers and are 
repetitive in nature.  There is an overlap of AVOPS LDO and AVOPS chief 
warrant officer (CWO) skill sets and there is no sustainable career path to 
control grades.  Based on this review and in line with reference (a), the 
Navy will suspend AVOPS LDO accessions beginning with the Fiscal Year (FY) 
2020 (calendar year 2019) In-Service Procurement Board.

3.  As part of the phased execution of OSI,  the current AVOPS LDO eligible 
population will transition into a more sustainable AVOPS CWO applicant pool 
that meets the technical demands of the Fleet.
Beginning in FY-20, the phasing of AVOPS LDO billets to AVOPS (7320) CWO will 
commence.  Future promotion zone projections will be used to determine the 
pace of phasing of lieutenant commander, commander and captain billets in 
order to preserve similar promotion opportunities for remaining AVOPS LDOs.  
A list of frequently asked questions can be found at MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning.

4.  Point of contact is CAPT Edward Callahan, LDO/CWO Community Manager, at 
(901) 874-3042/DSN 882 or via e-mail at edward.l.callahan(at)navy.mil.

5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.

6.  Released by Vice Admiral John B. Nowell, Jr, N1.//
