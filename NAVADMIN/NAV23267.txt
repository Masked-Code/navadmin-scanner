SUBJ/MILITARY JUSTICE REFORM TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR LEADERSHIP// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces training requirements for leaders across the 
Fleet regarding the military justice reforms required by the Fiscal Year 2022 
and Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Acts. 
 
2.  These military justice reforms fundamentally transform the manner that 
the Navy has historically accomplished the military justice mission.  The 
role of command leadership, in particular, will change.  For the continued 
efficient and fair administration of the military justice system, leadership 
knowledge of 
these reforms is essential.  All Navy Leaders must complete training 
regarding military justice reforms by 22 December 2023.  Leaders who must 
complete training include: 
 
   a.  Convening Authorities (Special and General courts-martial) 
   b.  Commanding Officers 
   c.  Executive Officers 
   d.  Command Master Chiefs 
 
3.  Leaders are directed to receive training from their servicing Staff Judge 
Advocate, or, in the absence of an assigned Staff Judge Advocate, the 
supporting Region Legal Service Office.  This training will cover an 
introduction to the new Office of Special Trial Counsel, the commander's 
changing role in courts-martial, updated victim rights and reporting 
requirements, sentencing reforms, and changes to the processing of sexual 
harassment complaints. 
 
4.  Questions about training should be brought to your servicing Staff Judge 
Advocate or supporting Region Legal Service Office. 
 
5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded.
