GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS MESSAGE ANNOUNCES IMPLEMENTATION OF AN
INVOLUNTARY MOBILIZATION DEFERMENT PROGRAM FOR NAVY VETERANS, AND
OTHER SERVICE VETERANS, OFFICER AND ENLISTED, WHO AFFILIATE WITH THE
NAVY RESERVE.  THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR (GWOT) HAS LED TO INCREASED
PERSTEMPO AND OPTEMPO ACROSS THE FORCE.  BECAUSE OF ONGOING RESERVE
COMPONENT (RC) SUPPORT OF GWOT AND EFFORTS TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE
CONTINUUM OF SERVICE, WE MUST RECOGNIZE THE SERVICE OF SAILORS WHO
ELECT TO CONTINUE SERVING AS A MEMBER OF THE NAVY RESERVE.  REF A
REQUIRES THAT MEMBERS OF THE READY RESERVE RECALLED TO ACTIVE DUTY
RECEIVE FAIR TREATMENT, BASED UPON LENGTH AND NATURE OF PREVIOUS
SERVICE, FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES, AND EMPLOYMENT INTERESTS.
POSTPONING THE POSSIBILITY OF AN IMMEDIATE MOBILIZATION UPON
AFFILIATION TO THE NAVY RESERVE WILL AFFORD SAILORS GREATER
STABILITY AS THEY TRANSITION FROM ACTIVE COMPONENT (AC) TO RC.
2.  PROGRAM GUIDANCE:
    A.  EFFECTIVE 1 MAY 06, OFFICERS AND ENLISTED PERSONNEL WHO
AFFILIATE WITH THE NAVY RESERVE WITHIN 6 MONTHS OF RELEASE FROM
ACTIVE DUTY QUALIFY FOR AND MAY REQUEST A 12 MONTH DEFERMENT FROM
INVOLUNTARY MOBILIZATION, COMMENCING ON THE DATE THEY AFFILIATE WITH
THE NAVY RESERVE IF THEY WERE DEPLOYED DURING THEIR LAST YEAR OF
ACTIVE SERVICE.  ACTIVE DUTY COMMANDS WILL EXECUTE PAGE 13 ENTRIES
FOR SEPARATING PERSONNEL (OFFICER AND ENLISTED) VERIFYING DEPLOYMENT
IN THE LAST YEAR OF ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE.  COPIES OF THE PAGE 13
ENTRY WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE SEPARATING MEMBER AND THE ISSUING
COMMAND WILL RETAIN A COPY FOR 6 MONTHS FOLLOWING MEMBER'S EAOS OR
DATE OF RESIGNATION.
    B.  COMMANDER, NAVY RESERVE FORCES COMMAND (CNRFC) IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR PERSONNEL TRACKING, UNIT/BILLET ASSIGNMENT AND
MANPOWER AVAILABILITY STATUS (MAS) CODE UPDATES.
        (1) AFFILIATES WHO REQUEST DEFERMENT FROM INVOLUNTARY
MOBILIZATION WILL BE ASSIGNED AN AS1 MAS CODE BY THE GAINING NAVY
OPERATIONAL SUPPORT CENTER (NOSC) UPON AFFILIATION.  THE AS1 MAS
CODE IS DESIGNATED AS DEFERRED FROM INVOLUNTARY MOBILIZATION AND
WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR ONE YEAR FROM DATE OF AFFILIATION.
        (2) AFFILIATES NOT DESIRING DEFERMENT FROM INVOLUNTARY
MOBILIZATION (REGARDLESS OF WHEN THEY STATE THEIR DESIRE) OR WHO
HAVE COMPLETED THEIR ONE YEAR DEFERMENT WILL BE ASSIGNED A MAS CODE
THAT CORRECTLY REFLECTS THEIR MOBILIZATION AVAILABILITY (I.E., VOL,
AAP, TNPQ, ETC.).
    C.  PERSONNEL ASSIGNED THE AS1 MAS CODE ARE DEFERRED FROM
INVOLUNTARY MOBILIZATION UNDER CURRENT MOBILIZATION AUTHORITY FOR
OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM/OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM.  AS WITH ALL
MEMBERS OF THE NAVY RESERVE, THEY ARE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN
SATISFACTORY PARTICIPATION STANDARDS AS OUTLINED IN REFS A AND B.
    D.  INDIVIDUALS MUST REMAIN IN GOOD STANDING AS A SELECTED
RESERVIST.  FAILURE TO FULFILL SELECTED RESERVIST REQUIREMENTS WILL
RESULT IN TERMINATION OF THE DEFERMENT STATUS, AND THE INDIVIDUAL
WILL BE ASSIGNED A MAS CODE TO ACCURATELY REFLECT THEIR CURRENT
MOBILIZATION STATUS.
    E.  CNRFC RETAINS THE RIGHT TO AMEND THIS PROGRAM AS NECESSARY
TO MEET MOBILIZATION REQUIREMENTS.
