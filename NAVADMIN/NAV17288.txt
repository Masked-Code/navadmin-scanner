RMKS/1.  References (a) and (b) are cancelled.

2.  We are in a growing Navy.  This requires more people, at a time when we 
are still working our way back to desired sea duty manning levels, and when 
the competition for talent is especially keen.  We will certainly recruit and 
train many more Sailors to help meet these demands, but that will not be 
enough.

3.  Retention of every capable Sailor will be critical to the operational 
readiness of the Navy.  Therefore all early out programs and minimum service 
requirement waiver programs are cancelled.  Service commitments such as 
enlistment contracts, service obligations for accepting promotions, bonuses, 
education, etc., are expected to be fulfilled.

4.  Service members experiencing difficulty in fulfilling obligated service 
requirements are encouraged to work with their chains of command and 
detailers to examine available alternatives to complete their obligation, to 
include reassignments to other duties for humanitarian reasons, in line with 
reference (c).

5.  It has been decades since the last period of major personnel growth in 
our Navy.  You will see many additional policy changes in the coming weeks 
and months to set us on the right course.  However, the most important tool 
we have is deckplate leadership and its ability to influence retention.  The 
Navy is counting on each of you.

6.  Released by VADM R. P. Burke, N1.//
