RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a) and outlines the General 
Military Training (GMT) requirements for FY-18 to include guidance for Navy 
Civilian Mandatory Training.

2.  Vision for GMT and Navy Civilian Mandatory Training.  To the greatest 
extent possible, commanders should conduct training using discussions led by 
command and deckplate leaders.  This concept of leader-led training puts 
training back in the hands of Sailors, enabling a powerful and personal focus 
on integrity, accountability, and character through an interactive learning 
dialog.  We are seeking to eliminate the passive, impersonal, and ineffective 
approaches to training that were often inherent in legacy computer- based 
training products.  Some mandatory topics have specific requirements for 
completion which deviate from this general guidance.  In those cases, the 
requirements are specifically stated on the GMT webpage or Department of the 
Navy (DON) Office of Civilian Human Resources (OCHR) Portal.

3.  GMT requirements.  (Military Only)
    a.  The following is a complete list of mandatory GMT. Commanders are 
responsible for certification of training completion. There is no requirement 
to log accomplishment of GMT training in Fleet Training Management and 
Planning System or Total Workforce Management Services.  However, commands 
are encouraged to keep local records of training completion.

        (1) Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Awareness*
        (2) Equal Opportunity/Sexual Harassment/Grievance Procedures
        (3) Suicide Prevention
        (4) Antiterrorism Level 1 Awareness
        (5) Counterintelligence Awareness and Reporting
        (6) Combating Trafficking in Persons
        (7) Cyber Awareness Challenge (computer-based only)
        (8) Operations Security
        (9) DON Annual Privacy Training
        (10) Records Management

        *The complete standardized content of the SAPR course should be given 
face-to-face in a classroom environment.
    b.  Based on need, commands may choose to include optional GMT topics.  A 
list of optional topics and associated training material are available on the 
GMT webpage.

4.  Navy Civilian Mandatory Training.  The official list of mandatory 
training for Navy civilians and supervisors of Navy civilians (both military 
and civilian) is maintained by DON OCHR at
https://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs/MRA/DONHR/Training/Pages/Mandato
ry-Training.aspx.  References (b) and (c) germane.  Many of the Navy civilian 
mandatory training topics can be completed in combined military-civilian 
training sessions, if desired.  The GMT webpage lists the mandatory training 
topics that can be conducted in combined sessions.

5.  Additional information
    a.  GMT webpage.  The Navy GMT webpage is a comprehensive source of 
training materials and information for GMT.  To access the GMTwebpage go to 
My Navy Portal (MNP) at https://my.navy.mil.  Once logged in to MNP, select 
the Professional Resources drop down menu, then select General Skills 
Training, and then select GMT from the navigation menu on the left to access 
the Navy GMT page.
    b.  Command and deckplate leader discussions (Military and Navy 
Civilians).  Command and deckplate leader discussions may be conducted at 
quarters, all-hands calls, or divisional training, etc. For these 
discussions, printable training materials provide an outline for the conduct 
of training and serve as springboards to elicit discussion to the point that 
the leader is satisfied that the learning objectives are understood.  It is 
not the intent for commands to create new training lesson plans to support 
the accomplishment of GMT.  Printable training materials are available for 
military or civilians on the GMT webpage.
    c.  GMT Calendar.  A notional schedule for GMT completion is provided on 
the GMT webpage for the convenience of commands. Commands are responsible for 
assigning and completing mandatory GMT during the fiscal year, and they 
should develop a GMT schedule that makes sense based on their unique command 
requirements.
    d.  The point of contact for GMT questions or feedback is Mr. Mark 
Oberley, NETC N522, who can be reached at (850)452-4884 or via e-mail at 
gmt.distribution(at)navy.mil.  The point of contact for Navy civilian 
training questions is Ms. Nalo Washington, OPNAV N1C, who can be reached at 
(703)604-0324 or via e-mail at nalo.washington(at)navy.mil.

6.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or 30 September 
2018, whichever occurs first.
