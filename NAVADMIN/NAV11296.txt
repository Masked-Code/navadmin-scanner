RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE FY-11 FLIGHT HOUR VERIFICATION PROCESS 
FOR CONDITIONAL AVIATION CAREER INCENTIVE PAY (ACIP) AND HAZARDOUS DUTY 
INCENTIVE PAY (HDIP) FOR FLYING PROGRAMS.  THIS  PROCESS ENABLES THE NAVY TO 
ACCURATELY COMPENSATE OFFICERS FOR FREQUENT AND REGULAR PERFORMANCE OF 
OPERATIONAL FLYING DUTY.  PER REF A,  COMMANDING OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO 
TRACK AND REPORT FLIGHT HOURS FOR  CONDITIONAL ACIP AND HDIP FOR FLYING 
RECIPIENTS.  THIS VERIFICATION CERTIFIES  THAT THE FY-11 MINIMUM FLIGHT HOUR 
REQUIREMENT WAS MET BY ALL FLYING RECIPIENTS ELIGIBLE FOR CONDITIONAL ACIP AND 
HDIP.

2.  CONDITIONAL ACIP MAY BE PAID TO THOSE AERONAUTICALLY DESIGNATED OFFICERS 
IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES:
    A.  AEROMEDICAL OFFICERS.

SERVICE) REQUIRED BY COMPETENT ORDERS TO PARTICIPATE IN REGULAR AND  FREQUENT 
AERIAL FLIGHTS AS CREW OR NON-CREW MEMBERS.  HDIP FOR FLYING  ELIGIBILITY 
REQUIRES A NON-AERONAUTICALLY DESIGNATED OFFICER TO BE UNDER ORDERS  TO DUTY 
IN A FLYING STATUS AS A TECHNICAL OBSERVER (DIFTECH).  AN  AERONAUTICALLY 
DESIGNATED FLAG OFFICER MUST BE UNDER ORDERS TO DIFOPS TO MAINTAIN  HDIP FOR 
FLYING ELIGIBILITY.  ALL MUST FLY THE MINIMUM HOURS PRESCRIBED IN REF  A.
