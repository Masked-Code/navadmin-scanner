RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the outlines for General Military Training 
(GMT) requirements for Fiscal Year (FY-20).  The Navy has minimized the 
number of mandatory GMT training topics to empower commanders with the 
ability to decide what training their personnel should receive and how often 
they should receive it.  Commanding Officers should review the Command 
Discretion GMT list to determine the frequency and method of additional 
training appropriate for their command.

2.  FY-20 Mandatory GMT Requirements
    a.  Mandatory GMT is training that must be completed by all military 
personnel during the FY

    c.  Personnel with less than 3 years of time-in-service must also 
complete Antiterrorism Level 1 training.  For personnel with greater than 3 
years of time-in-service, Antiterrorism Level 1 periodicity is now a 
triennial requirement and will be mandated for all hands in FY-22.
    d.  Commands may now elect to complete Cyber Awareness Challenge training 
using instructor-led and/or computer-based methods.

3.  FY-20 Command Discretion GMT

following topics at their discretion:
        (1) Alcohol, Drugs and Tobacco Awareness
        (2) Combating Trafficking in Persons
        (3) Domestic Violence Prevention and Reporting
        (4) Electromagnetic Warfare
        (5) Energy Policy

but is required at career touchpoints, in line with reference (b).
