RMKS/1.  This message announces establishment of the Navy Identity Management
(IdM) program and outlines direction for incremental changes to the way we 
disseminate information about our personnel.

2.  We are operating in an environment in which our adversaries work 
tirelessly to gain competitive advantage by accessing operational and 
proprietary information on our ships, submarines, aircraft, installations, 
business processes and our most important asset, our people.  Recognizing 
this, we must adapt how we access, store and share information to effectively 
deny our adversaries this opportunity and advantage.  Today’s operating 
environment requires us to consider all potential threats to our Sailors 
including social media, cyber hacking and other exploitive behavior.  We are 
no longer operating in an environment threatened only by traditional weapons 
such as warships and missiles.

3.  Effective immediately:
    a.  The Navy will establish an IdM program of record to provide Sailors 
the education, training and tools necessary to protect and deny unauthorized 
and inadvertent access to critical information, while balancing our desire to 
maintain transparency within the Navy and with the American people.
    b.  Dissemination practices for active and reserve component enlisted 
advancements and officer promotions, program selections and command 
assignments will be scrutinized and modified, where appropriate.  Current 
practices will continue with the ultimate goal to move all personnel 
communications and transactions to a multi-factor authentication protected, 
secure domain.
    c.  In advance of these changes, Sailors are strongly encouraged to 
review reference (b) to ensure personal online activity, behavior and 
security settings align with Operations Security requirements.  Know who you 
are following, know who follows you and think carefully before posting on 
social media.  Reference (b) can be found at
https://www.navy.mil/ah_online/OPSEC/docs/Policy/Navy_Social_Media_Handbook_2
019.pdf.

4.  These are the first steps.  IdM training will be implemented to teach our 
Sailors and families how to operate smartly in the online battlespace.  We 
are committed to protecting our Sailors and families in every domain.  More 
information on the Navy IdM program will be made available in the next few 
months on the Navy IDM site currently being developed.

5.  Point of contact is Mr. Geoff Tokajer, Identity Management program 
Director (OPNAV N17), who can be reached at (703) 317-7203/DSN 664 or via 
e-mail at geoffrey.tokajer(at)navy.mil.

6.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.

7.  Released by Vice Admiral John B. Nowell, Jr, N1.//
