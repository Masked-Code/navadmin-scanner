SUBJ/OFFICER JOINT PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENT//

REF/A/DOC/TITLE 10, U.S. CODE//

AMPN/REF A IS TITLE 10 CHAPTER 107, PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES CHANGES TO THE NAVY?S PROFESSIONAL MILITARY 
EDUCATION (PME) PROGRAM.  THE NAVY?S PME PROGRAM DEVELOPS AND ENABLES 
RESILIENT AND ADAPTABLE LEADERS TO MEET CHALLENGES AT THE TACTICAL, 
OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC LEVELS OF WAR.  IT PROVIDES A BROAD, COMMON 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE NAVY AND ITS FULL CAPABILITIES TO PREPARE SAILORS TO 
EFFECTIVELY PERFORM MISSIONS ACROSS A FULL SPECTRUM OF NAVAL AND JOINT 
MILITARY OPERATIONS.  JOINT PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION (JPME) IS 
INCORPORATED INTO THE NAVY?S PME PROGRAM.  TIMELY COMPLETION OF JPME IS A KEY 
CONSIDERATION IN IDENTIFYING OUR FUTURE LEADERS.  ACCORDINGLY, DELIBERATE 
CAREER PLANNING IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE OUR OFFICERS CAN COMPLETE PME AND JPME 
CONSISTENT WITH THEIR CAREER GOALS.

2.  RECENT CHANGES IN LAW, REFERENCE A, HAVE AUTHORIZED INSTRUCTION OF JPME 
PHASE II AT SENIOR-LEVEL SERVICE COLLEGES (SLSC) AND EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, 
MADE COMPLETION OF JPME PHASE I A PREREQUISITE FOR SLSC ATTENDANCE.

3.  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF (CJCS) MAY GRANT LIMITED 
EXCEPTIONS TO THE PREREQUISITE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS UNDER EXCEPTIONAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES.  CJCS MUST BE SATISFIED THAT AN OFFICER SELECTED TO RECEIVE 
THIS EXCEPTION HAS KNOWLEDGE OF JOINT MATTERS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE PHASE I 
CURRICULUM TO MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED FOR ENTRY INTO PHASE 
II INSTRUCTION WITHOUT FIRST COMPLETING PHASE I INSTRUCTION.  NO MORE THAN 10 
PERCENT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OFFICERS SELECTED TO ATTEND THE JOINT FORCES 
STAFF COLLEGE OR A SLSC MAY DO SO UNDER SUCH AN EXCEPTION.  THE EXCEPTION IS 
FOR SEQUENCING OF JPME PHASES ONLY AND DOES NOT REMOVE THE EDUCATIONAL 
REQUIREMENT FOR COMPLETION OF JPME PHASE I AND PHASE II FOR JOINT QUALIFIED 
OFFICER (JQO) DESIGNATION.

4.  JPME PHASE I IS OFFERED AT OR THROUGH SERVICE INTERMEDIATE-LEVEL COLLEGES 
(ILC).  JPME PHASE II IS OFFERED AT SLSC AND THE JOINT FORCES STAFF COLLEGE.  
SINGLE-PHASE JPME FULLY SATISFIES EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR JQO IS OFFERED 
AT NATIONAL WAR COLLEGE, THE INDUSTRIAL COLLEGE OF THE ARMED FORCES (ICAF), 
AND THE JOINT ADVANCED WARFIGHTING SCHOOL (JAWS).

5.  COMPLETING PME IN RESIDENCE AT THE NAVAL WAR COLLEGE (NWC) REMAINS THE 
MOST PREFERRED MEANS TO ACCOMPLISH NAVY-SPECIFIC PME AND JPME PHASE I.  
RESIDENT PROGRAMS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE AT THE OTHER SERVICES' WAR COLLEGES AND 
MANY INTERNATIONAL WAR COLLEGES.

6.  SINCE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR EVERY OFFICER TO ATTEND A RESIDENT PROGRAM, A 
VARIETY OF OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR COMPLETION OF PME AND JPME PHASE I VIA 
DISTANCE LEARNING.  NWC DISTANCE EDUCATION PROGRAMS ALLOW OFFICERS TO EARN A 
NWC INTERMEDIATE LEVEL SERVICE COLLEGE DIPLOMA, AND COMPLETE NAVY-SPECIFIC PME 
AND JPME PHASE I.  INFORMATION MAY BE FOUND AT THE NWC COLLEGE OF DISTANCE 
EDUCATION WEBSITE, HTTP://WWW.NWC.NAVY.MIL/DEPARTMENTS---COLLEGES/COLLEGE-OF-
DISTANCE-EDUCATION.ASPX.

7.  NAVY OFFICERS MAY ALSO ENROLL IN OTHER SERVICE DISTANCE LEARNING PROGRAMS 
WHERE THEY WILL RECEIVE OTHER SERVICE-SPECIFIC PME AND JPME PHASE I.  AIR 
FORCE PROGRAM INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND AT THE AIR COMMAND AND STAFF COLLEGE 
WEBSITE, HTTP://WWWACSC.AU.AF.MIL/DISTANCE-LEARNING.ASP.  MARINE CORPS PROGRAM 
INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND AT 
HTTP://WWW.TECOM.USMC.MIL/CCE/PROGRAMS/PME/CSC.ASP.  ARMY PROGRAM INFORMATION 
CAN BE FOUND AT HTTP://USACAC.ARMY.MIL/CAC2/CGSC/DDE/SISTERSVC.ASP.

8.  FOR OFFICERS UNABLE TO COMPLETE JPME PHASE I PRIOR TO THEIR COMMUNITY'S 
COMMANDER COMMAND SCREENING BOARD, A TEMPORARY DEFERRAL PROCESS ALLOWS 
SELECTION FOR COMMAND, IF OTHERWISE QUALIFIED.  HOWEVER, THOSE OFFICERS MAY 
NOT ASSUME COMMANDER COMMAND UNTIL JPME PHASE I IS COMPLETE.

9.  OFFICERS SHOULD COLLABORATE WITH THEIR DETAILERS TO PLAN FOR COMPLETION OF 
JPME CONSISTENT WITH THEIR CAREER GOALS.  ADDITIONAL JOINT OFFICER MANAGEMENT 
INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND AT HTTP://WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/OFFICER/JOINTOFFICER.

10.  POINT OF CONTACT IS LCDR MONICA R. FARR, OPNAV N153, AT (703) 614-
9564/DSN 224 OR EMAIL AT MONICA.FARR(AT)NAVY.MIL.
