INFORMATION 
 
RMKS/1. This NAVADMIN issues guidance for mishap and hazard reporting 
information in Risk Management Information system (RMI). RMI is a single 
program of record to improve Navy and Marine Corps safety management. 
Reference (a) defines the RMI program of record and is endorsed by the 
Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Energy, Installations and Environment 
(ASN EI&E).  By capturing and analyzing Safety Incident Reporting data in a 
single location, the RMI initiative facilitates a safety environment 
for Navy and Marine Corps personnel and enables the enterprise to preserve 
combat readiness and save lives. 
 
2. Background. 
     a. RMI consolidates existing legacy and core safety programs, risk 
management systems, applications, and data. This consolidation of 
previously disparate, parochial systems is a tangible example of us - as a 
naval force - Getting Real, and Getting Better. 
RMI's Streamlined Incident Reporting (SIR) provides a baseline of classes of 
mishaps, hazard reports (HAZREPs) and near misses, and it will provide the 
basis for analysis and trending to improve safety and risk management. RMI 
SIR is a single, integrated system for reporting aviation, afloat, ground, 
and motor vehicle mishaps and is compliant with Department of Defense (DOD) 
safety business rules. RMI SIR synthesizes incident report data into useful 
products for improving risk and safety conditions, and it vastly expands the 
capabilities for safety professionals and leadership to identify trends and 
produce analyses that lead to recommendations and mishap prevention. 
     b. RMI will also enable improved safety reporting efficiency by reducing 
the amount of time DON users spend entering or reentering safety data into a 
system. RMI SIR is a web-enabled, role-based mishap reporting and analysis 
system that is accessible worldwide with a Common Access Card (CAC). RMI SIR 
uses a proven Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) web application customized for 
the Navy and Marine Corps that builds upon the Air Force Safety Automated 
System (AFSAS) platform. 
 
3. Policy. All commands are directed to use RMI SIR Module as the sole 
program of record to submit mishap and hazard report information no later 
than 1 January 2023 with the exception of NAVFAC commands. NAVFAC commands 
will transition to RMI SIR reporting NLT 1 March 2023. After these dates, 
Commands must cease reporting mishaps in the Enterprise Safety Application 
Management System (ESAMS). 
 
3. System integration with ESAMS. 
     a. RMI is a one-stop shop for mishap reporting that will back feed 
mishap information into ESAMS to enable program support in ESAMS while it 
remains online for Safety Program Management (SPM). RMI SIR will feed mishap 
information to ESAMS daily for commands who are current users of ESAMS or 
commands that have not opted out of the ESAMS feed. This automatic back feed 
will allow ESAMS users to continue to use the other modules 
within ESAMS that rely on mishap information. 
     b. This shift to RMI SIR for all mishap and hazard reporting is the next 
     step in the phased transition to RMI for all reporting and SPM 
functions. Future NAVADMINs will provide the timeline for the eventual shift 
of SPM functions into RMI.
