RMKS/1.  Pursuant to reference (a), this NAVADMIN announces United States 
Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) implementation of rapid on-site COVID-19 
testing capability at Baltimore and Seattle Patriot Express (PE) Aerial Ports 
of Embarkation (APOE), operated by Air Mobility Command (AMC).  The dynamic 
nature of the COVID-19 pandemic required the implementation of measures to 
mitigate the risk of
COVID-19 impacts to PE flights departing continental United States (CONUS).

2.  Any Sailor and/or family member(s) executing PCS travel that tests 
positive for COVID-19 while going through rapid on-site testing at a PE APOE 
will do the following:
    a.  Execute Restriction of Movement (ROM) Procedures:
USTRANSCOM/AMC will take immediate responsibility for any Sailor and/or 
family member(s) executing PCS travel that tests positive for
COVID-19 while going through rapid on-site testing at a PE APOE, to
include:  medical, lodging, pet services, meals and transportation support at 
nearby military installations or participating lodging sites.  While in ROM, 
travelers will adhere to AMC guidance.  If a member of a family unit tests 
positive, the entire family unit must commence ROM.  Travelers may not 
proceed separately.
    b.  Contact the MyNavy Career Center (MNCC), available 24/7, by phone at 
1-833-330-MNCC (6622) or email at askmncc@navy.mil.  Ensure good contact 
information is provided to the servicing MNCC agent.
The servicing MNCC agent will take appropriate action to notify the detailer 
of the Sailor and Navy Passenger Transportation Office
(NAVPTO) and provide contact information of the Sailor provided upon initial 
notification.  The detailer of the Sailor and NAVPTO agent will contact the 
Sailor to discuss orders modification (ORDMOD) and to rebook future travel.
    c.  ROM Expenses:  The ORDMOD will ensure per diem is available and 
reimbursable for qualified expenses incurred during the ROM period.  A Sailor 
may elect to use his/her Government Travel Credit Card (GTCC) to pay for 
qualified expenses incurred during the ROM period.  Alternatively, a Sailor 
with or without a GTCC may request a travel advance by contacting MNCC.
    d.  Securing from ROM Procedures:  Once a Sailor/family member meets the 
requirements to return to work in accordance with Bureau of Medicine and 
Surgery (BUMED) return to work guidance, as reflected in paragraph 7.d of 
reference (b) and follow-on versions of the Standardized Operational Guidance 
(in conjunction with any medical provider guidance), they may continue 
execution of their orders.

3.  Contact the MNCC with any questions, issues or to provide feedback at 
833-330-MNCC/6622 or via e-mail at askMNCC(at)navy.mil.
