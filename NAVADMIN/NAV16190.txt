COPY).  REF C IS NAVADMIN 284/15, SEA SHORE FLOW ENLISTED CAREER PATHS
UPDATES FOR NUCLEAR-TRAINED ENLISTED PERSONNEL.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces updates to sea shore flow (SSF) enlisted 
career paths as established in reference (a) and revised in reference (b).  
Reference (c) remains the governing SSF policy for nuclear-trained enlisted 
personnel.

2.  SSF is the personnel policy that assigns sea and shore duty tour lengths 
for each enlisted rating as listed in paragraph 6 below.  In accordance with 
reference (a), SSF replaced sea shore rotation (SSR) as the enlisted tour 
length policy in 2008.  Reference (b) updated reference (a) in 2012 for 
conventional ratings and reference (c) updated nuclear-trained-ratings in 
2015.
    a.  Taking into account unique sea and shore duty billet structure for 
each enlisted rating, tour lengths are determined using the sea shore flow 
model with inputs from rating experts (i.e., enlisted community managers), 
detailers and major stakeholders such as U.S. Fleet Forces, Commander, 
Pacific Fleet, type commanders, Commander Navy Installation Command, and 
resource sponsors.
    b.  Summary of changes from the 2012 NAVADMIN includes:
        - 42 ratings will have no change to current tour lengths;
        - 13 ratings have increased time on sea duty;
        - 10 ratings have decreased time on sea duty;
        - 5 AW ratings broken out separately with decreased time on sea duty;
        - IT rating converts from inside/outside United States (INUS/OUTUS) 
to sea/shore;
        - MAs will serve a Dependent Restricted (type 3) duty in addition to 
their first and/or second OUTUS/sea tour;
        - STGs with 5 year contracts added to T+X program;
        - T+X ratings adjusted based on projected initial time to train;
        - Change to notes for PR, CT, MA and T+X ratings;  and
        - Nuclear power-trained ratings refer to reference (c).

3.  For ease of reference, the SSF enlisted career paths announced in this 
message apply to all active component conventional ratings, including those 
with no changes from reference (b).  Nuclear power-trained personnel should 
refer to reference (c) for tour length information.  Full time support 
personnel should refer to the SSR policy that remains in effect.

4.  Commander, Navy Personnel Command may adjust projected rotation dates 
(PRD) to reflect the tour lengths listed in paragraph 6 based on length of 
tour remaining and the needs of the Navy.
    a.  In order to minimize turbulence in personnel planning, Sailors who 
have current PRDs within 12 months of the release of this NAVADMIN will not 
have their PRDs adjusted, unless requested by the Sailor via the Enlisted
Personnel Action Request (NAVPERS 1306/7) or the units commanding officer 
based on unit readiness needs.
     b.  Sailors with current PRDs beyond 12 months, and whose new adjusted 
PRD places them inside the normal 7 to 9 months detailing window, will be 
handled on a case-by-case basis.  Actual rotation dates may vary by up to six 
months based on projected manning levels and availability of Sailors rotating 
to fill projected vacant billets, refer to MILPERSMAN 1306-104.
     c.  A larger than normal number of Sailors joined the Navy in 2013 and 
therefore will be entering their rotation windows and/or approaching the end 
of their initial contracts within the next few years.  Over the same time 
period, additional units will be entering the Optimal Fleet Response Plan 
(OFRP), requiring higher manning standards than non-OFRP units.  This may 
require greater than normal use of the +/- six month detailing window in 
addition to other manning actions to ensure operational units remain properly 
manned during that time period.

5.  SSF enlisted career paths are defined in paragraph 6 below and should be 
read in 11 columns:
    a.  RATING - enlisted community used for determining applicable SSF 
career path.  To determine tour lengths for those ratings that compress at 
the E8 and E9 pay grades (AB, AF, AV, CU, EQ, UC, GS), refer to the third and 
fourth sea tour length columns (Sea3, Sea4) of the appropriate feeder rating.

Compressed Feeder:
Rating      Ratings        Notes
AB          ABE, ABF, ABH compress at E9
AF          AD, AME, AM   compress at E9; AME compresses to
AM at E8
AV          AE, AT         compress at E9
CU          BU, EA, SW     compress at E8
EQ          CM, EO         compress at E9
UC          CE, UT         compress at E9
GS          GSE, GSM       compress at E8
    b.  SEA1 - Amount of time in months a Sailor will be assigned to their 
first sea tour.  Depending on sea duty availability, Sailors may be assigned 
to a shore tour immediately following initial training and prior to their 
first sea tour.  In this case, Sailors will be assigned to shore duty for 24 
to 36 months depending on the rating and location or type of duty prior to 
commencing their first sea tour.
    c.  SHR1 - Amount of time in months a Sailor will be assigned to shore 
duty after completing their first sea tour.
    d.  SEA2 - Amount of time in months a Sailor will be assigned to their 
second sea tour.
    e.  SHR2 - Amount of time in months a Sailor will be assigned to shore 
duty after completing their second sea tour.
    f.  SEA3 - Amount of time in months a Sailor will be assigned to their 
third sea tour.
    g.  SHR3 - Amount of time in months a Sailor will be assigned to shore 
duty after completing their third sea tour.
    h.  SEA4 - Amount of time in months a sailor will be assigned to their 
fourth sea tour.
    i.  SHR4 - amount of time in months a Sailor will be assigned to shore 
duty after completing their fourth sea tour.
    j.  SEA/SHR - Sea tours and shore tours for Sailors that have completed 
four sea tours will be 36 months at sea followed by 36 months ashore until 
retirement.
    k.  See paragraph 7 for additional notes regarding SSF career paths.

7.  Communities:
    a.  Sea-Intensive Communities.  Ratings that have SSF career paths set to 
the maximum sea tour lengths allowed by policy, resulting in 216 months or 18 
years on sea duty over a 30-year career, are considered sea-intensive.  T+X 
ratings (reference note J below) that are assigned the maximum sea tour 
lengths following the first sea tour are also considered sea-intensive.  
Maximum assigned sea tour lengths for these communities will not exceed 60 
months for Sailors with less than 20 years of service (YoS) and 48 months for 
Sailors with more than 20 YoS.  Shore tour lengths between sea tours will be 
set to 36 months long.  Manning conditions at sea may require sea tour 
extensions or shore tour curtailments to ensure all sea duty billets are 
properly filled.  Sailors in sea-intensive communities are also subject to 
the +/- six month detailing window as described in paragraph 2 above; 
however, voluntary extension of sea duty or curtailment of shore duty remains 
the preferred method to ensure proper sea duty manning.  Sailors are advised 
to contact their community manager or detailer for information on or 
availability of incentives such as Sea Duty Incentive Pay or Voluntary Sea 
Duty Program for volunteering to serve additional time on sea duty.
    b.  INUS/OUTUS Communities.  Sailors in INUS/OUTUS communities have SSF 
career paths based on a flow between INUS and OUTUS duty assignments.  
Assignment to sea and/or OUTUS duty (types 2, 3, 4, and 6) will be considered 
sea tours for SSF purposes.  Assignment to INUS shore duty (type 1) will be 
considered shore tours for SSF purposes.
        (1) LNs have a limited number of sea duty (type 2 and 4) billets 
available for assignment.  Tour assignments for the LN community will be 
based on INUS/OUTUS career paths, as described above.
        (2) MAs that successfully complete a full tour at a Surface Weapons 
Force Atlantic or Strategic Weapons Facility will be granted OUTUS/sea duty 
credit for SSF purposes only and will be eligible for INUS/shore duty 
assignment upon completion.  MAs will be required to complete a dependent 
restricted OUTUS/sea tour assignment type 3 (Andros Island Bahamas, Bahrain, 
Diego Garcia, Poland, Romania, Souda Bay) in addition to their first and/or 
second OUTUS/sea tour rotation.  Senior MAs may be required to complete a 
dependent restricted OUTUS/sea tour assignment in addition to their third 
OUTUS/sea tour rotation.  Hawaii is considered INUS/shore duty (type 1).  
Sailors are encouraged to contact their community manager or detailer for 
additional career path information.
        (3) RPs have a limited number of sea duty billets available for 
assignment.  Tour assignments for the RP community will be based on 
INUS/OUTUS career paths as described above.
    c.  Shore-Intensive Communities.  Sailors in shore-intensive communities 
do not have career paths defined by SSF and can expect to spend more than 
half their career on shore duty assignments.  Sailors are encouraged to 
contact their community manager or detailer for specific career path 
information.
        (1) ACs shore tour lengths at particular shore unit identification 
code are dependent upon the tower classification and the time frame required 
to become qualified for tower operations.  Sailors in the AC community can 
expect to serve more than half their careers in operational support tours 
ashore.  Every effort will be made to ensure Sailors are afforded equitable 
opportunities to serve at sea to enhance career progression.  Sailors are 
encouraged to contact their community manager or detailers for additional 
career path information.
        (2) MUs will be assigned to one of the various Navy bands throughout 
their career.  Assignment by fit of skill and/or Navy enlisted classification 
(NEC) predominates and minimum tour lengths apply.  MUs can expect at least 
one tour assignment to an OUTUS band during their career and are required to 
maintain world-wide assignability.  Though classified type 1 shore duty, all 
INUS bands are subject to frequent and extensive temporary assigned duty 
within their area of responsibility (AOR), and are considered deployable 
units.  OUTUS bands are subject to shipboard and ground-based deployment 
within their AOR and require operational duty screening.  MUs are encouraged 
to contact their community manager or detailer for additional career path
information.
    d.  Mid-Career Transition Community.  Sailors in mid-career transition 
communities will have completed at least one sea tour while in their initial 
community.  Prior to applying for transition, Sailors should fully understand 
career path information, including possible sea tour lengths.
        (1) Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Operators transition to the LCAC 
community after completing at least two sea tours in their initial community.  
LCAC operators can expect sea tour lengths of 48 months after transitioning 
to the LCAC community.  Due to the limited availability of LCAC operator 
shore duty billets, Sailors in the LCAC community may be assigned to their 
initial community for shore duty.
        (2) NC - Navy Career Counselors transition to the NC community after 
completing at least one sea tour in their initial community.  Sailors can 
expect sea tour lengths of up to 48 months.  The length of the first sea tour 
as an NC will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending upon the 
individual's sea tour experience and transition timing.
        (3) NCCR - Navy Career Counselors, Career Recruiters have no sea duty 
billets and will be assigned as required.
        (4) CMD - Command master chiefs and command senior chiefs have a 
unique career path and will be detailed to leadership milestone billets as 
appropriate.
    e.  Naval Special Warfare Community.  The Naval Special Warfare (NSW) 
community is a sea-intensive community.  Due to the unique nature of the 
special warfare mission, Sailors in the elite communities of NSW Operator and 
NSW Combatant Crewman should expect to serve back-to-back sea tours prior to 
assignment ashore.  Sailors in these communities can expect their initial 
back-to-back sea tours to be within the same geographic location, contingent 
upon the needs of the Navy and NSW.
    f.  Medical Community.  SSF enlisted career paths for the HM community 
are dependent upon the Sailor's specific NEC or specialty.  HMs can expect 
36-month sea tours followed by 36-month shore tours except for those with 
NECs that are shore-intensive.  Those with operational intensive
NECs can expect longer sea tour lengths.  HMs are encouraged to contact their 
community manager or detailer for additional career path information or visit
http://www.public.navy.mil/Bupers-npc/enlisted/Community/medical for specific 
community management information.
    g.  Nuclear Power Community.  Nuclear power trained Sailors should refer 
to reference (c) for SSF enlisted career path information.
    h.  Cryptologic Community.  Due to the unique nature and specific skill 
sets required by Sailors in the CT community, career paths are defined by 
INUS/OUTUS vice SSF, with the exception of the Cryptologic Technician 
Maintenance (CTM) and Cryptologic Technician Technical (CTT) ratings.  
Sailors can expect to serve on various tours OUTUS and/or on sea duty (types 
2, 3, 4, and 6) during their career.  Due to the unique characteristics of 
the Cryptologic community, Sailors in the CT communities are encouraged to 
contact their community manager or detailers for additional career path 
information.  INUS/OUTUS rotations for specific CT ratings are listed below 
and are dependent upon billet availability and emerging needs of the Navy:
        (1) CTI E1 - E9  1 INUS/1 OUTUS (SEA) ** See note
H.4
        (2) CTN E1 - E5  2 INUS/1 OUTUS (SEA)
                E6 - E7  2 INUS/1 OUTUS (SEA) ** See note
H.8
                E8 - E9  3 INUS/1 OUTUS (SEA)
        (3) CTR E1 - E4  1 INUS/2 OUTUS (SEA)
                E5 - E8  1 INUS/1 OUTUS (SEA) ** See note
H.7
                E9       2 INUS/1 OUTUS (SEA)
        (4) CTIs will be detailed according to billet and relief 
availability.  CTIs are assigned according to the varying demand for the 
unique linguistic skills they possess.  The INUS/OUTUS assignment flow is 
only a recommended flow and need not be followed to maintain career 
progression.
        (5) CTMs will be detailed according to billet and relief 
availability.  Most permanent change of station (PCS) afloat tours will be 48 
months to include CTM skills 9225, and 9298 CTM 9229 (sub duty) requires 60-
month sea duty obligation following initial skills training.  CTM E7 and 
above may have multiple back to back shore rotations.
        (6) CTT AEF (6 year) skills 173x and 1702, first sea tour will be 48 
months due to length of initial training; all subsequent sea tours will be 36 
months.
        (7) CTRs are assigned according to the varying demand of the unique 
technical skills they possess.  Due to the nature of CTR skill 9149, Sailors 
are assigned based entirely upon billet availability and not INUS/OUTUS flow.
Hawaii shore billets are considered OUTUS (sea).  All rotations will be 36 
months in length with exception of the following:  E7 personnel not serving a 
DoD-mandated tour will serve 48 months in an OUTUS sea billet and E8 
personnel will serve 48 months INUS.  The INUS/OUTUS assignment flow will be 
followed when available billets support; however, based on emerging needs and 
NEC requirements, this flow need not be followed to maintain career 
progression.
        (8) CTNs will be detailed according to billet and relief 
availability.  CTNs are assigned according to the varying demand for the 
unique cyber skills they possess. Hawaii shore billets are considered OUTUS 
(sea).  All rotations will be 36 months in length and the INUS/OUTUS 
assignment flow is only a recommended flow and need not be followed to 
maintain career progression.
    i.  Seabee Community.  Basic Underwater Construction Technician, NEC 
5932, initial sea tour in the underwater construction teams will be 60 months 
regardless of previous accumulated sea duty.  Advanced Underwater 
Construction Technician, NEC 5931, subsequent sea/shore tour lengths will be 
36/36 months.  Master Underwater Construction Technician, NEC 5933, sea/shore 
tour lengths will be 36/36 months. Mobile Utilities Support Equipment 
Technician, NEC 5633, initial sea tour will be 36 months regardless of 
previous accumulated sea duty.  Subsequent sea/shore tour lengths will be 
36/36 months.
    j.  T+X Rating.  The T+X accession pilot increases the enlistment length 
and initial active obligation enlisted obligation active service(EAOS) for 
designated pilot ratings from four to five years, and sets a Sailor's 
prescribed sea tour (PST) and PRD to approximately align with EAOS, as 
follows:
        (1) The first four pilot ratings (AO, EMSW, GSE and QM) participated 
in the pilot beginning in FY-11; Sailors in those four ratings who shipped to 
Recruit Training Command (RTC) beginning in October 2010 and before October 
2012 had the PST/PRD for their initial sea tour set to their EAOS month.  
Sailors in those four ratings who shipped beginning in October 2012 will have 
their initial sea tour PST/PRD set to the SEA1 tour shown for their rating in 
paragraph 6.
        (2) The next 11 pilot ratings (ABE, ABF, ABH, AME, GSM, BM, OS, SH, 
MMA, MMW, and CSSS) were added to the pilot beginning in FY-13; Sailors in 
those 11 ratings who shipped to RTC beginning in October 2012 will also have 
their initial sea tour PST/PRD set to the SEA1 tour shown for their rating in 
paragraph 6.
        (3) Three more pilot ratings (CS, LS, LSSS) were added in FY-14; 
Sailors in those 3 ratings who shipped to RTC beginning in October 2013 will 
have their initial sea tour PST/PRD set to the SEA1 tour shown for their 
rating in paragraph 6.
        (4) The next pilot rating (STG) was added in FY-17; Sailors in the 
STG rating with a 5 year enlistment who ship to RTC beginning in October 2016 
will have their initial sea tour PST/PRD set to 50 months.  Sailors with a 4 
year enlistment who ship before October 2016, or a 6 year enlistment who ship 
in any month, will have their initial sea tour set to the SEA1 tour shown for 
their rating in paragraph 6.
    k.  Other Ratings.
        (1) ITs will be converting from an INUS/OUTUS rotation construct to 
sea/shore.  Sea duty credit will be granted for type 2, 3, or 4 duty 
assignments.  Type 6 duty will be considered sea duty until the member 
executes PCS orders.  ITs currently on type 6 duty will rotate to type 1 duty 
upon completion.  Any subsequent type 6 duty assignment will be considered 
shore duty for the IT rating.
        (2) MT supervisors (E7 and above) can expect 30 month sea and shore 
duty tours within the same fleet concentration area after completing their 
second shore tour. This is designed to improve geographic stability and 
enhance career opportunities for senior MTs.  MTs that execute a funded PCS 
move can expect a 36-month tour following the funded PCS move.
        (3) PR - Aircrew Survival Equipmentmen have very few E8 and E9 sea 
duty billets.  As a result, E8 and E9 PRs do not follow SSF career paths and 
will be assigned to sea duty as needed or available.
