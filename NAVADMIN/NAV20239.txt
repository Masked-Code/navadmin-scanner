RMKS/1.  Reference (a) provides guidance regarding an exception to policy on 
small arms training, qualification, and sustainment criteria and Navy 
Security Force annual sustainment training requirements, as described in 
references (b) through (g).  Due to the continued impacts from COVID-19, this

The expiration time period for the required small arms annual qualification 
and semi-annual sustainment criteria in reference (b) and the Navy Security

through 30 November 2020.  Commanders shall continue small arms live-fire 
qualification and sustainment criteria, and Navy Security Force sustainment 
training, as applicable, to the extent possible within COVID-19 restrictions 
and guidance.  Personnel returning to live-fire training shall be prioritized 
based on their expiration of qualifications, to minimize or eliminate the 
need for further extensions.

be extended through 30 November 2020; however, qualifications will not exceed

directed to continue providing firearms safety and weapons familiarization, 
to include use of simulators for sustainment if available, within COVID-19 
restrictions and guidance.
    b.  Per reference (b), for deployed afloat commands, qualification
    /sustainment may be extended until two months after return to homeport.
    c.  Per reference (g), extensions for live-fire small arms qualifications
    will not exceed a period of 24-months since the last live-fire
    qualification.  Personnel who do not complete live-fire small arms
    qualifications within a period of 24-months will not be authorized to be 
armed.
    d.  Navy Physical Security and Law Enforcement Program.  Per reference 
(d), table 6-1, Navy Security Force personnel are required to complete annual
    sustainment training requirements.  Reference (f) provides annual 
sustainment training requirements for Navy Civilian Guard Force and Auxiliary 
Security Forces.  The expiration time period for all Navy Security Force and 
armed sentry watch-stander annual sustainment training requirements may be 
extended through 30 November 2020, with the exception of training in 
paragraph 4 of this message.

4.  Required continued training:  Commanders will ensure all personnel who 
are armed will continue to complete Use of Force, awareness, and 
acknowledgement training, stated in references (d), (e) and (g).

5.  Exception to this NAVADMIN will be submitted to OPNAV N4 via the 
appropriate chain of command.  Exceptions for reference (g), regarding the
