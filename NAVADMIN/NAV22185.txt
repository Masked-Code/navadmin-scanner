AMPN/REF A IS MILPERSMAN 1306-964, RECRUITING DUTY.// 
 
RMKS/1.  The purpose of this NAVADMIN is to solicit applications for 
the official Navy Esports Team, Goats and Glory, by Commander, Navy 
Recruiting Command (CNRC).  The Navy Esports Team significantly 
contributes to the multi-faceted outreach campaign of CNRC by 
engaging with prospective Sailors online and at gaming venues. 
Centennials are moving into digital spaces for most of their content 
consumption and social interactions, and the Esports domain is one 
of the most popular and vibrant online arenas to date.  Connecting 
and attracting the best talent requires the Navy to be in the same 
spaces where those future Sailors reside. 
 
2.  The qualifications and requirements to become a team member are 
identical to those needed for recruiting duty.  Reference (a) 
provides further details. 
 
3.  Applicants will be screened for ability, team fit, and 
recruiting duty.  Upon approval, they will receive 3-year orders to 
CNRC, Millington, TN.  Selected team members will receive recruiting 
training at Navy Recruiter Orientation Unit (NORU), Pensacola, FL, 
en route to CNRC.  The intent of NORU training will be to further 
develop communication skills and to ensure team members understand 
the types of information sought by those inquiring about service in 
the Navy. 
 
4.  Goats and Glory team members operate at the Navy Esports 
facility, which is specifically designed for the team to practice, 
stream, and compete.  Team members will develop a routine streaming 
cadence, encouraging followers and viewers to interact with the 
members and outreach content, and compete against high schools and 
colleges across the country. 
 
5.  Team member applications will be accepted via a portal on the 
CNRC website only during a specified timeframe.  The next submission 
window is 1 September through 1 October 2022.
