RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces procedures for the completion of
E-6 evaluations in advance of the Cycle 250 Navy-Wide Advancement Exam.  Due 
to the extension of the E-6 evaluation deadline, outlined in reference (a), 
it is important that commands meet the established deadline and do not delay 
in entering the relevant reporting seniors cumulative average (RSCA) 
performance mark average (PMA) evaluation data into the enlisted advancement 
worksheet (EAW).  Commands must complete all E-6 evaluations with required 
signatures and process them no later than 15 December 2020.

2.  Upon receipt of the completed evaluation, it is imperative that the 
command educational services officer (ESO) upload the evaluations with the 
RSCA value in block 43 and enter applicable RSCA PMA data into the EAW as 
soon as possible.

3.   An EAW system update in November 2020 now mandates the ESO at
the command to validate and finalize Sailor worksheets before forwarding to 
the servicing ESO.

4.  As a reminder Professional Military Knowledge-Eligibility Exam
(PMK-EE) remains a requirement for advancement and all Sailors must have 
their PMK-EE completed by 1 December 2020 in order to be eligible for 
advancement in Cycle 250, in line with reference (b).

5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
