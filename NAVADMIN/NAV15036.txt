RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN is a coordinated Office of the Chief of Naval 
Operations (OPNAV)/Navy Information Dominance Forces (NAVIDFOR) message that 
provides Navy-wide direction regarding the fiscal year 2015 (FY15) cyber 
security (CS) awareness training requirement for all Navy personnel as set 
forth in references (a) through (d).  Proper network discipline is critical 
to maintaining the security and integrity of Navy networks and failure to 
accomplish annual training introduces unnecessary operational risk.

2.  All DON and intelligence community military (per the General Military 
Training Schedule (NAVADMIN 202/14)), civilians, and contractors with access 
to unclassified and secret networks shall satisfy the FY15 training 
requirement by completing one of the following:  Cyber Awareness Challenge 
(CAC) version 2 (v2), CAC Intelligence Community (IC) v2, or IC-Intelligence 
System Security Awareness (ISSA) v5.

3.  The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) requires 
intelligence personnel with access to Joint Worldwide Intelligence 
Communications System or directly supporting the Office of Naval Intelligence 
or Director of Naval Intelligence initiatives to complete either the IC-ISSA 
v5 or CAC IC v2 for the intelligence community to satisfy the FY15 
requirement.

4.  Authorized methods for training delivery:
    a.  Total Workforce Management Service (TWMS), 
https://twms.navy.mil/selfservice/login.asp;
    b.  Navy e-Learning (NEL) via the Navy Knowledge Online (NKO) portal; or
    c.  Other approved training sources, such as general military
    lectures and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Digital
    Video Discs.

5.  Deploying commands shall make every effort to complete the training prior 
to deployment.  Afloat commands with limited bandwidth may access the annual 
training from the ship's Navy e-Learning afloat (AILE) application hosted on 
the Navy Information/Application Product Suite (NIAPS) server, eliminating 
the need to reach back to shore hosted NEL websites.  If the CAC v2, CAC IC 
v2, or IC-ISSA v5 courses are not available via AILE, the ship's NIAPS 
administrator shall update all AILE Learning Management System Publication 
and the weekly Navy Training Management and Planning System Afloat (NAFL) 
amendments.  Commands may order CS awareness training compact discs from DISA 
via, http://iasecontent.disa.mil/eta/products_order_form.pdf.

6.  CS awareness training is an individual responsibility.  However, 
Commanders and Commanding Officers are accountable for 100 percent completion 
of training.  Echelon II command information assurance managers (IAM) and 
training officers are responsible for tracking and reporting compliance to 
meet annual Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements.

7.  Command training officers shall validate training via the TWMS or fleet 
training management and planning system, 
https://ntmpsweb.ncdc.navy.mil/Fltmps/ authoritative database.  Training 
officers shall manually input training not completed via TWMS, NEL, or AILE.  
Report discrepancies to the Navy Training Management Planning System 
Operational Support office at ntmps.support(AT)navy.mil or 1-866-438-2898/DSN 
922-1867.

8.  All personnel shall complete training by 31 July 2015 in order to 
facilitate annual FISMA reporting requirements.  Echelon II training officers 
are responsible for rolling up data for their respective area of 
responsibility.  The command IAM shall disable the accounts of users who fail 
to complete training until the training is completed.

9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.

10.  Released by Vice Admiral Ted N. Branch, OPNAV N2N6.
