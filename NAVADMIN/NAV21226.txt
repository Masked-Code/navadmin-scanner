(AERR).// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Advancement Examination Readiness Review 
(AERR) schedule from October 2021 to March 2022. AERR events provide an 
opportunity for selected rating subject matter experts from fleet and shore-
based commands to impact their respective ratings by updating and validating 
the examination question bank.  Selected chief, senior chief and master chief 
petty officers on active duty, full-time support and reservists currently on 
active duty for operational support may take part in the process. AERRs 
enable the Navy to advance the most qualified and rating-knowledgeable 
Sailors. 
 
2.  AERRs are held at Naval Education and Training Professional Development 
Center (NETPDC) Pensacola, FL.  Temporary Duty Travel (TDY) in support of 
AERR events is considered mission critical and is flag officer approved.  All 
costs pertaining to TDY are funded by NETPDC.  All travel will be in line 
with Department of the Navy regulations at the time of the scheduled AERR. 
 
3.  In line with reference (a), and normally no less than 45 days prior to 
the AERR convening date, Type Commanders (TYCOM)/rating sponsors will recruit 
rating fleet subject matter experts (FSMEs), select AERR attendees plus two 
alternate members, and work with NETPDC staff to provide the requested number 
of FSME names and contact information via e-mail to 
NETPDC_AERR_MAILBOX(at)navy.mil with the subject line of *AERR 
Selectees*.  In cases where this NAVADMIN is within 45 days of the AERR 
convening date, coordination with TYCOM/rating sponsors is already in 
progress to ensure appropriate participation is confirmed as soon as 
possible. 
 
4.  The following AERRs are scheduled from October 2021 through March 2022 
and are subject to change.  AERR schedule is in the following format:
