SUBJ/96TH NAVY RESERVE ANNIVERSARY MESSAGE//

RMKS/1.  AS WE CELEBRATE THE 96TH BIRTHDAY OF THE NAVY RESERVE ON
3 MARCH 2011, I EXTEND MY MOST SINCERE GRATITUDE TO A FORCE THAT IS ALWAYS 
READY AND TO THE FAMILIES OF OUR RESERVE COMPONENT SAILORS WHO ENABLE THAT 
SELFLESS SUPPORT.

2.  FROM ITS ESTABLISHMENT ON 3 MARCH 1915, TO CRITICAL OPERATIONS AROUND THE 
WORLD TODAY, THE NAVY RESERVE HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO OUR NATIONAL 
DEFENSE IN EVERY MAJOR CONFLICT.  MORE THAN 5,500 RESERVE COMPONENT SAILORS 
CURRENTLY FILL KEY COMBAT SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS AROUND THE WORLD.  SINCE 11 
SEPTEMBER 2001, NAVY RESERVE SAILORS HAVE CARRIED OUT MORE THAN 63,600 OF OUR 
95,000 INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE ASSIGNMENTS IN AN UNPARALLELED CONTRIBUTION TO THE 
CURRENT FIGHT.

3.  THE NAVY RESERVE IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF AMERICA'S NAVY - A GLOBAL 
FORCE FOR GOOD.  THE SELFLESS DEDICATION OF OUR RESERVE COMPONENT SAILORS 
PROVIDES STRATEGIC FLEXIBILITY AND THE OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES NEEDED TO 
EXECUTE OUR MARITIME STRATEGY.  I THANK EACH OF YOU, YOUR FAMILIES, AND 
SUPPORTING EMPLOYERS FOR CONTINUING TO SERVE OUR NAVY AND NATION WITH HONOR, 
COURAGE, AND COMMITMENT.

4.  ALWAYS, BUT MORESO TODAY, THE NAVY RESERVE IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR 
TOTAL FORCE.  HAPPY 96TH BIRTHDAY!

5.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
