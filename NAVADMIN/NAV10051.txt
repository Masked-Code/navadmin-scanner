SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE, ESRP ZONE D ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ARE 
CHANGING PER PARAGRAPH 6 BELOW.  ESRP ZONE C AND ZONE D MULTIPLES ARE 
CHANGING PER PARAGRAPH 7 BELOW.

AUTHORITY AND HAVE NOT YET REENLISTED AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF 
THIS NAVADMIN PLUS 30 DAYS, WILL STILL BE AUTHORIZED TO REENLIST 
UNDER THEIR CURRENT APPROVAL MESSAGE.  DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVY 
OPERATIONS, (MANPOWER, PERSONNEL, TRAINING AND EDUCATION) POLICY 
DIVISION (N133D) WILL ACT AS THE ESRP PROGRAM MANAGER UNTIL FURTHER

(CSRB) LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE A RETENTION INCENTIVE FOR 
MEMBERS ASSIGNED TO CERTAIN SPECIFIC CRITICAL NAVY ENLISTED 
CLASSIFICATION (NEC) CODES, AS APPROVED BY THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.
    A.  ESRP PROGRAM EXECUTION WILL BE SIMILAR TO THE SELECTIVE 
REENLISTMENT BONUS (SRB) PROGRAM.
    B.  THE ESRP PAYMENT STRUCTURE WILL BE IDENTICAL TO THE
SRB PROGRAM, IN WHICH 50 PERCENT OF THE CONTRACT WILL BE
PAID UPON CONTRACT EXECUTION AND THE REMAINDER PAID IN EQUAL 
INSTALLMENTS ON 1 OCTOBER FOR EACH REMAINING YEAR OF THE ESRP
REENLISTMENT CONTRACT.
    C.  ESRP REENLISTMENT CONTRACTS WILL BE LIMITED TO $100K DUE
TO PROGRAM FISCAL CONSTRAINTS.

PROGRAM.  SAILORS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN ZONE B AND WITHIN 120 DAYS OF 
ENTERING ZONE C ARE ELIGIBLE TO REQUEST ZONE C ESRP FOR A PENDING 
ZONEC REENLISTMENT.
    E.  ESRP REQUESTS FOR PERSONNEL BEING PROCESSED FOR NEC
REMOVAL OR RESTORATION WILL BE HELD IN ABEYANCE PENDING FINAL

SUBMITTED 35-120 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE MEMBER'S DESIRED REENLISTMENT 
DATE TO ENSURE THE APPROVAL MESSAGE CAN BE RELEASED IN A TIMELY
 MANNER.  EXCEPTIONS TO THIS POLICY WILL BE APPROVED BY THE ESRP 
PROGRAM MANAGER ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.
    A.  THE OFFICER PERSONNEL INFORMATION SYSTEM (OPINS) FORCE 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (FORMAN) IS PROGRAMMED TO PROCESS ESRP REENLISTMENT 
REQUESTS AND EMPLOYS THE SAME PROCESS USED TO REQUEST AND APPROVE SRB 
REENLISTMENT REQUESTS.  CAREER COUNSELORS AND PERSONNEL SUPPORT 
DETACHMENTS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROGRAM AND SHOULD USE IT AS THE 
PREFERRED METHOD OF ESRP REQUEST SUBMISSION.  THE ESRP REQUEST TYPE 
IS 3AA FOR SAILORS ON ACTIVE DUTY AND 3BB FOR BROKEN SERVICE REQUESTS. 
IN THE EVENT OPINS IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE COMMAND CAN FAX, EMAIL 
(SCANNED COPY OF REQUEST), OR MAIL THE REQUEST DIRECTLY TO THE ESRP 
PROGRAM MANAGER UTILIZING THE FORMAT FOUND IN THE ESRP POLICY 
MEMORANDUM.  IF OPERATIONAL COMMITMENTS LIMIT THE ABILITY TO SUBMIT 
ESRP APPLICATIONS VIA THIS MANNER, COMMANDS SHOULD SUBMIT A ESRP 
REQUEST VIA MESSAGE THROUGH THEIR IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR IN CHARGE 
(ISIC), WHO CAN SUBMIT THE OPINS REQUEST.  ESRP REQUESTS SENT 
DIRECTLY TO THEESRP PROGRAM MANAGER BY MESSAGE OR MAIL MAY RESULT IN
A PROCESSING DELAY.
    B.  ZONE C SAILORS MUST HAVE A VALID APPLICATION ENTERED IN THE 
PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) SYSTEM TO BE ELIGIBLE TO REENLIST.  THE PTS 
SUBMISSION CAN BE MADE IN PARALLEL WITH THE OPINS REQUEST FOR ESRP.
    C.  A SAILOR MUST BE PREAPPROVED FOR AN ESRP REENLISTMENT.  ESRP 
APPROVAL WILL NOT CURRENTLY NOTIFY THE DEFENSE JOINT MILITARY PAY 
SYSTEM (DJMS) OF THE SAILOR'S INTENT TO REENLIST.  UNTIL DJMS CAN BE 
PROGRAMMED TO ACCEPT ESRP REENLISTMENT PAYMENTS, MANUAL PROCESSING IS
REQUIRED.  PAYMENTS SHOULD POST TO THE SAILOR'S ACCOUNT WITHIN 14 
DAYS FOLLOWING THE DAY THE ESRP PROGRAM MANAGER RECEIVES NOTIFICATION 
OF REENLISTMENT SINCE THE ESRP PROGRAM MANAGER MUST COORDINATE WITH 
THE DEFENSE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING SERVICE (DFAS) FOR EACH MEMBER'S 
PAYMENT.  INITIAL PAYMENT WILL BE AUTHORIZED, AS SOON AS THE CONTRACT 
EXECUTION IS REFLECTED IN THE ENLISTED MASTER FILE (EMF).  IN ORDER 
TO ENSURE PROMPT PAYMENT, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT NEW CONTRACTS ARE 
POSTED TO THE EMF IN A TIMELY MANNER.
    D.  PERSONNEL SUPPORT DETACHMENTS AND COMMANDS SHOULD CONTACT THE
ESRP PROGRAM MANAGER (N133D) VICE DFAS TO RESOLVE ANY PAYMENT ISSUES.
    E.  A SAILOR WITH AN APPROVED PRE-CERTIFICATION, WHO DOES NOT
REENLIST ON THE DATE SPECIFIED IN THE PRE-CERTIFICATION MESSAGE,

AWARD AMOUNT.  A REVISED APPROVAL MESSAGE WILL BE SENT TO THE 
SAILOR'S COMMAND.
