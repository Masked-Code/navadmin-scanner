FAMILY ADVOCACY PROGRAM CASE REVIEW COMMITTEE PROCEDURAL CHANGES.  REF C IS NAVADMIN 
101/11, FAMILY ADVOCACY PROGRAM PILOT PROCESS REVISION FROM A CASE REVIEW COMMITTEE TO 
AN INCIDENT DETERMINATION COMMITTEE AND CLINICAL CASE STAFF MEETING.// 

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN promulgates changes which will be incorporated into a future revision of ref 
(a) and supersedes guidance provided in refs (b) and (c).  These changes take effect immediately.  A copy 
of this message should be filed and retained with ref (a).  Key changes are:
    a.  Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) will no longer participate in the Incident Determination 
Committee (IDC) as a core voting member.
    b.  The command representative will no longer participate in the IDC as a core voting member, but is 
eligible to cast their vote for command-specific cases. 

2.  Fleet and Family Support Center (FFSC) is directed to implement an IDC and Clinical Case Staff 
Meeting (CCSM) model to replace the current Case Review Committee (CRC) model previously used to 
adjudicate domestic and child abuse cases.  The IDC/CCSM model divides administrative and clinical 
Family Advocacy Program (FAP) functions into two separate reviews.

3.  IDC membership will consist of the following core members designated in writing by the committee 
chairman:  
    - installation executive officer (chair)
    - installation command master chief or senior enlisted advisor
    - installation or tenant command staff judge advocate
    - installation security representative
    - Family Advocacy Representative (FAR)
    a.  The local NCIS Special Agent in Charge (SAC) will designate an NCIS agent who will participate in the 
IDC meeting to provide pertinent, case-specific information authorized by the SAC to be made available 
to the IDC.  The NCIS representative will not be a voting member.  In certain cases, NCIS may have to 
consult with civilian or military prosecutors prior to releasing case information to the IDC.
    b.  For FAP cases involving an active-duty service member, the command representative will attend 
IDC meetings.  The command representative shall participate in the case review and may cast a vote for 
the command-specific case only.  It is recommended that only commanding officers, executive officers, 
and command master chiefs participate as command representatives. 

4.  The IDC will make an incident status determination using DoD criteria.  All core voting members or 
their alternates shall attend the IDC.  Completion of mandated web-based training is required prior to 
participation on the IDC.

5.  The IDC will determine whether a case meets or does not meet specified criteria for domestic or child 
abuse.  All cases that meet abuse criteria will be recorded in Navy's central registry and staffed to an 
installation CCSM.  Cases that do not meet abuse criteria will be staffed to the CSSM, referred to 
appropriate services, recorded in the central registry without identifying information, and closed.

6.  The purpose of the CCSM is safety planning, supportive services, clinical treatment, periodic case 
reviews, and case closures.  CCSM attendees will be limited to individuals with clinical/professional 
expertise in domestic and child abuse.  Chair of the CSSM will be the FAR or a tier III clinically privileged 
designee/alternate.

7.  FAP support will begin before the case is presented to the CCSM. 
Specific treatment recommendations for each FAP case will be determined at the CCSM following 
incident status determination.  

8.  Requests for appeal/review of case determinations will be made in writing within 30 days of receipt 
of an IDC decision.  The case will be reviewed at the local IDC or referred to established Commander, 
Navy Installations Command headquarters review team.  

9.  Points of contact are Mrs. Sonia Smith, N135F, at (901) 874- 4355/DSN 882 or via e-mail at 
sonia.smith(at)navy.mil or Ms. Crystal C. Griffen, at (202) 433-4597, or via e-mail at 
crystal.c.griffen(at)navy.mil.
