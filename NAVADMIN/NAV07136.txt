SUBJ/TASK FORCE INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION (TFIA) UPDATE// 
RMKS/1.  LAST OCTOBER, WE BEGAN 
IMPLEMENTING SEVERAL INITIATIVES TO RECOGNIZE SAILORS WHO ARE MAKING 
SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR (GWOT).  SINCE 
THAT TIME, THE TFIA RECEIVED CONTINUOUS, POSITIVE FEEDBACK AND 
SUGGESTIONS FROM ACROSS THE FLEET ON FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS, 
MODIFICATIONS, AND CHANGES TO NAVY S IA PROCESSES.  OVER THE PAST 
SEVERAL WEEKS, TFIA DEVELOPED THIS FEEDBACK INTO APPROVED 
RECOMMENDATIONS TO BETTER RECOGNIZE AND VALUE OUR SAILORS WHO SERVE IN 
IA DUTY.  
THIS NAVADMIN SUMMARIZES THIS RECENT WORK, AND OVER THE COMING WEEKS, 
ADDITIONAL MESSAGES WILL ANNOUNCE SPECIFIC UPDATES AND/ OR NEW 
INITIATIVES INTENDED TO CONTINUE IMPROVING NAVY S IA PROGRAM, RECOGNIZE 
OUR IA SAILORS AND BUILD PREDICTABILITY INTO WHAT IS AN INHERENTLY 
DYNAMIC MISSION.
2.  DISTRIBUTION:  THE DISTRIBUTION RECOGNITION DETAILED IN NAVADMIN
273/06 IS MODIFIED SUCH THAT IA TOURS OVER 270 (VICE 365) DAYS WILL BE 
CONSIDERED EQUIVALENT TO FORWARD DEPLOYED NAVAL FORCES (FDNF) TOURS.
ENLISTED AND OFFICER DETAILERS WILL AFFORD THE SAME PRIORITY AND 
BENEFITS TO IA PERSONNEL SUCH AS COAST SELECTION PREFERENCE AND/OR 
PRIORITY CHOICE OF FOLLOW-ON DUTY ASSIGNMENTS AND LOCATIONS.
3.  ADVANCEMENT:  THE AWARD POINTS TOWARD ADVANCEMENT RECOGNITION 
DETAILED IN NAVADMIN 273/06 AND NAVADMIN 280/06 WILL BE UPDATED TO 
INCLUDE SAILORS WHO HAVE COMPLETED GREATER THAN 90 DAYS (IN AN IA TOUR, 
PCS TOUR, TEMADD, OR IN ANY DUTY
STATUS) IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, HORN OF AFRICA, KUWAIT, GTMO, JOINT TASK 
FORCE 515 (USPACOM), AND JOINT FORCE SPECIAL TASK FORCE-PHILIPPINES
(USPACOM) MISSIONS WILL BE CREDITED TWO ADVANCEMENT POINTS WITH PARENT 
COMMANDS ENDORSEMENT.  A SPECIFIC UPDATE TO NAVADMIN 280/06 WILL BE 
PROMULGATED BY SEPCOR.
4.  PERSONAL READINESS I-STOP:  A PERSONAL READINESS I-STOP BACK TO THE 
PARENT COMMAND WILL BE AUTHORIZED FOR IA S WITH 179 DAY (OR GREATER) 
ORDERS AND 45 DAYS (OR GREATER) IN THEIR TRAINING TRACK.  MEMBERS WILL 
COMPLETE A FINAL PERSONAL READINESS CHECKLIST WHILE THEY ARE ON THIS I-
STOP.
5.  STARTING WITH THE SEP 07 ACTIVE DUTY AND AUG 07 INACTIVE DUTY
(RESERVE) EXAM CYCLES, ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY WILL BE GIVEN TO 
OPERATIONAL COMMANDERS TO ADMINISTER ADVANCEMENT EXAMS IN IRAQ, 
AFGHANISTAN AND THE HORN OF AFRICA, IF CONDITIONS PERMIT.  
EXISTING FLEXIBILITY FOR EARLY, LATE, AND MISSED EXAM CYCLES WILL 
REMAIN IN AFFECT.  A SPECIFIC UPDATE TO NAVADMIN 290/06 WILL BE 
PROMULGATED SEPCOR.
6.  THE PROPOSALS FOR A GWOT-IA BADGE/MEDAL WAS CAREFULLY REVIEWED.  
CURRENT RECOGNITION BY EXISTING MEDALS (E.G., IRAQ CAMPAIGN, 
AFGHANISTAN CAMPAIGN, GWOT EXPEDITIONARY) FOR THOSE SERVING IN COUNTRY 
(INCLUDING
IAS) ARE CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE VITAL CONTRIBUTION 
OUR SAILORS ARE MAKING.  THE CURRENT INDIVIDUAL AWARDS PROCESS IS BEING 
STREAMLINED IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT OUR SAILORS ACHIEVEMENTS ARE 
RECOGNIZED IN A CONSISTENT AND TIMELY MANNER.
7.  WE ARE ALSO MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS MAINSTREAMING GWOT SUPPORT 
BILLETS INTO OUR EXISTING DETAILING PROCESS.  WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL 
MONTHS WE WILL BEGIN ASSIGNING OFFICERS TO JMD-VALIDATED MISSIONS 
THROUGH NORMAL DETAILING CHANNELS (USING PCS ORDERS).  
THIS FIRST STEP IMPROVEMENT IS INTENDED TO ALLOW OUR PEOPLE AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO NORMALIZE A GWOT TOUR WITH OTHER CAREER ASSIGNMENTS, TO 
PROVIDE THEM INCREASED STABILITY AND TO DELIVER MORE NOTIFICATION TIME 
BEFORE A GWOT DEPLOYMENT.  BY MAINSTREAMING GWOT SUPPORT ASSIGNMENTS IN 
THIS MANNER, THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN TODAY S PROCESS (THE CHANCE 
THAT A SAILOR MAY BE ASSIGNED TO AN IA BILLET AT AN INOPPORTUNE TIME IN 
THEIR CAREER) WILL BE REDUCED.  
ADDITIONAL DETAILS OUTLINING THE PROCESS AND ITS PHASED IMPLEMENTATION 
WILL BE TRANSMITTED SOON.
8.  AS MENTIONED IN PREVIOUS TFIA UPDATE NAVADMINS, BALANCING NAVY S 
REQUIREMENTS TO SUPPORT THE GWOT WITH OUR INHERENT DUTY TO TAKE CARE OF 
OUR SAILORS IS CRITICAL.  THE STEPS OUTLINED ABOVE ARE AN ESSENTIAL 
ELEMENT OF MAINTAINING THAT BALANCE AND CONTINUING TO DEMONSTRATE OUR 
NAVY S RECOGNITION OF THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS OUR SAILORS ARE 
MAKING TODAY.  I AM PROUD OF THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE BY OUR SAILORS 
IN THE GWOT MISSION AND THANK EACH OF YOU FOR THE SUPPORT YOU GIVE TO 
THIS EFFORT EVERY DAY.
