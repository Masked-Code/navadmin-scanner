NARR/REF A ESTABLISHED THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY ENERGY CONSERVATION  AWARDS TO 
RECOGNIZE NAVY AND MARINE CORPS ACTIVITIES FOR OUTSTANDING  ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN ENERGY 
CONSERVATION AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT DURING  THE PRECEDING FISCAL YEAR.  REF B IS SECNAV'S

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES CRITERIA FOR THE FY12 SHIPBOARD  ENERGY CONSERVATION 
PORTION OF THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY ENERGY  CONSERVATION AWARDS PROGRAM IAW REF A.  
ALTHOUGH THIS PROGRAM HAS  BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR OVER A DECADE, IT HAS TAKEN ON 
INCREASED  SIGNIFICANCE SINCE 2009, WHEN REF B ANNOUNCED SECNAV'S DEPARTMENT OF  THE 
NAVY ENERGY TARGETS AND ESTABLISHED NEW OVERALL GOALS FOR  ALTERNATIVE ENERGY USE, 
ENERGY CONSERVATION, AND EFFICIENCY.

2.  ENERGY CONSERVATION (ENCON) IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF ENERGY  SECURITY, AND IS ONE OF 
SECNAV'S TOP PRIORITIES, THOUGH THE  NECESSITY FOR A SPARTAN FRUGAL VIEW TO THE USE OF 
OPERATIONAL FUELS  IN WAR IS NOT NEW.  IT DOMINATES THE HISTORY OF MANY OF OUR BATTLES  AT 
SEA AND ON LAND DURING WORLD WAR TWO YET WE NEED LOOK NO FURTHER  THAN THE 
BATTLESFIELDS OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN TO REALIZE OUR  APPETITE FOR FUEL MUST NOT BECOME 
A WEAKNESS IN THE FUTURE.  ENERGY  SECURITY IS THEREFORE RIGHTLY REFLECTED IN EACH OF THE 
CNO'S 21ST  CENTURY TENETS OF THE SAILING DIRECTIONS.  SINCE ENERGY IS A KEY  ENABLER FOR OUR 
WARFIGHTING CAPABILITY, ENCON DIRECTLY SUPPORTS THE  TENET OF WARFIGHTING FIRST.  ENCON 
ALSO PROVIDES THE INDIVIDUAL SHIP  CO AND FLEET COMMANDER AN ADDED COMBAT CAPABILITY, 
ENSURING THAT WE  CAN OPERATE FORWARD FOR A GREATER PERIOD OF TIME.  IN ORDER TO BE  
READY, WE MUST CREATE A WARRIOR CULTURE THAT INCORPORATES JUDICIOUS  ENERGY USAGE INTO 
EVERY PART OF HOW WE OPERATE ON A DAY-TO-DAY  BASIS.  ENCON IS THE FIRST STEP TO ACHIEVE A 
SECURE ENERGY FUTURE  THAT PROMOTE SECNAV'S GOALS WHILE ALIGNING TO THE CNO'S TENETS.

3.  THE ENERGY CONSERVATION AWARDS PROGRAM PROMOTES EXCELLENCE IN  ENERGY 
MANAGEMENT AND ENERGY CONSERVATION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF  THE NAVY.  THESE 
EFFICIENCY EFFORTS ARE INTEGRAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT  OF WARFIGHTING CAPABILITIES THAT 
RESULT IN CHOICES FOR THE  OPERATIONAL COMMANDER.  RECOGNITION WILL BE GIVEN FOR 
OUTSTANDING  LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY MANAGEMENT; INNOVATIONS IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF  
ENERGY EFFICIENCY; AND ENERGY CONSERVING APPROACHES TO TRAINING,  DAILY OPERATIONS, 
HOUSEKEEPING, AND MAINTENANCE.  THIS PROGRAM ALSO  REINFORCES NAVY'S LEADERSHIP IN 
ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP.

4.  ALL SHIPS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM  AS AN EFFECTIVE 
MEANS OF PROMOTING INNOVATIVE AND EFFICIENT ENERGY  MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE NAVY.  THE 
INTENT IS TO RECOGNIZE ACHIEVEMENTS  AT THE UNIT LEVEL.  THE THREE CATEGORIES OF AFLOAT 
UNITS ELIGIBLE  FOR OPERATIONAL ENERGY AWARDS ARE:
    A.  LARGE HULL:  CREW SIZE GREATER THAN 400
    B.  MEDIUM HULL:  CREW SIZE 250 TO 400
    C.  SMALL HULL:  CREW SIZE LESS THAN 250

5.  SHIPBOARD ENERGY CONSERVATION AWARDS ARE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING
 CRITERIA:
    A.  TOTAL ENERGY SAVED (55 POSSIBLE POINTS):  TOTAL ENERGY SAVED  IN FY12 AS CALCULATED IN 
BARRELS AND DOLLARS, COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR  ENCON BASELINES FOR UNDERWAY, NOT 
UNDERWAY, AND GAINS/LOSSES BY  INVENTORY.  THE ENCON BASELINES ARE A ROLLING THREE-YEAR 
AVERAGE  WITH A ONE-YEAR LAG, AND ARE BASED ON NAVY ENERGY USAGE REPORTING  SYSTEM 
(NEURS) DATA.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE FY12 BASELINE YEARS ARE FY11,  FY10, AND FY09.  SHIPS MAY VIEW 
ADDITIONAL DETAILS, SUCH AS CLASS  AVERAGE BASELINE FOR FY12 AND QUARTERLY FUEL REPORTS, 
AT THE ENCON  WEBSITE HTTP://WWW.I-ENCON.COM.  SHIPS SHOULD USE THESE FUEL  PERFORMANCE 
REPORTS TO DETERMINE TOTAL ENERGY SAVINGS AND PROVIDE A  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ACTIONS 
TAKEN TO ACHIEVE THE SAVINGS  IDENTIFIED.  SHIPS MAY USE THE ENCON GUIDE AND CHECKLIST 
POSTED ON  THE WEBSITE AS A REFERENCE.  OPERATIONAL SAVINGS ACHIEVED BY  OPERATING MORE 
EFFICIENTLY BOTH UNDERWAY AND NOT UNDERWAY ARE  PRIMARY AWARD CRITERIA.
    B.  COLD IRON ENERGY SAVED (10 POSSIBLE POINTS):  UP TO 10 POINTS  WILL BE AWARDED FOR 
DOCKSIDE SHORE POWER (COLD IRON) ENERGY SAVINGS  ACHIEVED BY REDUCING HOTEL LOAD 
DEMANDS WHILE OPTIMIZING COLD-IRON  SUPPORT.  PROVIDE A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ACTIONS 
TAKEN TO ACHIEVE  THE SAVINGS IDENTIFIED.  SINCE ONLY NAVAL BASE SAN DIEGO HAS  INDIVIDUAL 
SHIP KW METERING, SHIPS AT OTHER LOCATIONS CAN QUALIFY  FOR THE FULL 10 PTS BY 
DOCUMENTING ENCON ACTIONS TAKEN WHILE ON  SHORE POWER AND PROVIDING KW LOAD DATA 
BEFORE AND AFTER INSTITUTING  THESE MEASURES.
    C.  AWARENESS AND TRAINING (25 POSSIBLE POINTS):  ANY SHIP CO  THAT ATTENDS AN ENCON 
SEMINAR AUTOMATICALLY RECEIVES THE FULL 25  POINTS.  SHIPS MAY ALSO EARN THE FULL 25 POINTS 
THROUGH A  COMBINATION OF:
        (1) DOCUMENTED USE OF ENCON PROGRAM MATERIALS, SUCH AS GUIDES  AND SHIPBOARD 
ENERGY CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE TRAINING (SECAT)  SOFTWARE (UP TO 10 POINTS).
        (2) ATTENDANCE AT ENCON SEMINARS AND WORKSHOPS CONDUCTED VIA  VIDEO TELETRAINING 
(VTT), OR ONSITE TRAINING AT MAJOR NAVAL BASES.
 THE VTT SCHEDULE AND ON SITE TRAINING WILL BE POSTED ON THE ENCON  WEBSITE.  (UP TO 15 
POINTS:  XO/CHENG ATTENDANCE 10 PTS, MPA/OTHER  DEPARTMENT HEAD 3 PTS, AND OIL KING 2 
PTS.)
    D.  INNOVATION (10 POINTS):  ANY NEW IDEAS AND INNOVATIVE  FEATURES THAT MAKE THE 
APPROACH TO ENCON UNIQUE AND/OR ACHIEVE  TECHNICAL OR ECONOMIC BENEFITS, OTHER THAN 
THOSE LISTED IN THE ENCON  GUIDE OR CHECK LIST WILL EARN ADDITIONAL POINTS.  TO BE ELIGIBLE,  
INITIATIVES MUST BE POSTED TO THE NAVY ENERGY LESSONS LEARNED SITE  AT 
HTTPS://WWW.JLLIS.MIL/NAVY/.
    E.  TIE-BREAKERS - IF TWO SHIPS EARN THE SAME NUMBER OF POINTS IN  CATEGORIES A-D, THE FIRST 
TIE-BREAKER GOES TO THE SHIP WITH THE  HIGHER INNOVATION GRADE, SINCE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS 
IN OUR APPROACH TO  ENERGY USAGE WILL BE CRITICAL TO GETTING THE MOST FROM A NEW  
NAVYWIDE ENERGY CULTURE.  IF NECESSARY, THE SECOND TIE-BREAKER WILL QQQQ  GO TO THE SHIP 
WHOSE CO ATTENDED AN ENCON SEMINAR.  LEADERSHIP IN  JUDICIOUSNESS MUST START WITH THE 
COMMANDING OFFICER AND THIS IS A  WAY TO DEMONSTRATE IT.

6.  PER REF C, COMMANDERS SHOULD LOOK TO THOSE COMMANDS NOMINATED AND  SELECTED FOR 
THESE PRESTIGIOUS AWARDS WHEN CONSIDERING  ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR THE ENERGY 
COMPONENT GRADE TO THE BATTLE  EFFICIENCY 'E'.

7.  AWARD SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE TO NAVSEA 05 NLT 15 APR 2013.  NAVSEA
 05 WILL COORDINATE WITH OPNAV N45 AND RECOMMEND AWARD WINNERS VIA  THE CHAIN OF 
COMMAND FOR APPROVAL AND ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SECRETARY  OF THE NAVY.  THE AWARDS 
CEREMONY IS TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR  OCTOBER 2013.  DETAILS AND LOCATION TO BE PROVIDED 
SEPCOR.
