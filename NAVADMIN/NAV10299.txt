NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 287/10, NAVY UNIFORM UPDATE.  REF B IS 343/08, 
UNIFORM UPDATE.  REF C IS NAVADMIN 188/09, NAVY UNIFORM UPDATE.  REF D  
IS US NAVY UNIFORM REGULATIONS.

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN CANCELS REF A, AND PROVIDES CLARIFYING GUIDANCE 
ON THE MANDATORY WEAR DATES OF THE NAVY WORKING UNIFORM (NWU), AS 
ANNOUNCED IN REF B.  THE NWU FACILITATES NAVY LEADERSHIP'S INTENT TO 
STANDARDIZE THE PROFESSIONAL APPEARANCE OF SAILORS WHEN WEARING A 
WORKING UNIFORM ASHORE.  FLEET-WIDE AVAILABILITY OF THE NWU HAS BEEN 
SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVED SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THE ORIGINALLY 
ESTABLISHED MANDATORY WEAR DATE, AND THE NWU WILL NOW BE WORN AS THE 
WORKING UNIFORM ASHORE BY
31 DECEMBER 2010.

2.  CURRENT NWU COMPONENT INVENTORY INDICATES THAT SAILORS HAVE 
PURCHASED  AN AVERAGE OF 1.3 UNIFORMS, WELL BELOW THE FOUR UNIFORMS PER 
SEA BAG WHICH  MOST SAILORS HAVE BEEN PAID TO PROCURE.  SEABAG CONTENT 
AND QUANTITY REQUIREMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED TO ENSURE DEPLOYMENT AND 
MISSION READINESS.

3.  PER REF B, 31 DECEMBER 2010 REMAINS THE DEADLINE FOR SAILORS TO 
HAVE ALL REQUIRED NWU ITEMS.  FOR E1-E9, THAT EQUATES TO FOUR SETS OF 
NWU, AS DESCRIBED IN PARA 6.  OFFICER STANDARDS ARE ADDRESSED IN PARA 
7.

4.  THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTION EXISTS:
FOR THOSE SAILORS WHO COMMENCED RECRUIT TRAINING ANY TIME BETWEEN 1 
OCTOBER
 2007 AND 26 APRIL 2009, THE DEADLINE TO POSSESS FOUR SETS OF NWU IS 30 
JUNE 2013.  THIS FOLLOWS THE LATEST DATE WHEN ALL SAILORS IN THIS 
CATEGORY WILL HAVE RECEIVED FOUR YEARS OF CLOTHING REPLACEMENT 
ALLOWANCE (CRA).
ANNUAL CRA PROVIDES FOR ONE SET OF NWU PER YEAR PLUS A PERCENTAGE OF 
THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF NWU FOOTWEAR AND OUTERWEAR, BASED ON THEIR 
APPLICABLE WEAR LIFE.

5.  PREVIOUSLY, GUIDANCE WAS PROVIDED TO SAILORS TO SAVE THESE ANNUAL 
UNIFORM ALLOWANCE INCREASES FOR THE PURCHASE OF NWU SEABAG 
REQUIREMENTS, IN ORDER TO AVOID ADVERSE IMPACT ON PERSONAL FINANCES AS 
THE MANDATORY WEAR DATE APPROACHES.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT LEADERSHIP 
CONTINUE TO EDUCATE SAILORS TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF 
PROCURING NWU ITEMS WITH THE FUNDS THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED.

6.  BY 31 DECEMBER 2010, COMMANDERS AND COMMANDING OFFICERS SHOULD HAVE 
VERIFIED THAT ALL SAILORS UNDER THEIR COMMAND HAVE THE REQUIRED UNIFORM 
COMPONENTS IN THEIR SEA BAG, APPROPRIATE TO THE LEVEL OF UNIFORM 
ALLOWANCE THAT EACH SAILOR HAS RECEIVED.  FULL NWU COMPONENT 
REQUIREMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
    A.  FOUR NWU BLOUSES AND TROUSERS
    B.  ONE PAIR OF NWU BOOTS
    C.  TWO EIGHT-POINT UTILITY CAPS
    D.  FIVE 100% BLUE COTTON T-SHIRTS
    E.  FIVE PAIRS OF BOOT SOCKS
    F.  ONE MOCK TURTLE NECK SWEATER
    G.  ONE FLEECE LINER
    H.  ONE GORTEX PARKA

7.  REF D ESTABLISHES UNIFORM QUANTITY REQUIREMENTS.  OFFICERS ARE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR BUYING AND MAINTAINING UNIFORMS APPROPRIATE TO THEIR 
ASSIGNED DUTIES, AND AS REQUIRED BY THEIR PRESCRIBING AUTHORITY.  THERE 
IS NO MINIMUM NUMBER OF UNIFORMS REQUIRED TO BE IN THEIR POSSESSION.  
SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF UNIFORM ITEMS SHALL BE PROCURED AND MAINTAINED 
TO ENSURE HIGH STANDARDS OF PERSONAL HYGIENE AND APPEARANCE.

8.  NWU COMPONENTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE VIA NAVY EXCHANGE UNIFORM 
CENTERS.
NAVY EXCHANGE UNIFORM SALES ASSOCIATES ARE AVAILABLE TO ENSURE PROPER 
FIT AND SIZING OF NWU COMPONENTS.

9.  THE NWU OCCASION FOR WEAR, AS DETAILED IN REF C, REMAINS IN EFFECT.

10.  YOUR LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT IN THIS EFFORT IS GREATLY APPRECIATED 
TO ENSURE UNIFORM STANDARDIZATION, MISSION READINESS, AND REDUCTION OF 
EXCESS INVENTORY WHICH COULD IMPEDE FUTURE UNIFORM INITIATIVES.
