INDIVIDUALS, COMMANDS WILL IDENTIFY CANDIDATES IN A SEPARATE ENCLOSURE 
TO THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL.  USE THE SAME FORMAT THAT IS USED FOR

AFGHANISTAN, HORN OF AFRICA CANDIDATES."  IN A COLUMN BESIDE THE 
EXAMINATION SERIAL NUMBER, COMMANDS SHOULD LIST THE MISSED CYCLE(S).  
INCLUDE COPIES OF WORKSHEETS OF MISSED EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE 
PERFORMANCE MARK AVERAGE FOR MISSED EXAMINATIONS.
        (2) EXAMINATION SCORING.  AFTER THE EXAMINATION IS SCORED, 
FINAL MULTIPLE SCORES WILL BE COMPETED AGAINST THE EXAMINATION CYCLE(S) 
MISSED, STARTING WITH THE EARLIEST MISSED CYCLE.  NETPDTC (N321) WILL 
APPLY THE FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE TO THE PREVIOUS (MISSED) EXAMINATION 
CYCLE(S) AND IF THIS SCORE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN ADVANCEMENT, THEN 
NETPDTC (N321) WILL RECORD THE ADJUSTED ADVANCEMENT DATE TO THE 
PREVIOUS CYCLE, ISSUE A RATING CHANGE AUTHORIZATION, AND NOTIFY 
NAVPERSCOM (PERS-48/PERS-3) TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE 
AFFECTED AREAS OF THE SAILOR S SERVICE RECORD.

EXAMINATION CYCLES WILL BE AFFORDED TWO OR MORE MAKE-UP EXAMINATION 
CYCLES. 
FOR EXAMPLE:  A PO2 IS ASSIGNED IA TO IRAQ FOR THE PERIOD DECEMBER 2006 
THROUGH NOVEMBER 2007, THUS MISSING BOTH THE MARCH 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 
2007 EXAMINATIONS.  THAT SAILOR MAY TAKE THE MARCH 2008 PO1 EXAMINATION 
AND HAVE IT COMPETED AGAINST THE MARCH 2007 EXAMINATION (THE FIRST 
EXAMINATION CYCLE MISSED).  IN THE CASE OF A QUALIFYING FINAL MULTIPLE 
SCORE, THE CANDIDATE WILL BE ADVANCED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  IF SCORED 
PNA OR FAIL, THE EXAMINATION WILL THEN BE COMPETED AGAINST THE 
SEPTEMBER 2007 EXAMINATION (THE SECOND CYCLE MISSED).  IN THE CASE OF A 
QUALIFYING FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE, THE CANDIDATE WILL BE ADVANCED AS 
DESCRIBED ABOVE.  IF THE SECOND EXAMINATION IS SCORED PNA OR FAIL, THE 
SAILOR COMPETES NORMALLY IN SUBSEQUENT CYCLES.
8.  EXAMINATIONS MISSED DUE TO IN-COUNTRY ASSIGNMENTS FOR CPO 
CANDIDATES. 
    A.  IF A CPO CANDIDATE HAS NOT TAKEN AN EARLY OR REGULAR 
EXAMINATION AND CANNOT BE WAIVERED FOR SBE, THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES

        (1) UPON RETURN, THE SAILOR SHOULD REQUEST A LATE EXAMINATION.  
IF THE EXAMINATION IS SCORED SELBD ELIG, AND THE SELECTION BOARD HAS 
ADJOURNED, THE SAILOR WILL COMPETE IN THE NEXT SPECIAL ENLISTED 
SELECTION BOARD.  IF THE CPO CANDIDATE RETURNS DURING THE PERIOD 
SEPTEMBER-DECEMBER, THE SAILOR WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT REGULARLY 
SCHEDULED CPO EXAMINATION (JANUARY).  THE EXAMINATION WILL BE COMPETED 
AGAINST THE EXAMINATION CYCLE MISSED AND THE SAILOR WILL COMPETE IN THE 
NEXT SPECIAL ENLISTED SELECTION BOARD IF A SELBD ELIG SCORE IS ATTAINED.  
IN THE CASE OF A SELBD INELIG SCORE, THE EXAMINATION WILL BE COMPETED 
AGAINST THE CURRENT CYCLE FOR SELECTION BOARD ELIGIBILITY OR 
INELIGIBILITY.
        (2) REQUESTS FOR SUBSTITUTE CPO EXAMINATIONS SHOULD BE 
REQUESTED VIA MESSAGE PER TABLE 4-3 OF BUPERSINST 1430.16E TO NETPDTC 
(N321), INFO COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4811) (PERS-4812 FOR FTS AND RECALLED 
RESERVISTS). 
REQUESTS MUST INCLUDE THE MBR'S NAME, RATE, LAST 4 OF THEIR SSN, AND 
JUSTIFICATION FOR MISSING THE REGULAR EXAMINATION.
        (3) ADMINISTERING THESE SUBSTITUTE CPO EXAMINATIONS ON A 
SPECIFIC DATE OR TO ALL SAILORS ON THE SAME DATE WITHIN THE SAME 
COMMAND IS NOT REQUIRED.
9.  SBE WAIVERS FOR CPO CANDIDATES

    C.  SAILORS WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY DESIGNATED SBE IN ANOTHER RATING

ELIGIBLE FOR THIS WAIVER FOR SOC.
    D.  SAILORS DESIGNATED SBE BY THIS POLICY WILL NOT AFFECT THE 
MINIMUM FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE (FMS) REQUIRED FOR THOSE CANDIDATES WHO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE NAVY-WIDE EXAMINATION.

        (4) THESE TRANSMITTAL LETTERS SHALL BE MAILED VIA FASTEST MEANS 
POSSIBLE (FEDEX WHEN AVAILABLE) IN TIME FOR NETPDTC TO RECEIVE THEM BY 
15 APRIL (RESERVE/FTS) AND 1 MAY (ACTIVE) OR AS PROMULGATED BY 
EXAMINATION CYCLE NAVADMIN.  ELECTRONIC (FAX OR EMAIL) SUBMISSION IS 
NOT PERMITTED.
    F.  FAILURE TO COMPLETE THIS ACTION WILL DENY AN OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE 
MEMBER THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SELECTION BOARD CONSIDERATION. 
    G.  IN THE EVENT A SAILOR IS NOT PROPERLY VALIDATED BY THEIR PARENT 
COMMAND, THEY MUST FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN BUPERSINST 1401.2 
TO REQUEST A SPECIAL SELECTION BOARD.
    H.  AFTER RECEIPT OF THE TRANSMITTAL LETTER, NETPDTC WILL MAIL A 
PROFILE SHEET TO THE PARENT COMMAND IDENTIFYING THESE SAILORS AS 
SELECTION BOARD ELIGIBLE.  SAILORS AND EDUCATIONAL SERVICES OFFICERS 
CAN ALSO VERIFY SELECTION BOARD ELIGIBILITY VIA NETPDTC'S WEBSITE

AREAS, IT WILL BE EXPANDED AS APPROPRIATE.  FOR SAILORS WHO ARE NOT 
DEPLOYING TO OR WHO ARE NOT ALREADY DEPLOYED TO IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, AND 
THE HORN OF AFRICA, SUBSTITUTE EXAMINATION PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN THE
