RMKS/1.  Purpose.  Pending formal amendment to reference (a), this interim 
change adds a new readiness threshold to reference (a).  This interim change 
is effective upon the release of this message. 
 
2.  Background.  Endurance supply measures the days a system remains fully 
operational without an off ship requisition. 
 
3.  Changes.  Endurance supply (Es) is added to amend reference (a), 
subparagraph 3a.  Reference (a), subparagraph 3a is hereby amended and will

possible cost. RBS thresholds are expressed as operational availability (Ao); 
or full mission-capable (FMC) and/or mission capable rates.  Per reference 
(a), the term RBS applies to single echelon and single indenture systems, as 
well as their multi-echelon and multi-indenture extensions, where applicable. 
RBS applies to all methods of product support whether by organic or 
commercially provided practices.  In addition to these measures, Es may be
