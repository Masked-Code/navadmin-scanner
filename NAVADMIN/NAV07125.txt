SUBJ/SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS (SRB)// 
REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/30JAN2007// AMPN/REF A IS SRB PROGRAM INSTRUCTION 
(OPNAVINST 1160.8A).// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES REVISED SRB AWARD LEVELS FOR THE 
REGULAR COMPONENT AND RESERVE COMPONENT FULL TIME SUPPORT
(FTS) AND SUPERSEDES NAVADMIN 330/06.  INCREASED AWARD LEVELS ARE 
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.  POLICIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES IN REF A 
AND THE DEFENSE JOINT MILITARY PAY SYSTEM
(DJMS) PROCEDURES TRAINING GUIDE REMAIN IN EFFECT.
2.  THE SRB PROGRAM ENHANCES THE NAVY'S ABILITY TO SIZE, SHAPE AND 
STABILIZE THE FORCE BY USING A MONETARY INCENTIVE TO ENCOURAGE SAILORS 
WITH CRITICAL SKILLS AND VALUABLE EXPERIENCE TO STAY NAVY.
3.  NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION (NEC) SPECIFIC SRB. 
ACCEPTANCE OF A NEC SPECIFIC SRB CONTRACT INDICATES AWARENESS OF AN 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SAILOR AND THE NAVY TO UTILIZE THE SKILLS 
ATTRIBUTED TO THE NEC DURING THE SAILOR'S ENLISTMENT TO MEET FLEET 
READINESS REQUIREMENTS.  IN SUBSEQUENT TOURS, A SAILOR MUST BE WILLING 
TO BE DETAILED DURING THE NORMAL PROJECTED ROTATION DATE WINDOW TO A 
BILLET AVAILABLE WITHIN THE SRB CONTRACTED NEC, CONSISTENT WITH SEA-
SHORE ROTATION REQUIREMENTS.
4.  INFORMATION ON INCREASED AWARD LEVELS.  AN ELIGIBLE SAILOR WITH A 
COMNAVPERSCOM APPROVED SRB REQUEST WHO HAS NOT YET REENLISTED OR 
EXECUTED A SRB QUALIFYING EXTENSION AND WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM A HIGHER 
AWARD LEVEL UNDER THIS PLAN WILL BE REAPPROVED USING THE NEW AWARD 
LEVELS.  SAILORS SHOULD ALLOW AT LEAST ONE FULL WORKING DAY FOR THE 
REPROGRAMMING OF THE OFFICER PERSONNEL INFORMATION SYSTEM (OPINS) WITH 
THE NEW AWARD LEVELS. 
ONCE OPINS IS REPROGRAMMED, ALL OF THE AFFECTED APPROVALS WILL BE 
UPDATED BY PERS-4811 AND NEW APPROVAL MESSAGES WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO A 
SAILOR S COMMAND.  ALLOW TWO WORKING DAYS FOR THESE NEW MESSAGES TO 
REACH COMMANDS PRIOR TO CONTACTING THE SRB DESK.
5.  PERFORM-TO-SERVE (PTS) REQUIREMENTS.  A SRB REQUEST FOR A SAILOR 
WHO REQUIRES A PTS APPROVAL BEFORE REENLISTING SHALL NOT BE SUBMITTED 
UNTIL THE SAILOR HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE PTS APPROVAL.  THE STATUS OF 
PTS APPROVAL MAY BE VIEWED THROUGH OPINS IN THE ESTIMATED DATE OF LOSS 
TO NAVY (EDLN) FIELD OF THE
I31 SCREEN.
6.  REENLISTMENT PROCEDURES.  SAILORS MAY REQUEST TO REENLIST FOR SRB 
AT ANY TIME WITHIN THE SAME FISCAL YEAR AS THEIR EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE 
OBLIGATED SERVICE (EAOS).  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT SAILORS REENLIST AS 
CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THEIR EAOS TO PRESERVE THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF THEIR 
SRB PAYMENT. 
BECAUSE SRB IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF MONTHS FOR WHICH A 
SAILOR REENLISTS BEYOND HIS OR HER CURRENT EAOS, REENLISTING EARLY 
REDUCES THE SRB PAYMENT.  A SAILOR WHO MUST OBLIGATE SERVICE TO EXECUTE 
A PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION MOVE MAY REENLIST ANY TIME WITHIN THE 
SAME FISCAL YEAR AS THE DETACHMENT MONTH, BUT NOT LATER THAN THE DATE 
OF DETACHMENT FROM THE LAST INTERMEDIATE DUTY STATION.  A SAILOR WHO 
MUST OBLIGATE SERVICE TO EXECUTE A HOMEPORT CHANGE CERTIFICATE MOVE MAY 
REENLIST AT ANY TIME WITHIN THE SAME FISCAL YEAR AS THE SHIFT MONTH.  
AN SRB REENLISTMENT UNDER THE SELECTIVE TRAINING AND REENLISTMENT 
PROGRAM FOR PERSONNEL OTHER THAN THOSE QUALIFIED IN NUCLEAR PROPULSION 
IS LIMITED TO EXECUTION WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THEIR EAOS.  SEE REF A, PARA 
12 FOR OTHER EXCEPTIONS.
7.  OBLIGATE SERVICE TO TRAIN (OTT) AND THEN REENLIST.  SEE REF A, PARA 
12E FOR OTT GUIDANCE.
8.  COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES.
    A.  A COMMAND MUST SUBMIT A SRB REENLISTMENT REQUEST BETWEEN 35-120 
DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE SAILOR S EAOS OR REENLISTMENT DATE TO ENSURE THE 
APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL MESSAGE WILL REACH THE SAILOR'S COMMAND AND THE 
DEFENSE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING SERVICE BEFORE THE REENLISTMENT DATE.  
TIMELINESS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE THE APPROVED PRECERTIFICATION (COMMONLY 
KNOWN AS  PRECERT ) NOTIFIES THE DJMS OF THE SAILOR S INTENT TO 
REENLIST, PREVENTS INTERRUPTION OF PAY, AND ENSURES THE INITIAL SRB 
PAYMENT POSTS TO THE SAILOR'S ACCOUNT.  SAILORS MUST HAVE APPROVED 
PRECERTS BEFORE REENLISTING, THOUGH THEY MAY WAIT UNTIL THEIR EAOS TO 
REENLIST.
    B.  COMMANDS INITIATING SRB PRECERTS MUST ENSURE ALL OF THE DATA 
INCLUDED IN THE PRECERT REQUEST IS CORRECT AND THAT THE SAILOR IS 
ELIGIBLE TO REENLIST FOR THE REQUESTED SRB.
    C.  A SAILOR WITH AN APPROVED PRECERT WHO DOES NOT REENLIST ON THE 
DATE SPECIFIED ON THE PRECERT MESSAGE MUST HAVE THEIR COMMAND CONTACT 
PERS-4811F TO INITIATE A REENLISTMENT CANCELLATION TO AVOID PLACING THE 
MEMBER IN AN OVERPAID STATUS.
9.  CANCELLATION OF NON-OPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  ANY SAILOR MAY CANCEL UP 
TO 24 MONTHS OF A NON-OPERATIVE EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT PROVIDED:
     A.  CANCELLATION OF THE EXTENSION IS AUTHORIZED BY PERS-
4811 BEFORE IT BECOMES OPERATIVE.
    B.  THE SAILOR IMMEDIATELY REENLISTS FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS BEYOND 
THE EXTENDED EAOS, DAY-FOR-DAY.  THE CANCELLED, INOPERATIVE EXTENSION 
WILL COUNT AGAINST THE CALCULATION OF A SAILOR'S SRB AWARD UNLESS THE 
REENLISTMENT IS FOR GREATER THAN THE PERIOD OF THE INOPERATIVE 
EXTENSION PLUS TWO YEARS.
10.  PRECERT REQUIREMENTS.  THE FOLLOWING ARE REQUIRED WHEN SUBMITTING 
PRECERT REQUESTS:
    A.  TO VALIDATE AN OPERATIVE EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT AND TO 
EXPEDITE PROCESSING OF A SRB REQUEST, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN THE 
REMARKS PARAGRAPH OF THE REQUEST:  TERM, NARRATIVE REASON, AUTHORITY, 
AND EXECUTION DATE OF ALL OPERATIVE EXTENSIONS. 
FAILURE TO VERIFY EXTENSIONS WILL RESULT IN REJECTION OF THE REQUEST 
AND MAY DELAY ITS PROCESSING.
    B.  A CONDITIONAL EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT (ANY EXTENSION LESS THAN 
24 MONTHS) MUST MEET THE REASONS AND TERMS SPECIFIED IN REF A AND 
MILPERSMAN 1160-040 AND 1160-080, AND MUST BE APPROVED BY PERS-4811.  
FAILURE TO OBTAIN AN APPROVAL FOR EXTENSION MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF SRB 
ELIGIBILITY.
     C.  PERSONNEL IN A CLOSED LOOP NEC CAN REENLIST BY THE NEC ONLY.
11.  LITTORAL COMBAT SHIP (LCS) GUIDANCE.  SAILORS ASSIGNED TO LCS 
PLATFORMS OR WITH ORDERS TO AN LCS PLATFORM WHO POSSESS AN NEC 
SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED FOR LCS ASSIGNMENT (I.E. SO-CALLED  HYBRID  
SAILORS) ARE AUTHORIZED TO REENLIST FOR THE MORE LUCRATIVE SRB-ELIGIBLE 
NEC, REGARDLESS OF ASSIGNED RATING.
12.  REVISED AWARD PLAN
    A.  THE FOLLOWING RATINGS AND NEC S ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR CONTINUED 
SUCCESS IN THE ONGOING GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM (GWOT) AND NAVY REMAINS 
COMMITTED TO ENSURING WE RETAIN THESE KEY SAILORS.
