RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES IMPLEMENTATION OF EARLY RETIREMENT  
POLICY FOR SAILORS WITH AT LEAST 15 YEARS OF ACTIVE SERVICE AS OF  
1 SEPTEMBER 2012 WHO WERE NOT SELECTED FOR RETENTION BY THE ENLISTED  
RETENTION BOARD (ERB).  FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS MESSAGE, THE TERM  
"RETIREMENT" IS SYNONYMOUS WITH "TRANSFER TO FLEET RESERVE."
2.  SIGNED INTO LAW ON 31 DECEMBER 2011, REF A REINSTATED THE  
AUTHORITY WHICH ORIGINATED IN REF B ALLOWING THE DEPARTMENT OF  
 DEFENSE TO OFFER EARLY RETIREMENT TO SERVICE MEMBERS WHO HAVE COMPLETED AT  
LEAST 15 YEARS OF ACTIVE SERVICE.  TERA IS A DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY,  
NOT AN ENTITLEMENT.  IT IS A TEMPORARY, VOLUNTARY PROGRAM THAT  
 SERVICES MAY USE, UPON APPROVAL BY THE SERVICE SECRETARY, AS PART OF A  
COMPREHENSIVE FORCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY TO SHAPE THE FORCE.  TERA  
 OFFERS VOLUNTARY EARLY RETIREMENT, AT A REDUCED MONTHLY RETIREMENT PAY, TO  
ELIGIBLE MEMBERS PRIOR TO COMPLETING 20 YEARS OF ACTIVE SERVICE.  
 NAVY APPLICATION OF THIS AUTHORITY FOR FY-12, AS APPROVED BY THE SECRETARY  
 OF THE NAVY, IS LIMITED TO THE SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA ESTABLISHED  
BELOW.  FUTURE USE OF TERA IS UNDER CONSIDERATION, AND ANY DECISION  
 TO USE THE AUTHORITY IN THE YEARS AHEAD WILL BE ADDRESSED IN A FUTURE  
NAVADMIN.  SINCE TERA IS NOT AN ENTITLEMENT, ELIGIBLE MEMBERS  
 DESIRING EARLY RETIREMENT MUST APPLY FOR CONSIDERATION, AND APPROVAL IS NOT  
 ASSURED.
3.  ELIGIBILITY.  ONLY ENLISTED MEMBERS CONSIDERED, BUT NOT SELECTED  
 FOR RETENTION, BY THE FY-12 ERB, WHO WILL HAVE COMPLETED AT LEAST 15  
 YEARS OF ACTIVE SERVICE AS OF 1 SEPTEMBER 2012, ARE ELIGIBLE FOR TERA IN  
 FY-12. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS MAY NOT BE WAIVED.
4.  APPLICATION FOR EARLY RETIREMENT.  QUALIFYING MEMBERS DESIRING  
CONSIDERATION FOR EARLY RETIREMENT UNDER TERA MUST APPLY FOLLOWING  
PROCEDURES TO BE PROMULGATED BY A FORTHCOMING NAVADMIN.  NAVY  
 PERSONNEL COMMAND WILL CONTACT EVERY ELIGIBLE SAILOR, OR THEIR COMMAND, TO  
 ENSURE ALL ELIGIBLE SAILORS ARE AWARE OF THIS BENEFIT.  ERB SAILORS APPROVED  
 FOR EARLY RETIREMENT WILL BE VOLUNTARILY RETIRED NO LATER THAN 1  
 SEPTEMBER 2012.   SAILORS OFFERED EARLY RETIREMENT WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR 
INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION PAY (ISP), BUT THEY WILL REMAIN QUALIFIED FOR ENHANCED 
ERB TRANSITION BENEFITS UNTIL THEIR RETIREMENT DATE.  ELIGIBLE SAILORS  
 ARE  
STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF EARLY  
 RETIREMENT WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMAND RETENTION TEAM.
5.  SHORT TERM EXTENSIONS.  ELIGIBLE SAILORS DESIRING TO APPLY FOR  
 EARLY RETIREMENT WHOSE CURRENT END OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE (EAOS) AS  
 EXTENDED, OR SOFT EAOS (SEAOS), IS PRIOR TO 1 SEPTEMBER 2012 SHOULD SUBMIT A  
 REQUEST FOR SHORT TERM EXTENSION TO COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-81), VIA EMAIL TO  
PERS-81(AT)NAVY.MIL, FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING AND APPROVAL.  SAILORS  
 WHO WILL NOT HAVE COMPLETED 15 YEARS OF ACTIVE SERVICE BY THEIR SEAOS, BUT WHO  
 WILL COMPLETE 15 YEARS OF ACTIVE SERVICE BY 1 SEPTEMBER 2012, ARE  
 ELIGIBLE.  DUE TO THEIR TIME-SENSITIVE NATURE, COMMANDS SHOULD NOT DELAY IN 
SUBMITTING  REQUESTS. REQUESTS FOR SHORT TERM EXTENSIONS TO ALLOW APPLICATION 
FOR EARLY  RETIREMENT WILL GENERALLY BE APPROVED TO PERMIT ELIGIBLE SAILORS TO 
REMAIN ON  ACTIVE DUTY UNTIL 1 SEPTEMBER 2012.  ONCE PROGRAM APPLICATION 
PROCEDURES ARE  ESTABLISHED, SAILORS MAY BE ABLE TO SEPARATE PRIOR TO 1 SEPTEMBER 
2012 IF THEIR  APPLICATION IS APPROVED AND THEY HAVE COMPLETED AT LEAST 15 YEARS OF 
ACTIVE SERVICE.
6.  POINTS OF CONTACT:  
NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND POC IS THE NPC CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER AT  
1-866-U-ASK-NPC (1-866-827-5672).
