RMKS/1.  Reference (a) suspended authority to purchase presentation
items (command coins or other items given as awards such as 
plaques, ball caps, etc.) during a sequestered fiscal environment.  
Since that time, Congress has passed a budget and an appropriations 
act.  The following guidance is consistent with reference (b), 
which requires budgetary program execution to proceed on a 
judicious basis.  Commanders must balance the need to formally 
recognize excellence in performance of duty with the continuing 
imperative to conserve scarce fiscal resources. 

2.  Reference (a) is hereby cancelled.  Authority to expend 
appropriated funds (APF) is reinstated subject to existing law and 
policy and the following additional guidelines. 
a.  APF Presentation Items.  Use of APF is authorized to purchase 
presentation items (e.g. command coins, plaques, ball caps, etc.) 
to recognize outstanding performance, specific achievement, or a 
unique achievement contributing to unit effectiveness.  These items 
will normally be presented during officially organized and 
announced unit and/or individual recognition ceremonies.  Examples 
include (without limitation):  Sailor or Civilian of the 
Quarter/Year, Outstanding PRT, etc.  Presentation items may also 
be presented to individuals on an impromptu basis in recognition 
of superior achievement. 
b.  Command Coins.  Navy leaders shall ensure judiciousness 
concerning APF funded command coins.  These coins may not be 
presented solely as mementos, to improve morale, as tokens of 
appreciation, or to recognize expected service.  Personally funded 
items (including personalized items) may be used for this purpose 
if in good taste.  
c.  Leaders at all levels shall ensure the acquisition and use of 
APF funded presentation items are properly documented consistent 
with the requirements of reference (c).  Specifically, command 
coins provided as presentation items must be properly accounted 
for in a written record that includes the name of the individual 
to whom the coin was presented, the date of presentation and the 
specific performance or achievement warranting the award.  
Immediate superiors in the chain of command shall ensure audits 
are conducted as appropriate in accordance with reference (c).
d.  Authority to acquire and present APF funded command coins is 
limited to the Chief of Naval Operations; Vice Chief of Naval 
Operations; Director, Navy Staff (DNS); Chief of Naval Personnel; 
Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy; and officers serving as 
unit Commanders. 
e.  The limitations above do not apply to items purchased with ORF 
funds or items purchased prior to the issuance of reference (a).  
Such expenditures must comply with other applicable regulations 
including the limits of reference (d) on gifts to seniors.

3.  Exceptions to the above limitations may be requested from DNS 
via the chain of command. 

4.  Reference (c) is modified in accordance with this NAVADMIN.

5.  Released by Admiral Michelle Howard, VCNO.//
