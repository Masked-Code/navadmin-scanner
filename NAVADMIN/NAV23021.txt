NARR/REF A IS OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET M-23-07 MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF 
EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES UPDATE TO TRANSITION TO ELECTRONIC 
RECORDS. 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance to Navy commands on the 
implementation of reference (a) regarding transition of records storage and 
services from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Federal 
Records Centers (FRC) to a commercial storage facility.  NARA will no longer 
accept new transfers of records to any FRC after 30 June 2024.  In order to 
ensure that Navy commands have a location to send records after 30 June 2024, 
the Navy has established a contract with Iron Mountain for storage and 
service of Navy records.  Records currently stored at the FRCs will remain at 
those facilities. 
 
2.  To train personnel on the transition to commercial storage, effective 
immediately, all commands must cease transfer of permanent and temporary 
unclassified analog records in all formats (e.g. paper, microfiche, 
microfilm, audio, video, photographs, maps, architectural drawings) to NARA 
FRCs through the Archives and Records Centers Information System (ARCIS) 
Portal.  Electronic records will continue to be stored in electronic record 
keeping systems.  Commands will work through their echelon I/II Records 
Managers (RM) to begin new transfers of all records to Iron Mountain Inc. 
through the use of the Iron Mountain Connect Portal (IMConnect 
Portal).  Transfer of classified records will not be available until 1 March 
2023.  Therefore, all commands may continue to transfer their classified 
records to the FRCs until notified by their command RM. 
 
3.  Standard Operations Procedures (SOP) to request an IMConnect Portal 
account and to transfer records to Iron Mountain can be accessed via the 
Department of the Navy, Assistant for Administration, Directives and Records 
Management (DON /AA DRMD) 
Portal: https://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs/DUSNM/DONAA/DRM/SitePages/Home.as
