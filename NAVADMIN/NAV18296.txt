SUBJ/FISCAL YEAR 2019 FULL-TIME SUPPORT AVIATION COMMAND RETENTION BONUS 
(CORRECTED COPY)//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Fiscal Year 2019 (FY-19) Full Time 
Support (FTS) Aviation Command Retention Bonus (ACRB).

2.  A vital part of developing a total force strategy and maintaining combat 
readiness is to provide appropriate incentives to retain skilled personnel 
for critical naval aviation enterprise billets.  The FTS Aviation Bonus (AvB) 
program, consisting of the Aviation Department Head Retention Bonus (ADHRB) 
and ACRB, incentivizes highly talented, hard-working, career-minded naval 
aviators and naval flight officers to choose to remain for a post command 
commander tour.  The return on investment is the retention for continued 
Naval service of our aviation warfighters with their valuable skill sets and 
leadership experience.  The FTS ADHRB will be released at a later date in 
separate correspondence.

3.  FTS ACRB
    a.  The FTS ACRB is designed to retain those officers with the 
capabilities and command experience in our primary warfighting missions that 
are critical for the future of our service.  Our cadre of commander (CDR) 
commanding officers (CO) lead our naval aviation enterprise today and they 
are the major CDRs and flag officers of tomorrow.  Their skills and 
leadership experience are essential to the success of the Navy.  The FY-19 
ACRB incentivizes their continued service in follow-on assignments requiring 
senior aviation leaders.
    b.  ACRB applicants must have screened on the FY-19 aviation command 
screen board (ACSB) as CO of an eligible operational, operational training or 
special mission CDR command in order to apply.  Eligible commands are those 
for which the annual ACSB selects officers to serve as CO, excluding second-
in- grade/sequential/bonus/fleet replacement squadron commands.  Consult the 
FY-19 ACRB program information for specific eligibility criteria and 
limitations.  The application opportunity commences with the release of this 
NAVADMIN and closes on 31 August 2019.
    c.  All FY-19 ACRB contracts will be worth $100,000.  Eligible officers 
will receive an initial payment of $34,000 and two anniversary payments of 
$33,000.  Participation in the FY-19 ACRB obligates contractees to 3 years of 
obligated service to include full completion of a post command commander 
tour, which may be between 24 and 36 months, depending on assignment.  ACRB 
obligation ends at the completion of 22 years of service, the projected 
rotation date of the assigned post command CDR tour or 3 years from contract 
acceptance date, whichever is later.  ACRB applications for those currently 
under ADHRB obligations, will be accepted, held in abeyance and activated 
upon ADHRB contract expiration.

4.  Additional AvB Information
    a.  Officers accepting AvB contracts are not precluded from participating 
in the career intermission program (CIP).  Officers interested in both AvB 
and CIP should contact the AvB program manager and their detailer for more 
information.
    b.  For further AvB details, eligibility and application procedures,
