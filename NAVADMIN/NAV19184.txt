IMPROVEMENTS.  REF B IS THE JOINT TRAVEL REGULATIONS.  REF C IS VOLUME 4 TO 
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INSTRUCTION 5154.31 GOVERNMENT TRAVEL CHARGE CARD 
REGULATIONS.  REF D IS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
REGULATION (FMR) 7000.14R.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Government Travel Charge Card
(GTCC) pilot program and provides policy and guidance for optional use of the 
GTCC during Permanent Change of Station (PCS) travel.
This pilot is part of Phase Two of the PCS move improvements initiative 
outlined in reference (a).  Use of the GTCC is another step forward in 
improving the PCS experience for Sailors and their families.  Further details 
regarding PCS move improvements are contained in reference (a).  Commanders 
will ensure widest dissemination of this new policy.  All Sailors who elect 
to participate in this pilot program must read this message in its entirety 
to ensure they understand this new process.

2.  This pilot program is effective upon release of this NAVADMIN.
Those choosing to participate must meet the following requirements:
    a.  Existing GTCC cardholders
    b.  CONUS-to-CONUS PCS orders only
    c.  Single or traveling with accompanied dependents
    d.  PCS travel must be less than 30 days total of authorized travel 
including enroute temporary duty under instruction
    e.  Active Duty Navy only
        (1) This does not apply to:
            (a) Accession, separation or retirement orders
            (b) Civilian personnel
            (c) Selected Navy Reserve
            (d) Individual Mobilization Augmentee
            (e) Individual Ready Reserve Navy

3.  The intent of the GTCC pilot is to provide another means in addition to 
an electronic funds transfer/direct deposit (EFT/DD) travel entitlement 
advance to reduce or eliminate Sailors out-of- pocket expenses during a PCS 
move.  While advances remain an option, GTCC provides the benefit of 
immediate access to travel entitlements without having to request an advance 
or to manage the funds in execution.

4.  Policy details.
    a.  Use of the GTCC is authorized for the following travel expenses (see 
reference (b) for additional information):
        (1) Temporary Lodging Expense at the old or new permanent duty 
station (PDS)
        (2) Fuel for a Privately Owned Vehicle (POV), when POV is the 
authorized mode of transportation
        (3) Lodging and meals enroute
        (4) Dislocation Allowance (DLA) related expenses normally used to 
establish a household
        (5) Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) withdrawals.  Note:  ATM fees are 
not a separately reimbursable expense
    b.  GTCC use is not authorized in the following cases:
        (1) GTCC use cannot be combined with an EFT/DD travel advance
        (2) Personally procured moves (PPM), formerly known as do- it-
yourself (DITY) moves
        (3) Commercial airfare for PCS travel.  Commercial airfare will 
continue to be booked by the Navy Passenger Transportation Office (NAVPTO) 
and paid for by a centrally billed account
        (4) Personal travel arrangements incurred during leave in conjunction 
with orders.  See section 040504 of reference (c) for further details.
    c.  Regardless of the option elected, all travelers must submit a travel 
claim within 5 working days of reporting to their new PDS.

5.  Process details.
    a.  The PCS process begins when the Sailor receives PCS orders.
Whether the Sailor chooses to use the GTCC or not, individuals must contact 
their Command Pay and Personnel Administrator (CPPA) to initiate the PCS 
Application for Transfer and Advances (NPPSC Form 1300/1).  The Sailor will 
receive an estimate of the travel entitlement from the CPPA, helping the 
Sailor to decide whether they should consider participating in the GTCC pilot 
program.
    b.  Following the interview with the CPPA, Sailors choosing to 
participate in the GTCC pilot program should inform their command GTCC Agency 
Program Coordinator (APC).  Participating Sailors are required to check-out 
with the GTCC APC prior to departing on PCS orders.  The GTCC APC will:
        (1) Confirm Citibank has activated the account 10 days prior to the 
approved detaching date, allowing GTCC use for temporary lodging
        (2) Confirm Citibank placed the account into a PCS Mission Critical 
status for the duration of the PCS period
        (3) If the Sailor is receiving the DLA entitlement, confirm the 
approved Merchant Category Code (MCC) Group has been activated to allow use 
of the GTCC for DLA related charges (i.e., expenses normally related to 
establishing a new household)
        (4) If applicable based on the PCS cost estimate provided by the 
CPPA, increase the GTCC credit limit if the estimated cost of travel exceeds 
the current GTCC credit limit

6.  Cardholder Instructions.
    a.  Use of the GTCC in excess of the estimated PCS travel entitlement 
could result in a personal indebtedness to the US Government
    b.  There are several advantages and protections provided by the GTCC 
compared to private credit cards.  Some of these protections
are:
        (1) No interest charges on the account
        (2) Available temporary increases to meet mission requirements
        (3) APC and Citi Customer Service Support
        (4) Use of PCS Mission Critical status to ensure payment is not due 
until after check-in
        (5) No delays due to processing of a traditional travel advance
        (6) Automatic travel accident insurance
        (7) Automatic common carrier baggage insurance
    c.  Any cardholder who requires assistance during the PCS travel period 
should contact their detaching command GTCC APC.  If the Sailor has already 
reported to the new PDS, contact the new PDS GTCC APC.  Citi Customer Service 
should be contacted by calling the number on the back of the GTCC if the 
cardholder is unable to reach their GTCC APC.
    d.  Misuse.  Commanders/Supervisors will ensure travel cards are used 
only for official travel related expenses.  Examples of misuse include, but 
are not limited to:
        (1) Expenses unrelated to PCS travel
        (2) ATM cash withdrawals made more than 3 days prior to official 
government travel
        (3) Intentional failure to pay undisputed charges in a timely manner
    e.  Cardholders must submit travel vouchers within 5 working days of 
arrival at the new PDS as outlined in reference (d).  When the travel voucher 
is complete, ensure the split-disbursement option is selected if GTCC was 
used during your PCS move.

7.  You can anticipate future expansion of the program after assessment of 
this pilot with the goal of expanding use of the GTCC for PCS to the widest 
possible population of Sailors and their families.

8.  CPPA/GTCC APC/Travel Office instructions will be issued separately by 
program offices.

9.  All Sailors and families are encouraged to download the MyNavy Family 
application to find authoritive information to assist in navigating military 
life.  The application can be found in the Navy application locker at 
https://www.applocker.navy.mil.
