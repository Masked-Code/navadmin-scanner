and continuation selection boards will convene, when required, immediately 
following the corresponding FY-25 Navy Reserve TAR commander (CDR) promotion

qualified to remain on active duty and meet the requirements in paragraph 3

continuation on the RASL.

2.  Effect of Failure of Selection for Promotion.  A Navy TAR LCDR who twice

in which the officer becomes 62 years of age, whichever is earlier.

4.  Reserve TAR Officers on the RASL who meet any of the criteria in 
paragraph 3 shall check BUPERS Online, via MyNavy Portal at 
https://my.navy.mil/quick-links.html, after release of the respective 
selection ALNAV message, to determine if they were selected for retention and 
continuation.  Once logged into BUPERS Online, click on 
Advancements/Selection Boards and then on the appropriate officer 
(Promotion/Continuation) board to determine the results.

    a.  Reserve TAR O-5 Staff Corps Promotion Selection Board convenes 27 
February 2024.
    b.  Reserve TAR O-5 Line Promotion Selection Board convenes 5 March 2024.

6.  Correspondence addressed to the promotion selection board will not be 
forwarded to a subsequent retention and continuation board for consideration.  
Officers must communicate with each board separately.

7.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a retention and continuation 
selection board via the Letter to the Board (LTB) process.  NAVADMIN 220/19 
announced the introduction of a new application known as Electronic 
Submission of Selection Board Documents (ESSBD), accessible through BOL.  
ESSBD improves the speed, transparency, and confidence of receipt over other 
LTB submission methods, such as hard copy and e-mail submitted letters and 
related attachments.
    a.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to electronically 
submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without attachments, 
and will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) exactly what 
will be delivered and presented to the board.
    b.  To utilize ESSBD, candidates must access document services through 
BOL at https://www.bol.navy.mil/.  On-screen instructions will direct the 
submitter thereafter.
    c.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted.
    d.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command not later than 2359 
(central time zone) 10 days prior to the convening date of the respective 
board, as noted below.  Submitters are cautioned not to wait until the 
deadline date to submit LTBs via ESSBD or other available avenues. 

Selection Board             Convening Date        Due Date / Time
TAR Staff Ret/Cont Board      27 FEB 24         16 FEB 24 / 2359 CST
TAR URL/RL Ret/Cont Board     05 MAR 24         23 FEB 24 / 2359 CST 

    e.  If sending a board package from a non-NMCI network (bumed.mil, 
eu.navy.mil, etc.), please review procedures listed in NAVADMIN 220/19.
    f.  The written communication may call attention to the board, any matter 
concerning the record of the officer that the officer considers important. 
Written communication may include, as enclosures, correspondence from any 
individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not originated by 
the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of the eligible 
officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must contain a written 
acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she desires such 
correspondence be presented to the board.
Correspondence without such an acknowledgement is considered third party 
correspondence and will be returned without being presented to the board.  
Classified correspondence will not be accepted.

8.  Questions regarding LTB submission should be directed to MyNavy Career 
Center by calling 1-833-330-MNCC (1-833-330-6622/DSN:
882-6622).

9.  Questions regarding retention and continuation should be directed to Navy 
Personnel Command PERS-801 at (901) 874-4533/DSN 882.  Additional information 
is also available at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
