RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes ref (a), and incorporates significant bonus 
program changes per ref (b) and ref (c).  

2.  Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) program details. 
    a.  Initial and anniversary payments. 
        (1) All bonuses authorized by this NAVADMIN will be paid in 
installments, less taxes.  The initial payment will equal 50 percent of the 
total bonus amount.  Anniversary payments will be the remaining 50 percent of 
the total bonus amount, divided equally over the remainder of the obligation 
(either two or five years).
        (2) Eligibility for anniversary payments is contingent upon the 
member maintaining satisfactory participation per ref (d), in the designated 
rating and/or Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) for each year of the bonus 
contract.
    b.  SRB Program eligibility.     
        (1) A Sailor's reenlistment date must fall within the fiscal year 
(FY) of their current End of Obligated Service (EOS), except for those who 
obligate service (OBLISERV) in support of mobilizations.  Sailors who have or 
had, an EOS in the current FY who extended their enlistment beyond 30 
September to incur required OBLISERV for mobilization orders, may reenlist 
for SRB under this NAVADMIN provided the new contract end date exceeds 
member's previous EOS as extended.  The Sailor's Navy Reserve Activity (NRA) 
must submit copies of mobilization orders and NAVPERS 1070/621 authorizing 
extension of contract as supporting documentation to application procedures 
in paragraph 3. 
        (2) Sailors must have less than 20 years total federal military 
service as calculated from their pay entry base date (PEBD)on the date of the 
qualifying reenlistment.
        (3) Sailors must complete the period of obligation for which this SRB 
is offered prior to 24 years of federal military service.  Per ref (b), bonus 
payments cannot be made beyond 24 years of service.  
        (4) Sailors with greater than 18 years of service from PEBD are 
limited to a 3-year SRB.  
        (5) Extensions are not authorized to gain eligibility for this SRB.            
        (6) Sailors currently serving under a contractual obligation for any 
prior bonus must be within 45 days of completing that obligation prior to 
reenlisting to qualify for this SRB.
        (7) Per ref (b), bonuses for reenlistment (exclusive of prior-service 
affiliation and enlistment bonuses) shall not exceed $80,000 in a career.  
Sailors are encouraged to maximize their SRB by reenlisting for the greater 
period of obligation, as long as their career total combined SRB payments do 
not exceed $80,000.  Ref (d), section 1100-010 and 1100-020 updates will be 
promulgated separate correspondence.
    c.  Rating conversion.  Current Selected Reserve (SELRES) Sailors who are 
approved for change of rating to a bonus eligible rating listed in paragraph 
6 may be eligible for a reenlistment bonus as follows: 
        (1) Change of rating approved via direct conversion. 
            (a) Sailors approved for a change of rating and whose EOS 
conforms to paragraph 2.b.(1), may reenlist immediately upon change of rating 
approval to qualify for a reenlistment bonus. 
            (b) The initial bonus payment shall be processed and paid after 
reenlistment, immediately after Commander, Naval Recruiting Command (N11), 
receives the bonus application and the rating change is reflected in the Navy 
Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).
        (2) Change of rating approved via successful competition or 
concurrent change of rating. 
            (a) Sailors who successfully complete rating conversion 
requirements and whose EOS conforms to paragraph 2.b.(1), may reenlist for a 
reenlistment bonus.  Sailors must meet skill qualification prior to payment 
of the SRB for a member transferring into a designated military skill.
            (b)    Sailors who have successfully completed the change of 
rating requirements, but whose EOS does not conform to paragraph 2.b.(1), are 
not eligible for a reenlistment bonus.
            (c)    The initial bonus payment shall be processed and paid to 
Sailors in this category only after completing all requirements to 
permanently affect the change of rating.
            (d) All other basic eligibility criteria contained in ref (b) 
remain in effect. 

3.  Eligibility determination and bonus application procedures.  NRAs shall 
determine bonus eligibility in accordance with ref (b), ref (d) and this 
message.  Ref (b) and this NAVADMIN supersedes ref (d) where conflicts exist.
    a.    Complete bonus written agreements in the Reserve Bonus Application 
Module (RBAM).  This is the only authorized method to complete enlisted bonus 
written agreements.  RBAM can be accessed via the Navy Reserve Homeport at 
https://private.navyreserve.navy.mil/cnrfc/n-codes/n1/cnrfc_n112/rbam.  For 
questions, contact Commander, Navy Reserve Forces Command (COMNAVRESFORCOM) 
(N11) incentive program specialists via e-mail at 
CNRFC_bonus_shop(at)navy.mil or telephone at (757) 322-2646/2644/3637 DSN 
262. 
    b.  Scan and submit all required documents listed on the CNRFC (N112) 
Enlisted Incentives Homeport as a single (multiple page) PDF file to 
COMNAVRESFORCOM (N11) via RBAM.  Missing documents will delay bonus payment 
processing.  If unable to scan documents, e-mail the address above for 
guidance.

4.  Zone eligibility criteria.  
    a.  Zone A - Sailors with up to 8 years service from PEBD.  Sailors in 
Zone A are eligible to reenlist if they have completed their enlistment 
program's required obligation, regardless of the time remaining on their 
initial military service obligation (MSO).  Specifically, upon completion of 
New Accession Trainee's (NAT) six year SELRES obligation, NAT Sailors are 
eligible to reenlist provided the length of the new contract exceeds their 
MSO and current EOS.
    b.  Zone B - Sailors with more than 8 years and up to 14 years service 
from PEBD. 
    c.  Zone C - Sailors with more than 14 years and up to 20 years service

Note 1:  Where "Any" is listed in the "Rating/Rate" column, any rating/rate, 
who also holds the required NEC per the "NEC" column, is eligible. 
Note 2:  Where multiple ratings are listed in the "Rating" column, any of 
those ratings, who also holds the required NEC per the "NEC" column, is 
eligible.
Note 3:  Where "Any" is listed in the "NEC" column, ratings/rates in the 
"Rating/Rate" column, holding any Rating Series NEC, is eligible.  NEC 0000, 
Defense Grouping NECs, Conversion Series NECs, or other Special Series NECs 
not classified as Ratings Series NECs, are ineligible.  See ref (f) for 
definitions of defense grouping, conversion series and other special series 
NECs.
Note 4:  Where a member qualifies for multiple tiers, the highest tier 
applies.  For example, a GM with NEC 0814 and 9536 in Zone B would qualify 
for tier 2 "GM 9536".
Note 5:  NECs must be listed in either the primary NEC or secondary NEC 
position in NSIPS before bonus payment can be made.

7.  Sailors serving in the ratings, rates and/or NECs listed in paragraph 6 
may also apply for the Montgomery GI Bill - Selected Reserve kicker program 
provided they meet eligibility criteria contained in ref (g). 

8.  Repayment.  Repayment policy is governed by refs (c), (d), and (h), which 
collectively determine when repayment of the unearned portion of a bonus is 
required, not required but left to Secretarial discretion, or prohibited.  
Ref (c) requires repayment with certain exceptions.  As a general rule, 
repayment of any unearned portion of a bonus will be sought for failure to a 
complete the terms of the SRB obligation or meet required performance and 
discipline standards. 
    a.    Repayment will not be sought when a member fails to complete an SRB 
contract in the following circumstances IAW with the complete policy cited 
for each circumstance:
        (1) Death, not due to misconduct, IAW ref (h), Table 2-1, Rule 1;
        (2) Injury or illness, not due to misconduct, under specified 
conditions, resulting in separation or retirement for disability IAW ref (h), 
Table 2-1, Rule 2;
        (3) Completion of the contract is prevented by the Navy due to force 
management actions per ref (h), Table 2-1, Rules 5, 6 and 7.
    b.  Repayment is at the discretion of the Secretarial process when a 
member fails to complete an SRB contract in the circumstances below, IAW with 
the complete policy cited for each circumstance.  Note that repayment action 
will be initiated for these circumstances, until and unless the Secretarial 
process waives or remits recoupment:
        (1) Separation for medical reasons not covered by paragraph 14.a.2, 
IAW ref (h) Table 2-1, Rule 3;
        (2) Medical reasons preclude completion of SRB contract, but member 
is not separated and continues in another capacity IAW ref (h) Table 2-1, 
Rule 4;
        (3) The Secretarial process determines that recoupment is contrary to 
a personnel policy or management objective, against equity or good 
conscience, or contrary to the best interest of the United States per ref 
(h).
    c.  Repayment is required for any other situation not covered by 
paragraph 8.a or 8.b.
    d.  Per ref (b), Sailors must maintain normal skill progression as 
determined by their unit commanding officer (CO).  Sailors who fail to 
maintain normal skill progression may have their SRB terminated and any 
unearned amount of the SRB processed for repayment.  COs shall notify CNRFC 
(N11) via the Echelon IV and Echelon V chain of command if a member in 
receipt of an SRB paid under this NAVADMIN fails to meet normal skill 
progression, and recommend bonus termination.  The unit CO shall include 
supporting documentation.  Examples of supporting documentation can include, 
but are not limited to:  documented failure to qualify for billet-related 
skills or watch stations, not recommended for retention or not recommended 
for advancement on an evaluation.  CNRFC (N11) is the final authority for 
adjudication of failure to meet normal skillprogression determinations.

9.  Point of contact is  Mr. Jim Johnson, CNRFC (N1C21), at (757) 322-2245 or
