SUBJ/IMPLEMENTATION OF ELECTRONIC LEAVE//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE PHASED IMPLEMENTATION OF SELF-SERVICE 
ELECTRONIC LEAVE (E-LEAVE).

2.  LEAVE PROCESSING ACCOUNTS FOR 21.6 PERCENT OF ALL PAY TRANSACTIONS 
SUBMITTED EACH YEAR.  ONCE THIS E-LEAVE PROCESS IS FULLY  IMPLEMENTED, WE 
PROJECT SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS IN MANHOURS AND PROCESSING TIME.  LEAVE 
ADMINISTRATION REMAINS A COMMAND RESPONSIBILITY AND INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF 
THIS INITIATIVE WILL REQUIRE ALL HANDS PARTICIPATION.

3.  THE E-LEAVE REQUEST WILL RESIDE INSIDE THE NAVY STANDARD INTEGRATED 
PERSONNEL SYSTEM (NSIPS) ELECTRONIC SERVICE RECORD (ESR) APPLICATION.  
THEREFORE, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT EACH SAILOR ESTABLISH ACCESS AND ROUTINELY 
VIEW THE ESR TO BECOME COMFORTABLE WITH THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE PROGRAM.  
ONCE PREPARED, THE LEAVE REQUEST WILL ELECTRONICALLY ROUTE THROUGH THE CHAIN 
OF COMMAND FOR APPROVAL.  THIS PROCESS WILL STREAMLINE A SAILOR?S REQUEST FOR 
LEAVE WITHOUT THE PAPER TRAIL, ELIMINATE DELAYS DUE TO MISROUTING OF THE PAPER 
COPY, AUTOMATE THE COMMAND?S LEAVE CONTROL LOG, AND ENSURE THAT PAY 
ENTITLEMENTS ARE PROPERLY CREDITED WITHOUT THE NEED TO SUBMIT ANY DOCUMENTS TO 
A SUPPORTING DISBURSING OFFICE OR PERSONNEL SUPPORT DETACHMENT (PSD).

4.  SHORE-BASED IMPLEMENTATION WILL BEGIN IN AUGUST 2010.  AFLOAT 
IMPLEMENTATION WILL OCCUR OVER THE FOLLOWING 24 MONTHS AS EACH SHIP?S NSIPS 
SERVER IS UPGRADED WITH THE CORRECT SOFTWARE RELEASE.  FUTURE NAVADMINS WILL 
PROVIDE DETAILED GUIDANCE ON ACCOUNT ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT FOR ASHORE 
AND AFLOAT PERSONNEL, TO INCLUDE THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND USER ROLES AND 
RESPONSIBILITIES.
