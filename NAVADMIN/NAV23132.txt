RMKS/1.  Reference (a) directed the formation of the first cohort of Navy and 
Marine Corps students for enrollment in the United States Naval Community 
College (USNCC) Pilot program. USNCC is taking applications for the first 
cohort of Maritime Logistics associate degree students with a deadline of 
18 June 2023.  There is no tuition, mandatory course fees, or course material 
costs incurred by parent commands or participating students.  Multiple more 
convenings will occur this calendar year.  Future application windows, 
including a window that will close 30 July 2023, will be promulgated on the 
USNCC website at https://www.usncc.edu/, on USNCC social media sites, road 
show briefs, and additional messages. 
 
2.  Background.  The USNCC started Pilot II in January 2022.  The intent of 
this pilot is to evaluate academic programs, learning delivery systems, and 
student performance through the opportunity to complete online college 
courses. 
    a.  The next USNCC professional concentration area opening is Maritime 
Logistics (open application period starts June 2023 and course starts 
approximately August 2023). The Associate of Science in Logistics (Maritime) 
program examines the theories, concepts, and components of logistics, 
with particular attention to serving/supporting maritime and military 
logistics operations. Additionally, students will gain an understanding 
of logistics and supply chain management, communications, financial 
management and accounting, analytics, and the managerial skills necessary to 
be successful in maritime and military logistics, as well as supply chain 
management and logistics required in private industry. This program confers 
an associate degree with embedded certificates, to include the Naval Studies 
Certificate. 
    b.  The USNCC Naval Studies Certificate comprises five USNCC delivered 
courses and will be incorporated into all USNCC degree programs: 
        (1)  NAV 101 Naval Ethics & Leadership 
        (2)  NAV 102 Modern Naval History 
        (3)  NAV 103 Naval Force Design 
        (4)  NAV 104 Civilian / Military Relations, Organization, and 
American Government 
        (5)  NAV 105 Introduction to the Geopolitical Environment 
    c.  Classes are taught 100% online and asynchronously. Most courses are 
taught in the 8 to 16-week course format, depending on the schedule of the 
participating colleges and complexity of course material.
