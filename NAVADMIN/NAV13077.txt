RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES REVISED SRB AWARD LEVELS FOR ACTIVE COMPONENT (AC) AND RESERVE COMPONENT (RC) FULL TIME SUPPORT (FTS), AND SUPERSEDES REF A.

2.  INCREASED AWARD LEVELS ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND DECREASED LEVELS ARE EFFECTIVE 30 DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THIS NAVADMIN.
THE POLICY UPDATE CONTAINED IN THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES GUIDANCE REGARDING SOFT END OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE (SEAOS).

3.  SAILORS WHO ARE WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF SEAOS WITH A DENIED FINAL-ACTIVE (DFA) PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) STATUS AS A RESULT OF A PREVIOUS APPLICATION MARKED "INTENDS TO SEPARATE" MAY CONTACT THEIR RESPECTIVE ENLISTED COMMUNITY MANAGER (ECM) TO REQUEST A FLEET RIDE-PTS RESET FOR AN ADDITIONAL PTS IN-RATE APPLICATION.  IF AN ADDITIONAL PTS IN-RATE APPLICATION IS REQUESTED ANY APPROVED SELECTIVE RESERVE (SELRES) PTS QUOTA WILL BE CANCELED.  SAILORS WHO WERE DISAPPROVED FOR REENLISTMENT IN FLEET RIDE-PTS, OR HAD A QUOTA REVOKED DUE TO "FAILURE TO OLBISERV" ARE NOT ELIGIBLE.

4.  ADDITIONALLY, THIS MESSAGE CLARIFIES SRB RECOUPMENT POLICY.
SPECIFICS CAN BE FOUND IN PARAGRAPH 14.

5.  CONTINUING WITH THE POLICY INITIATED BY REFERENCE B, REENLISTMENT REQUESTS FOR THE FOLLOWING SRB AWARD LEVELS WILL BE APPROVED BASED ON QUOTA AVAILABILITY.  ELIGIBLE SAILORS DESIRING SRB REENLISTMENT ARE ENCOURAGED TO WORK WITH THEIR CHAIN OF COMMAND AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE WITHIN THEIR REENLISTMENT WINDOW TO MAXIMIZE POTENTIAL FOR SRB.

7.  NOTES
    A.  THE SRB FOR THIS RATING OR NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION (NEC) IS TIED TO AN INCUMBENT BILLET OR TO ORDERS NEGOTIATED FOR THE NEXT BILLET.  COMMANDS MUST VERIFY THE MEMBER IS CURRENTLY IN, OR HAS ORDERS TO A BILLET REQUIRING THIS NEC AND ANNOTATE THIS VERIFICATION IN THE COMMENTS SECTION OF THE PRECERT REQUEST.
    B.  AN SRB APPROVAL FOR ALL CT, IT, AND ITS RATINGS WILL BE CONTINGENT UPON MEMBER HAVING A CURRENT SINGLE SCOPE BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION (SSBI), AN ACTIVE SSBI OR RECENT SUBMISSION OF AN SSBI PACKAGE.  COMMANDS MUST VERIFY THE MEMBER HAS A CURRENT SSBI, ACTIVE SSBI, OR HAS SUBMITTED A SSBI PACKAGE AND MAKE NOTE OF THIS IN THE COMMENTS SECTION OF THE PRECERT REQUEST.
    C.  MEMBERS HOLDING INACTIVE NUCLEAR NECS 3359 AND 3389 MAY REENLIST AT THE AWARD LEVEL SPECIFIED FOR THE LAST ACTIVE NEC HELD WITH PRIOR ECM APPROVAL VIA E-MAIL NXAG_N133D2(AT)NAVY.MIL OR (703) 604-5491/DSN 664.  REENLISTMENT COMPENSATION FOR ZONE C NUCLEAR TRAINED PERSONNEL HOLDING A NUCLEAR SUPERVISOR NEC SHALL BE PROVIDED UNDER THE ENLISTED SUPERVISOR RETENTION PAY (ESRP) PROGRAM IAW POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DETAILED IN REF F.
    D.  LETTERS APPEARING WITH AN NEC ARE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE USE ONLY.
    E.  SUBSURFACE OR SURFACE DESIGNATION DOES NOT MEAN AN INDIVIDUAL MUST BE SUBSURFACE OR ENLISTED SURFACE WARFARE SPECIALIST QUALIFIED, BUT INDICATES THE COMPONENT OF THE RATING IN WHICH THEY CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO SERVE.  TRAINING, QUALIFICATIONS, AND PREVIOUS OR PROJECTED DUTY ASSIGNMENTS AT SEA WILL INDICATE THE APPROPRIATE RATING COMPONENT.  WHEN USING THE FORCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (FORMAN) AND THE OFFICER PERSONNEL INFORMATION SYSTEM (OPINS) TO INPUT A SRB PRECERT REQUEST, USE THE RATING (WITH APPROPRIATE SUFFIX DESIGNATION)/NEC AS SPECIFIED IN THIS NAVADMIN.  FOR EXAMPLE, SUBSURFACE ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN WITH NO NEC WOULD SUBMIT 'ETSS' ON PRECERT FOR RATING.
    F.  SUBSURFACE NECS.  SUBSURFACE ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN 14XXA QQQQ IDENTIFIES ALL SUBSURFACE ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN COMMUNICATIONS SAILORS WHO HOLD NECS BEGINNING WITH 14.  SUBSURFACE ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN NAVIGATION 14XXB IDENTIFIES SUBSURFACE ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN NAVIGATION SAILORS AND INCLUDES ALL SUBSURFACE ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN NAVIGATION NECS BEGINNING WITH 14.
    G.  RATINGS ELIGIBLE FOR NEC 0304 ARE:  AWO, ET, QM, AND OS.
    H.  NEC 0000 (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS "QUAD ZERO") IS LISTED HERE TO ESTABLISH THAT SAILORS IN THESE RATINGS/CAREER FIELDS CAN HOLD ANY OR NO NEC AND STILL BE QUALIFIED FOR SRB PROVIDED THEY MEET ALL OTHER APPLICABLE NON-NEC RELATED CRITERIA.
    I. THE FOLLOWING NECS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE NEC 7815S: 7805, 7817, 7873, 7875, AND 7876.

8.  LITTORAL COMBAT SHIP (LCS) GUIDANCE.  SAILORS ASSIGNED TO LCS PLATFORMS OR WITH ORDERS TO AN LCS PLATFORM WHO POSSESS MULTIPLE NEC'S SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED FOR LCS ASSIGNMENT ARE AUTHORIZED TO REENLIST FOR THE MOST LUCRATIVE SRB-ELIGIBLE NEC, REGARDLESS OF ASSIGNED RATING.

9.  EARLY REENLISTMENT OPPORTUNITY:  SAILORS SERVING IN TIER ONE SKILLS, AS WELL AS THE EXCEPTIONS OUTLINED IN PARA 12.A OF REF B AND PARA 4 OF REF C, ARE ELIGIBLE TO REENLIST EARLY ANY TIME WITHIN THE FISCAL YEAR OF THEIR END OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE (EAOS).  NUCLEAR SAILORS MAY STILL CROSS FISCAL YEAR BOUNDARIES.  ADDITIONALLY, SAILORS SERVING IN TIER  TWO OR TIER THREE SRB SKILLS WHO RECEIVED AN EP IN BLOCK 45 OF THEIR MOST RECENT REGULAR PERIODIC EVALUATION OR FITNESS REPORT WILL BE ALLOWED  TO REENLIST EARLY ANY TIME WITHIN THE FISCAL YEAR OF THEIR EAOS.  NO TRANSFER, CONCURRENT, OR SPECIAL EVALUATIONS WILL APPLY.  SAILORS ADVANCED WITHIN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THEIR EAOS WILL BE ALLOWED TO SUBSTITUTE THE LAST REGULAR PERIODIC EVALUATION OR FITNESS REPORT IN THEIR PREVIOUS PAYGRADE.  PERSONNEL MUST EMAIL A SIGNED COPY OF THE EVALUATION TO NAVPERSCOM (PERS-811) ONCE THEIR PRECERT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS ONLY FOR THOSE THAT FALL UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH.

10.  SRB PRECERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
    A.  PERFORM-TO-SERVE (PTS):  COMMANDS ARE AUTHORIZED TO SUBMIT SRB REENLISTMENT REQUESTS PRIOR TO A MEMBER RECEIVING A PTS QUOTA; HOWEVER, THE PTS QUOTA REQUEST MUST HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND THE SRB REQUEST WILL NOT BE PROCESSED UNTIL THE MEMBER HAS RECEIVED PTS CONFIRMATION.  SRB REQUESTS WITHOUT PTS APPROVAL WILL STILL BE REJECTED IN THE OFFICER PERSONNEL INFORMATION SYSTEM (OPINS) TO KEEP THE COMMAND INFORMED OF POTENTIAL SRB APPROVAL ISSUES.  ONCE A MEMBER HAS AN APPROVED PTS QUOTA, THE COMMAND SHOULD CONTACT PERS-811 TO CLEAR ANY REJECTIONS.
    B.  COMMANDS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT SRB REENLISTMENT REQUESTS TO PERS-811 VIA OPINS OR NSIPS 35-120 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE SAILOR'S REQUESTED REENLISTMENT DATE.  REQUESTS SUBMITTED LESS THAN 35 DAYS PRIOR TO THE REQUESTED REENLISTMENT DATE WILL BE REJECTED; HOWEVER, COMMANDS MAY CONTACT PERS-811 FOR WAIVER ELIGIBILITY AND PROCEDURES.
SAILORS MUST HAVE APPROVED PRECERTS BEFORE REENLISTING.  THE SERVICING PERSONNEL OFFICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING THE REENLISTMENT, POSTING THE CONTRACT, RELEASING THE FIRST PAYMENT, AND VERIFYING THE MASTER MILITARY PAY ACCOUNT.
    C.  SAILORS WITH APPROVED PRECERTS WHO DO NOT REENLIST ON THE DATE OR FOR THE TERM SPECIFIED IN THE PRECERT MESSAGE MUST HAVE THEIR COMMAND CONTACT NAVPERSCOM (PERS-811) TO INITIATE A REENLISTMENT CANCELLATION TO AVOID PLACING SAILORS IN AN OVERPAID STATUS.
    D.  TO VALIDATE AN INOPERATIVE EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT AND EXPEDITE PROCESSING OF AN SRB REQUEST, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN THE REMARKS PARAGRAPH OF THE REQUEST:  TERM, NARRATIVE REASON, AUTHORITY, AND EXECUTION DATE OF ALL INOPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  FAILURE TO VERIFY EXTENSIONS WILL CAUSE PROCESSING DELAYS AND MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF THE REQUEST OR AN APPROVAL AT A LOWER AMOUNT.
    E.  SAILORS MUST OBTAIN AN APPROVAL FOR EXTENSION FROM NAVPERSCOM (PERS-811) IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF SRB ELIGIBILITY.

11.  THE FOLLOWING GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED ON NEC-SPECIFIC SRB AND LATERAL CONVERSIONS.  ACCEPTANCE OF A NEC-SPECIFIC SRB CONTRACT INDICATES AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SAILOR AND THE NAVY TO USE SKILLS ATTRIBUTED TO THE NEC DURING THE SAILOR'S ENLISTMENT TO MEET FLEET READINESS REQUIREMENTS.  IN SUBSEQUENT TOURS, A SAILOR MUST BE WILLING TO BE DETAILED DURING THE NORMAL PROJECTED ROTATION DATE WINDOW TO AN AVAILABLE BILLET WITHIN THE SRB CONTRACTED NEC, CONSISTENT WITH SEA-SHORE FLOW REQUIREMENTS.  LATERAL CONVERSIONS MUST FOLLOW REF B, PARA 12.D.  LATERAL CONVERSION REQUESTS WILL NOT BE PROCESSED MORE THAN NINE MONTHS BEFORE THE EAOS.  CONVERSIONS TO A RATE WITH A LOWER AWARD LEVEL WILL NOT BE APPROVED.  PERSONNEL IN A 'CLOSED-LOOP' NEC CAN REENLIST BY THE NEC ONLY.

12.  OBLIGATED SERVICE TO TRAIN (OTT) AND THEN REENLIST.  SEE REF B, PARA 12.E., FOR OTT GUIDANCE.  REQUESTS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED TO NAVPERSCOM (PERS-811) EXTENSION DESK VIA NAVPERS 1306/7, ENLISTED PERSONNEL ACTION REQUEST.  A COPY OF THE AUTHORIZATION MESSAGE SHOULD QQQQ BE RETAINED BY THE SAILOR UNTIL THE SRB REENLISTMENT ON GRADUATION DAY FROM THE COURSE OF INSTRUCTION.  USE CODE 1CC (1RC FOR FTS) FOR OTT SRB REQUESTS IN OPINS OR NSIPS.

13.  INOPERATIVE EXTENSIONS POLICY.  IN KEEPING WITH DOD POLICY, PERSONNEL WHO ACCEPTED AN ENLISTMENT BONUS FOR EXTENDED ENLISTMENT (EBEE), AS REFLECTED ON THEIR NAVCRUIT 1133/52, ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE THIS INOPERATIVE EXTENSION TIME IN THE SRB CALCULATION.
SAILORS WHO HAVE INOPERATIVE EXTENSION TIME THROUGH A FIVE-YEAR OBLIGATION OR SIX-YEAR OBLIGATION PROGRAM, OR AS AUTHORIZED IN NAVADMIN 007/09, MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE UP TO 24 MONTHS OF INOPERATIVE EXTENSION TIME COUNT TOWARDS THE SRB CALCULATION PROVIDED THE REENLISTMENT RESULTS IN A NEW EAOS THAT IS AT LEAST 24 MONTHS DAY-FOR-DAY PAST THE CURRENT EXTENDED EAOS.  THIS CALCULATION IS PERFORMED AUTOMATICALLY BY NAVPERSCOM (PERS-811).  LOCAL COMMANDS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO CANCEL OR CHANGE EXTENSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMMEDIATE SRB REENLISTMENTS.  COMMANDS MUST VERIFY AND ANNOTATE ON THE PRECERT REQUEST WHETHER ANY INOPERATIVE EXTENSION TIME NOTED IS PART OF AN ENLISTED BONUS FOR EXTENDED ENLISTMENT (EBEE) CONTRACT.

14.  REPAYMENT.  REPAYMENT POLICY IS GOVERNED BY SECTION 303A(E) OF TITLE 37, U.S.C. AND REFS G THROUGH I, WHICH COLLECTIVELY DETERMINE WHEN REPAYMENT OF THE UNEARNED PORTION OF A BONUS IS REQUIRED, NOT REQUIRED BUT LEFT TO SECRETARIAL DISCRETION, OR PROHIBITED.  SECTION
