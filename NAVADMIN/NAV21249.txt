RMKS/1.  Background.  As the maritime protectors of our country in peacetime 
and war, we require a healthy and mission ready force.
Vaccination is the most effective tool we have to prevent widespread 
manifestation of COVID-19 in our force today.  Considering this threat to the 
health and readiness of service members, references
(a) and (b) directed mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 for all Active 
Duty and Reserve Navy service members.  Reference (c) announced the Chief of 
Naval Personnel (CNP) as the COVID Consolidated Disposition Authority (CCDA) 
and provided additional guidance.

2.  Policy.  In order to maximize readiness, it is the policy goal of the 
Navy to achieve a fully vaccinated force against the persistent and lethal 
threat of COVID-19.  To date over 99 percent of Active Duty Navy service 
members have met their readiness responsibility by completing or initiating a 
COVID-19 vaccination series.

(https://portal.secnav.navy.mil/cop/crc/covid/).  Submission of data may be 
delegated to subordinate echelon three commands.  A template excel file is
