RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces a modification to paragraphs 1 through 5 of 
reference (a) and the Fiscal Year 2020 Active-Duty Officer Continuation Plan.  
This modification implements enhanced authorities enacted by reference (b), 
permitting the continuation of officers in certain military specialties and 
career tracks under the Up-and-Stay initiative.  Apart from continuation 
selection boards specified in reference (a), two additional continuation 
selection boards will convene on 16 September 2019, or as soon as practicable 
thereafter.  One board will consider captains (CAPT) in the engineering duty 
officer and unrestricted line (URL) officer competitive categories who have a 
specific designation as acquisition corps (AC) members.  The other board will 
consider foreign area officer captains who are currently serving, or have 
completed a tour, as defense attach (DATT) or naval attach (NATT) and URL 
CAPTs who are selected for are currently serving, or who have completed, a 
tour as a DATT or NATT.

2.  Boards will convene under references (c), (d) and (e), which authorizes 
the Secretary of the Navy to convene continuation selection boards to retain 
on active-duty beyond 30 years of active commissioned service officers 
serving in the rank of CAPT who have designated critical skills.  Eligible 
officers on the active-duty list who meet the requirements in paragraph 4 
will be considered for continuation.

3.  Prerequisite assignments for necessary service as an AC major program 
manager or as a NATT or DATT often leave limited time for the officer to 
serve prior to statutory retirement.  Continuation of a select number of 
these officers will provide the Navy with a significant return on investment 
by retaining critical expertise in the officer corps, which is a pillar of 
our Up and Stay initiative.

4.  Eligibility.  Captains must not be on a rear admiral (lower half) 
promotion list and must have 28 or more years of active commissioned service 
on the convening date of the board.
    a.  Captain (CAPT) engineering duty officers and URL who are AC members 
and hold one or more of the following additional qualification designation 
(AQD) codes:
        (1) AA3  Program Management
        (2) AG3  Production, Quality, and Manufacturing
        (3) AS3  Engineering
    b.  CAPT foreign area officers who are currently serving or have 
completed a tour in the Defense Attach Service as DATT or NATT.
    c.  CAPT URL:
        (1) Who holds one or more of the following AQD codes:
            (a)  CBF  Major Shore Installation Command
            (b)  CBJ  Post-Major Shore Installation Command
            (c)  CF1-6  Major Shore Command
            (e)  KG8  Explosive Ordnance Disposal Major Command
            (f)  LN4  Captain Command
            (g)  LN8  Sequential Command Captain
            (h)  QG1  Special Warfare Major Command
            (i)  SC8  Served Major Command
            (j)  2D3  Major Command Qualified
        (2) Who is selected for, are currently serving or who have completed 
a tour in the Defense Attach Service as DATT or NATT.

5.  Eligible officers are encouraged to review reference (a) guidance 
concerning providing letters to the board.  Officers selected by these boards 
will be continued to 33 years of active commissioned service, subject to the 
statutory maximum age requirement of 62 years per reference (f).

6.  All other provisions of reference (a) remain in effect.

7.  This NAVADMIN will be canceled for record purposes on 30 September 2019.
