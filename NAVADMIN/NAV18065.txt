SUBJ/ACTIVE COMPONENT 2018 AVIATION RETENTION BONUSES AND ACTIVE/RESERVE 
COMPONENT AVIATION INCENTIVE PAY PROGRAM UPDATE//

REF/A/DOC/SECNAV/6FEB18//
REF/B/DOC/OPNAV/6AUG10//
NARR/REF(A) IS SECNAVINST 7220.88, AVIATION INCENTIVE PAYS AND BONUS PROGRAM.  
REF B IS OPNAVINST 7220.18, AVIATION CAREER INCENTIVE PAY.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the FY-18 Aviation Department Head Retention 
Bonus (ADHRB) and Aviation Command Retention Bonuses (ACRB) for the Active 
Component (AC), and the authorization of new Aviation Incentive Pay (AvIP) 
rates, formerly Aviation Career Incentive Pay, for both the AC and Reserve 
Component (RC).

2.  A vital part of developing a total force strategy and maintaining combat 
readiness is to provide appropriate incentives to retain skilled personnel 
for critical naval aviation enterprise billets.  The AC Aviation Bonus (AvB) 
program, consisting of the ADHRB and ACRB, incentivizes highly talented, 
hard-working, career-minded Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers (NFO) to 
choose to remain on active duty.  Our return on investment is the retention 
for continued Navy service of our aviation warfighters, with their 
invaluable, irreplaceable skill sets and leadership.

3.  AC ADHRB:
    a.  Capable and dedicated department heads are vital to mission 
effectiveness, and represent the important link between senior leadership and 
junior personnel.  In response to direct feedback from the fleet, the AC 
ADHRB has undergone substantial reform. Affected ADHRB elements include 
changes to eligibility criteria to recognize merit, introduction of variable 
obligations to provide flexibility, and a monetary incentive to commit early.  
Amounts offered are varied by type model series and designator (T/M/S+D), 
based on available inventory and billet requirements.
    b.  The AC ADHRB eligibility criterion has shifted from expiration of 
winging Active Duty Service Obligation (ADSO) to selection for lieutenant 
commander (LCDR).  The FY-18 ADHRB (not to be confused with the FY-18 ADSO 
Cohort ADHRB Program) is intended for officers selected for promotion to LCDR 
in the FY-18 LCDR statutory board and being considered for department head in 
the FY-19 Aviation Department Head Screen Board (ADHSB) scheduled to convene 
30 April 2018.  Consult the FY-18 ADHRB program information for eligibility 
and payment limitations based on the year of ADSO expiration.  Eligibility 
begins with the release of this NAVADMIN and closes on 31 August 2018.
    c.  Contracts are offered with either a 3 or 5-year obligation that 
begins upon expiration of the winging ADSO or contract approval of the 
officer, whichever is later.  The intent is to provide flexibility when 
making career decisions and to encourage officers to fulfill the department 
head tour and continue naval service.
    d.  The Navy values an early commitment and a 5-year obligation. An 
officer who submits a 5-year contract prior to the ADHSB results being 
published will receive the maximum annual rate specific to their T/M/S+D.  
If an officer prefers a 3-year contract, or wishes to wait until the ADHSB 
selection/slate results are public, the ADHRB annual amount reduces by $5,000 
per year.  Due to the shift in eligibility criteria, all NFOs considered for 
the FY-19 ADHSB who are currently under contract or who were eligible for a 
previous AvB program, are not eligible for the program this year.
    e.  AC ADHRB retention bonus pay rates for FY-18 include:
5-year obligation, early rate:
HM Pilot	$35,000/year ($175,000 total)
HSC Pilot	$15,000/year ($75,000 total)
HSM Pilot	$25,000/year ($125,000 total)

4.  AC ACRB
    a.  As with the AC ADHRB, the AC ACRB is designed to retain those 
officers with the talent and command experience in our primary warfighting 
missions that are critical for the future of our service.  Our cadre of 
commander (CDR) commanding officers (CO) lead our Naval Aviation Enterprise 
today, and they are the major commanders and flag officers of tomorrow.  
Their skills and leadership experience are essential to the success of the 
Navy.  The FY-18 ACRB incentivizes their continued service in follow-on 
assignments requiring senior aviation leaders.
     b.  ACRB applicants must be screened as CO of an eligible Operational 
(OP), Operational Training (OP-T), or Special Mission (SM) CDR command in 
order to apply.  Eligible commands are those for which the annual Aviation 
Command Screen Board selects officers to serve as CO, excluding second-in-
grade/sequential/bonus/Fleet Replacement Squadron commands.  Consult the FY-
18 ACRB program information for specific eligibility criteria and 
limitations. Eligibility begins with the release of this NAVADMIN and closes 
on 31 August 2018.
     c.  All FY-18 ACRB contracts will be worth $100,000.  All eligible 
officers will receive an initial payment of $34,000 and two anniversary 
payments of $33,000.  Participation in the FY-18 ACRB obligates contractees 
to three years of obligated service to include full completion of a post 
command commander tour, which may be between 24 and 36 months depending on 
assignment.  ACRB obligation ends at the completion of 22 years of service or 
projected rotation date (PRD) of the assigned post command CDR tour, 
whichever is later.  ACRB applications for those currently under ADHRB 
obligations, will be accepted, held in abeyance, and activated upon ADHRB 
contract expiration.
     d.  The FY-17 ACRB has been extended for 60 days from the release of 
this NAVADMIN for individuals who served as CO of an eligible OP, OP-T, or SM 
O-5 command in FY-17, and who did not sign a contract during the FY-17 
program.  Individuals who served as CO in FY-17 are only eligible to apply 
for the terms and conditions of the FY-17 program and applications must be 
received by the Assistant Aviation Officer Community Manager (PERS-435) 
within 60 days from release of this NAVADMIN.

5.  Additional AvB Information:
     a.  Officers accepting AvB contracts are not precluded from 
participating in the Career Intermission Program (CIP).  Officers interested 
in both AvB and CIP should contact the AvB program manager and their detailer 
for more information.
    b.  For further AvB details, eligibility, and application procedures, 
visit the Navy Personnel Command Aviation Bonus website at 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/detailing/aviation/ocm/pages/accp.aspx

6.  AC and RC AvIP:
    a.  In addition to the AvB, AvIP compensates naval officers for frequent 
and regular performance of operational or proficiency flying duty authorized 
in line with reference (a), and is intended to attract and retain both AC and 
RC officers in a military aviation career.
    b.  As authorized in reference (a), effective 1 April 2018, the Navy is 
establishing expanded AvIP rates for aviators who screen for and serve in 
administrative milestone billets.  Administrative milestone billets are 
designated as department head, commander command, and major command (or 
equivalent).  The baseline and administrative milestone rates are as follows 
based on years of active service (YAS):
Baseline AvIP
YAS             Monthly Rate
2 or Less       $125
Over 2          $156
Over 3          $188
Over 4          $206
Over 6          $650
Over 10         $650
Over 14         $840
Over 22         $585
Over 23         $495
Over 24         $385
Over 25         $250
Administrative Milestone AvIP
YAS              Monthly Rate
2 or Less        $125
Over 2           $156
Over 3           $188
Over 4           $206
Over 6           $650
Over 10          $1000
Over 22          $700
Over 24          $450
    c.  Administrative milestone screened Aviators in the AC, Full Time 
Support, and the Selected Reserve will receive the rate increase beginning 
the 15 April 2018 payday.  Selective Reserve Aviators will receive the rate 
increase beginning with paid periods of Annual Training, Inactive Duty 
Training, or Drills that occur on or after 1 April 2018.
    d.  Administrative milestone AvIP rates are only available to aviation 
officers with 131X, 132X, and 15XX designators who are selected for career 
administrative milestones through the aviation administrative screen board 
process and meet the AvIP eligibility requirements in references (a) and (b).  
All other aviation officers will be compensated with the baseline AvIP rates 
so long as they meet AvIP eligibility requirements in references (a) and (b).
    e.  Administrative milestone AvIP rates will be maintained until the 
aviation officer:  (1) fails to select for the next aviation screen board 
administrative milestone, (2) declines a career administrative milestone 
assignment, or (3) is relieved of administrative milestone billet duties 
(service member misconduct, detach for cause, loss of confidence, etc.).  
Upon receiving any one of these statuses, the aviation officer will be 
compensated with the baseline AvIP rates, if eligible.
    f.  PERS-43 is responsible for overseeing the proper implementation of 
AvIP under these guidelines and shall be the final adjudication authority in 
resolving questions as to whether an aviator should receive AvIP at the 
baseline or milestone rates.
    g.  Flight gate requirements remain unchanged.  References (a) and (b) 
contain AvIP requirements and eligibility criteria.
