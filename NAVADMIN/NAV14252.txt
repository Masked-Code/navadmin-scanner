RMKS/1. This NAVADMIN provides notice and information regarding the 2015 
VITA/ELF program. This message supersedes reference (a).

2. The VITA/ELF program is managed by Naval Legal Service Command to provide 
free electronic tax filing services for Sailors, dependents, and retirees 
with a focus on assisting Service members E6 and below.
Commercial tax preparers charge over $170 for an average electronically-filed 
return. Last year, fleet volunteers helped thousands of Service members and 
dependents avoid paying tax preparation fees. In fact, in tax year 2013, 
volunteers with the program saved Service members and dependents an estimated 
$800,000.00 in tax preparation fees and provided over 10 million dollars in 
expedited tax refunds.

3. This program reduces the effort and cost involved in preparing and filing 
federal and state tax returns.
   a. Volunteers assist Sailors and dependents at no cost.
   b. Refunds are deposited an average of two weeks from the date oF filing, 
reducing the lure of commercial refund anticipation loans which have high 
interest rates and fees.

4. Self-service tax preparation, using free tax filing software, is available 
to all Sailors, dependents, and retirees to file their tax returns at the 
continental U.S.
and outside of the continental U.S. tax centers. Tax centers are staffed by 
IRS trained and certified volunteers to assist with tax filing.

5. Commands must ensure Sailors are aware of their personal responsibility to 
file tax returns and that free Navy services are available to them.

6. Tax assistance centers depend on local commands for personnel, equipment, 
and facilities. This program merits serious consideration in every command's 
allocation of manpower and resources and is a particularly good use of 
talented limited duty Sailors.
   a. Commands are encouraged to identify Sailors who can work as volunteers 
full or part-time at tax centers.
   b. Volunteers require training in advance of assignment to a tax center. 
Volunteers will be advised of training sessions by tax center managers prior 
to execution of duties.
Commands that can provide Sailors as VITA/ELF volunteers should contact their 
local Regional Legal Servicing Office as soon as possible. Regional Legal 
Servicing Office contact information can be accessed at the following web
address: WWW.JAG.NAVY.MIL/LEGAL_SERVICES/LEGAL_SERVICES_
LOCATOR_RLSO.HTM.
   c. Commands interested in setting up their own program should contact LT 
Peter Marx at the Office of the Judge Advocate General (Code 16) at (202) 
685-4637 DSN: 325-4637 or PETER.MARX(AT)NAVY.MIL.
