Online (BOL) and NPC Document Services for online EVAL and FITREP drafting, 
routing, review and submission. 
 
3.  eNavFit enables Sailors to draft, edit, electronically route and 
digitally sign performance evaluations with electronic submission to the 
Sailors Official Military Personnel File in a matter of days. The 
functionality of eNavFit will improve report accuracy, timeliness and quality

delays.  Reference (b) includes the policy for eNavFit. 
 
4.  eNavFit has been designed for the following operational 
conditions

reports via BOL. 
    c.  Disconnected operations.  For commands entirely offline with legacy 
ability to print, wet sign and mail completed reports to NPC. 
 
5.  Maximum use of eNavFit by active component commands is highly encouraged 
starting 15 February 2022. 
 
6.  Performance evaluation training materials including an eNavFit user 
guide, video tutorials and quick reference cards can be found via the NPC 
website at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Performance-
Evaluation/eNAVFIT/. 
 
7.  For questions concerning eNavFit, contact the MyNavy Career Center at
