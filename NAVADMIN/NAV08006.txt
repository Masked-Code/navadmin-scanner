SUBJ/RELIGIOUS PROGRAM SPECIALIST (RP) RATING 29TH ANNIVERSARY// 
RMKS/1. 15 JANUARY 2008 MARKS THE 29TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RELIGIOUS 
PROGRAM SPECIALIST (RP) RATING.
THIS OCCASION PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF 
RELIGIOUS PROGRAM SPECIALISTS WHO FAITHFULLY SERVE OUR NATION.
2. RELIGIOUS PROGRAM SPECIALISTS ARE A CRITICAL LINK IN SUPPORTING OUR 
SAILORS, MARINES, AND THEIR FAMILIES. 
THE RP RATING INSIGNIA SPEAKS OF THEIR MISSION:  THE COMPASS, WHICH 
SUGGESTS THE DIRECTION WHICH RELIGION GIVES TO LIFE; THE GLOBE, WHICH 
SYMBOLIZES WORLDWIDE MINISTRY OUTREACH; AND THE ANCHOR, WHICH INDICATES 
THAT RELIGIOUS SUPPORT IS PROVIDED CONTINUALLY FOR SEA SERVICE 
PERSONNEL AND THEIR FAMILIES.

THE RP RATING A HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
