SUBJ/MILITARY SPOUSE APPRECIATION DAY 2019//

RMKS/1.  Military Spouse Appreciation Day is 10 May 2019, a day when we 
officially recognize the contributions spouses play in serving alongside 
their loved ones.  As we take a moment to honor the contributions and 
sacrifices made by military spouses and families, we recognize how their 
selfless support enables us to focus on the mission at hand.

2.  As part of a larger effort to recognize the contributions Navy Spouses 
and families make to our Navy’s mission success, the Navy is launching the 
MyNavy Family application to coincide with Military Spouse Appreciation Day.  
The MyNavy Family application was developed with the support of more than 
1,100 spouses who provided feedback and suggestions.  The application 
combines the strength of more than 22 websites to connect Navy spouses and 
families to information and resources when and where they need it regardless 
of how long they have been part of the Navy family.

3.  The launch of the MyNavy Family application supports the Navy Family 
Framework objective to expand and improve the experience for Navy spouses and 
families.  Other related efforts include improving family programs and 
websites, developing an official MyNavy Family website, providing Ombudsman 
registry access to command leadership spouses and increasing the availability 
of live webinars and self- directed learning activities.  Additionally, next 
month we will release a new policy allowing reimbursement of up to $500 of 
spouse state licensure or certification costs arising from relocation from 
one state to another due to a permanent change of station move.

4.  The MyNavy Family application will be available for download via the Navy 
App Locker located on MyNavy Portal under quick links at 
https://my.navy.mil/quick-links.html, the Apple App Store and Google Play 
Store.

5.  Please take the time to show our spouses how much we appreciate them on 
10 May 2019.  This special day symbolizes the honor and respect we hold 
throughout the year for our spouses and the many contributions they make each 
day to our Navy and our nation.  Thank you all for your service.
