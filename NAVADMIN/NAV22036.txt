RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the establishment of the Surface Warfare 
Officer (SWO) Senior Officer Retention Bonus (SORB) for eligible SWOs. 
 
2.  Program Authority.  This program is authorized under section 332, Title 
37, U.S. Code.  In line with reference (a), the SWO SORB is effective through 
29 October 2024 unless otherwise rescinded or superseded.  All applications 
for the bonus contained within this program will be submitted to the SWO 
Assignments Division (PERS-41) for approval, payment processing and tracking. 
 
3.  Program Overview.  This message summarizes the provisions of the SWO 
SORB.  All information provided herein is applicable to both Active Component 
(AC) SWOs and Reserve Component (RC) Training and Administration of the 
Reserve (TAR) SWOs, except where otherwise noted.  The following general 
summary is provided: 
    a.  SWOs promoted to commander (CDR) and administratively screened for 
executive officer (XO)-special mission (SM), XO-afloat, commanding officer 
(CO)-SM, and CO-afloat who are serving in or completed milestone tours will 
have the opportunity to commit to the SWO SORB.  The Navy will pay qualified 
officers for four years of obligated service from the completion of the 19th 
year of commissioned service (YCS) to the completion of the 23rd YCS.  CDRs 
with at least 18 YCS, but not more than 19 YCS, are eligible for the SWO 
SORB.  AC SWOs will receive 12,000 dollars on the 19th, 20th, 21st and 22nd 
YCS anniversary.  In line with references (b) and (c), RC TAR SWOs will also 
receive 12,000 dollars on the 19th, 20th, 21st and 22nd YCS anniversary. 
    b.  References (b) and (c) limit career retention bonus amounts. 
While officers may receive multiple retention bonuses under section 332, 
Title 37, U.S. Code, over a career, total bonus payments under this authority 
may not exceed 300,000 dollars for AC officers and 150,000 dollars for RC 
officers. 
 
4.  Program Eligibility 
    a.  Must meet all four of the following requirements: 
        (1) Qualified and serving as an active duty SWO (designator 1110 or 
1117). 
        (2) Permanently appointed CDR. 
        (3) Have at least 18 YCS, but no more than 19 YCS. 
        (4) Administratively screened and serving in or completed a XO-SM, 
XO-afloat, CO-SM or CO-afloat milestone tour as assigned by PERS-41. 
    b.  If assigned to an at sea tour by PERS-41, eligible officers must be 
sea duty assignable as defined by reference (d). 
Additionally: 
        (1) An officer under contract assigned to an at-sea tour and 
evaluated as no longer fit for sea duty by an appropriate medical authority, 
following a period of temporary limited duty (TLD), will have a stop payment 
placed on their account and receive no further SWO SORB payments.  However, 
an officer on TLD who is reasonably expected by the assigned medical officer 
to make a full recovery and be found fit for sea duty will continue to 
receive scheduled payments.  This determination will be completed by PERS-41 
in line with the appropriate medical authority findings. 
        (2) An officer found unfit for continued naval service by an 
appropriate medical authority will have a stop payment placed on their 
account and receive no further SWO SORB payments. 
        (3) Should a previously ineligible officer later become fit for sea 
duty, payments will resume at normal intervals for the remainder of the 
anniversary payment(s).  Retroactive pay is not authorized for any bonus 
payments that were scheduled during the period the officer was ineligible. 
    c.  Career Intermission Program (CIP).  An officer participating in CIP 
will be ineligible to receive SORB payments during their time in the 
program.  Payments will resume upon return to service and in line with the 
payment scheme. 
    d.  Bonuses will be paid in line with the payment structure in  
paragraph 6. 
 
5.  Program Execution 
    a.  The SWO community manager is assigned as the program manager and is 
delegated the authority to administer the SWO SORB program according to 
applicable laws, Department of Defense directives/instructions and this 
NAVADMIN. 
    b.  PERS-41 receives applications submitted in the format referenced in 
paragraph 7.  PERS-41 is delegated the authority to: 
        (1) Evaluate eligibility of SWOs applying for the SWO SORB program. 
        (2) Approve SWO contracts to remain on active duty for the stated 
period in exchange for a SWO SORB. 
        (3) Administer SORB payments. 
    c.  All applications require written endorsement from their commander, CO 
or equivalent superior in charge. 
    d.  Officers under a SORB agreement are not eligible to apply for the 
permanent military professor (PMP) program or any redesignation programs that 
result in a designator change to any designator other than 1110 or 1117.  An 
officer under a SORB agreement may submit an application for PMP or any 
redesignation program once the date of application is within 12 months of the 
final day of bonus obligation. 
 
6.  SORB Payment Structure 
    a.  Applications for SORB must be submitted between the 18th and 19th 
YCS.  Approved applicants will receive payments on the 19th, 20th, 21st and

Navy (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) via PERS-41 before 1 June 2022 to be

officers would incur a service obligation completing four years.  Initial

7.  Application Process

        (1) Application format can be found on the PERS-41 page of the MyNavy 
HR at  https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
Management/Detailing/Officer/Pers-41-SWO/Pay-Incentives/. 
        (2) Applications will be binding upon the date of approval by

8.  Recoupment and Repayment Policy.  Repayment policy is governed by section 
373, Title 10, U.S. Code and reference (e).  A Service Member of the 
uniformed services who enters into a written agreement with specified service 
conditions for receipt of a bonus is entitled to the full amount of the bonus 
if the member fulfills the conditions of the written agreement.  If the 
member fails to fulfill the service conditions specified in the written 
agreement for the pay, then the pay may be terminated and the Service Member 
may be required to repay an amount equal to the unearned portion of the 
pay.  SWO SORB payments will be stopped for officers who become ineligible 
for this incentive or fail to complete the full period of additional 
obligated service. 
    a.  For officers who die while serving under a SWO SORB service 
agreement, the remaining SWO SORB balance will be paid as a lump sum as part 
of the settlement of the final military pay account of the officer.  If death 
is determined to be the result of the misconduct of the member, future 
payments will be stopped and unearned portions of the bonus will be recouped, 
as applicable, in line with procedures established for members whose 
inability to complete a contracted period of service is voluntary or the 
result of misconduct. 
    b.  Recoupment ETP determinations will be made by Director, Military 
Personnel Plans and Policy Division (OPNAV N13).
