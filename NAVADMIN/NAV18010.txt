SUBJ/2019 NAVY LEGISLATIVE FELLOWSHIP CALL FOR APPLICATIONS//

REF/A/DOC/BUPERS/12NOV10//
AMPN/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1560.21F, LEGISLATIVE FELLOWS PROGRAM.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits applications for the 2019 Navy Legislative 
Fellows Program.  The Legislative Fellows Program allows naval officers, 
senior enlisted and Department of the Navy civilians to broaden their 
understanding of the legislative process and the operation of the U.S. 
Congress through a year-long full-time assignment to the office of a member 
of the House of Representatives or the Senate.  The Legislative Fellows 
Program also enhances the ability of the Navy to fulfill its role in the 
national policy development process.

2.  This is a highly competitive program.  Records must reflect sustained 
superior performance and potential for future assignments in critical 
billets.  Upon completion of the program, officers earn an additional 
legislative qualification designator.  Additionally, there is an opportunity 
to earn a legislative studies certificate through a sponsoring agency.

3.  Military Applicants.  Participation is open to all Active Duty and Full-
Time Support unrestricted line officers, restricted line officers, and staff 
corps officers in the permanent grades of O-3 through O-5.  Enlisted 
participation is open to all Navy occupational specialty codes in the 
permanent grades of E-7 through E-9.  The selection process will focus on 
individual performance, promotion potential, academic and subspecialty 
qualifications, needs of the Navy and availability for follow-on assignment.  
Officers with permanent change of station orders already issued will not be 
considered.
    a.  Applicants must be available for permanent change of station 
assignment to Washington, DC, from November 2018 through December 2019.  
During the fellowship, officers and senior enlisted Sailors will be assigned 
to the Office of Legislative Affairs for administrative purposes.  Upon 
execution of orders, fellows agree to serve for 3 years following completion 
or termination of the fellowship.  A follow-on utilization tour in 
legislative affairs is preferred (making career timing an important 
consideration), but depends on community-specific billet requirements, needed 
officer progression and availability of legislative assignments.  All officer 
applicants must contact their detailers for counseling on the career impact 
of participation in the Legislative Fellowship Program.
    b.  Submit applications via email to the Office of Legislative Affairs 
point of contact no later than 31 March 2018.  Program information and 
submission guidance is available on the Navy Legislative Affairs website at
http://www.navy.mil/local/ola/legislative_fellowship1.asp.
