NARR/REF A IS DOD INSTRUCTION 1300.19, DOD JOINT OFFICER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.  
REF B IS UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MEMORANDUM FOR CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT 
CHIEFS OF STAFF.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces a one-time exception to policy involving 
requests for joint experience credit more than 12 months after experience 
completion.

2.  Reference (a) allows joint duty credit to be granted to an officer for 
either completion of a tour of duty in a joint duty assignment list position 
or the accrual of joint experience points based on joint experiences 
recognized by Joint Qualification System (JQS) Experience Panels as providing 
officers with an equivalent of experience in joint matters.  The instruction 
requires officers to submit requests for joint duty experience credit within 
12 months of the requested joint experiences completion date.  There has been 
a request to consider a one-time, exception to policy (ETP) for the 12-month 
time constraint to allow certain officers to request joint duty experience 
credit for experiences that concluded over 12 months ago.

3.  Reference (b) authorizes a one-time ETP for a panel to evaluate joint 
experiences outside of the defined 12-month deadline found in reference (a).  
This panel will consider officers from all services, active and reserve, who 
are serving in the grade of O-6 or O-5 on the date of reference (b).  This 
panel will only consider experiences gained after 1 October 2010, and the 
experiences covered may not have been previously reviewed by a JQS Experience 
Panel. Any experience not approved by this JQS Experience Review Panel may 
not be resubmitted for reconsideration by subsequent JQS Experience Review 
Panels.

4.  This one-time ETP panel is scheduled to convene in conjunction with the 
regularly scheduled JQS panel in February 2016; therefore, all nominations 
(ETP and regular submissions) are due no later than 15 January 2016.  
Officers may self-nominate their joint experiences through the JQS self-
nomination website, located at https:// 
www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/jmis/JQSindex.jsp.  Officers should check the NPC 
website: http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/Detailing/jointofficer/Pages/JQSE-JDASelfNomination.aspx for 
current information on scheduling and due dates for submissions. Lessons 
learned from past JQS review panels can be found on the NPC web site as well.
