RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supports references (a) through (c) and announces the 
assignment optimization plan for active and full time support component 
master chief petty officers (MCPOs) and senior chief petty officers (SCPOs).  
Commander, Navy Personnel Command
(COMNAVPERSCOM) (PERS-40) will work with the fleet readiness integrators 
(FRI), type commanders (TYCOM) and budget submitting office (BSO) N1 staffs 
to evaluate all MCPOs and SCPOs assigned to billets with incorrect paygrades 
or those who are not aligned to funded billet requirements.  The goal of this 
optimization plan is to ensure our most experienced enlisted Sailors are 
aligned to billets which specifically need their training, leadership and 
experience.  This plan will lead to the realignment of MCPOs and SCPOs into 
billets appropriate to their skills.
2.  COMNAVPERSCOM will host a virtual senior enlisted manning summit in 
Millington, TN from 13 to 17 September 2021.  Summit attendance will be 
governed by the applicable health protection condition restrictions, see 
local guidance for specifics.  During registration for the summit, attendees 
have and will be provided with specific risk mitigation instructions.  The 
aim of this summit will be to review all MCPO and SCPO assignments, with the 
goal of aligning the maximum number of master chiefs to master chief billets 
and senior chiefs to senior chief billets.  This summit will allow Fleets and 
TYCOMs to work with NPC to fill their most impactful gapped billets.
    a.  PERS-4013 has provided a list of misaligned MCPOs and SCPOs to the 
FRIs on 3 September 2021.  The FRIs have distributed the list of misaligned 
Sailors to the TYCOM and BSO N1s.  Prior to the enlisted manning summit, 
PERS-4013 will evaluate MCPO and SCPO billet requirements in MyNavy 
Assignment (MNA), and if the billets are filled by Sailors outside of the 
billet paygrade, the incumbent may be realigned to an in-paygrade requirement 
or placed in excess onboard the current command.  This will ensure that 
personnel assignment stakeholders have a clear demand signal of valid MCPO 
and SCPO requirements.  After the completion of the summit, if MCPOs and 
SCPOs are identified for movement, PERS-4013 will submit personnel manning 
action request (PMAR) in MNA.  If there are no near term movements required, 
Sailors may have their projected rotation date
(PRD) adjusted to enter the order negotiation window earlier than their 
current PRD.
        (1) MCPOs and SCPOs who have their PRD adjusted will be considered a 
sea or shore roller based on a ratio of sea and shore duty billets available 
within their paygrade.
        (2) MCPOs and SCPOs should expect to negotiate for orders to fill an 
in-paygrade requirement in all follow on assignments.
    b.  Enlisted manning stakeholders identified in paragraph 1 shall review 
misaligned personnel, as well as fleet billet vacancies, and provide their 
recommendations for action at the manning summit.
    c.  Fleet readiness concerns will guide all decisions and actions, but 
each move will be considered on a case by case basis to minimize impacts to 
our Sailors and families.
    d.  The movement of realigned personnel will begin in early fiscal year 
2022.
3.  The summit precept requires participants to maintain integrity without 
prejudice or partiality for all Sailors evaluated.  Each participant must pay 
particular attention to each Sailor and billet to ensure that they are 
meeting the intention of senior enlisted optimization.  During deliberations, 
participants may discuss any negative impacts a realignment may have on the 
command or the Sailor.  Before any decisions are made, TYCOM/BSO and FRIs 
will provide their input.  If the requested actions are within one FRI, the 
FRI will make final decisions.  If the requested action involves more than 
one FRI and there is a disagreement, the Manning Control Authority will make 
the final decision.  A copy of the precept will be provided to the 
participants by the summit coordinators.
4.  Fleet activities shall continue evaluating MNA alignments to ensure that 
Sailors are accurately aligned onboard the current activity.  Master and 
senior chief petty officers should be aligned to billets for their specific 
paygrades.  If Sailors of any paygrade need to be realigned to another 
billet, the command activity manning manager (AMM) should submit a member 
realignment request (MRR) in MNA.  If the MRR is approved, PERS-4013 will 
update the alignment.
AMMs should reach out to their command placement coordinator in
PERS-4013 with any issues, questions or concerns.
5.  Key messages:
    a.  Sailors.  We are working to better align our enlisted supervisors to 
billets which require their skills.  The emphasis on operational readiness 
and unit prioritization reflect our identity as a sea service.  We must 
preserve the readiness of the Fleet and ensure that senior enlisted leaders 
are optimally assigned to meet mission readiness.  We will take each Sailors 
personal considerations into account, but I know that this may induce 
additional hardship for some Sailors and their families, and I thank you and 
them for your service and sacrifice.
    b.  Commands.  Commanders, commanding officers, executive officers and 
command master chiefs must ensure their Sailors understand the intent of this 
message.
