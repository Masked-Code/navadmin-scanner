RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Navy and Marine Corps Air Traffic 
Control (ATC) Leadership Continuum to be held in Myrtle Beach, SC from 25-27 
April 2017.  This is an official training event designed for Navy and Marine 
Corps ATC leadership and management.

2.  This forum provides senior air traffic control managers a venue to 
educate and train on Federal Aviation Regulations, Naval Air Training and 
Operating Procedures Standardization, facility management, manpower 
management, technical advances, operational enhancements, unmanned flight 
operations, and policy changes occurring in the ATC profession.  Topics to be 
discussed:  updates to Naval Aviation; special use airspace, to include 
scheduling, encroachment, and authority; Naval Air Systems Command Program
Manager Air update on equipment and budgets; Navy and Marine Corps manning 
and manpower; detailer and monitor briefs; Type Command community updates

issues; management of the National Airspace System; and United States

3.  Navy and Marine Corps ATC leadership participation from expeditionary 
units, facilities ashore, and afloat is critical in order to effectively 
address Federal Aviation Administration, International Civil Aviation 
Organization, and naval ATC policy and procedures which directly affect 
safety, training, and operational readiness.

the Navy managers who desire to make a presentation should contact CDR Jeff

should be minimized by limiting attendees to ATC Officers, Leading Chief
