SUBJ/D-DAY 80TH ANNIVERSARY MESSAGE TO THE FLEET// 
 
RMKS/1.  Eighty years ago, off the shores of Normandy, Allied forces 
launched the pivotal invasion that would change the course of World 
War II in Europe.  Today, Operation Overlord, known as D-Day, remains 
a testament to the bravery and selfless sacrifice of our Sailors, 
Marines, and all who stood and fought for freedom. 
 
2.  The significance of D-Day cannot be overstated.  It marked the 
beginning of the end of Nazi tyranny in Europe and paved the way for 
the liberation of millions.  The coordinated efforts of Allied forces 
demonstrated the strength of unity and determination in the face of 
terror and oppression.  In the existential fight between freedom and 
tyranny, freedom carried the day on the beaches of Normandy due to 
the daring initiative, raw courage, and indomitable will to win of 
the junior-most Soldiers and Sailors, even in the face of staggering 
losses. 
 
3.  On this solemn anniversary, we pay tribute to the courage and 
resilience of those who stormed the beaches under heavy fire and 
faced unimaginable challenges, with many making the ultimate 
sacrifice.  Their unwavering commitment to the ideals of liberty and 
democracy and willingness to put their lives on the line for others 
embody the finest traditions of our Navy and Marine Corps. 
 
4.  In commemoration of the 80th anniversary of D-Day today, let us 
reaffirm our commitment to upholding the principles for which they 
fought.  Freedom prevailed at Normandy because an alliance of 
nations beholden to their citizens proved stronger than one nation 
with allegiance to one man.  The cost of freedom was incredibly high 
on 6 June 1944, and we must never forget the sacrifice of those who 
gave their today for our tomorrow.  May we strive to be worthy heirs 
of their legacy, and even more dedicated to preserving the peace, 
responding in crisis, and winning decisively in war for future 
generations. 
 
5.  Released by ADM L. M. Franchetti, Chief of Naval Operations and 
MCPON J. Honea, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy.
