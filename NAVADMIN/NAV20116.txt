RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and in line with references (b) 
and (c) extends the ongoing stop movement travel restrictions to 30 June 
2020.  In addition, this NAVADMIN provides clarifying guidance on other 
COVID-19 related issues and policy changes, contains measures to mitigate the 
spread of COVID-19 throughout the Navy enterprise and amplifies DoD and DoN 
direction for Navy Service Members and Navy civilians.  It summarizes and
repeats applicable guidance where appropriate to serve as a one-stop 
information source.  This NAVADMIN does not cancel or supersede Combatant 
Commander (COCOM) guidance for forces assigned or allocated to that COCOM or 
within that COCOM Area of Responsibility (AOR).  Authorized travelers will 
adhere to the Force Health Protection Guidance (FHPG) as detailed throughout 
references (a) through (aw) as summarized in this NAVADMIN and later 
guidance.
The following circumstances are exempt from travel restrictions (i.e., 
authorized without a waiver (previously referred to as an exception)):  
(1) Travel associated with uniformed personnel recruiting and accessions 
activities, to include accessions, basic training, advanced individual 
training and follow-on travel to the first duty station.  
(2) Travel by patients (to include those on the Temporary Disability Retired 
List (TDRL)), as well as their authorized escorts and attendants, for 
purposes of medical treatment.  Travel by medical providers for the purposes 
of medical treatment for DoD personnel and their family members is also
authorized.  
(3) Travel for Global Force Management (GFM) activities (defined as 
deployments/redeployments ordered in the GFM Allocation Plan (GFMAP) and 
COCOM Assigned Force Demand Tasking, including Service internal rotations to 
support and TDY used to source ordered capabilities).  Such travel to execute 
Operations, Activities, and Investments or Service-related training will be 
coordinated between the COCOM, the Joint Staff (JS) and the appropriate 
Military Department.  All GFM-scheduled deployments/redeployments of U.S.
Navy vessels and embarked units and personnel are authorized, provided they 
are in-transit and have met the 14-day Restriction of Movement (ROM) provided 
for under reference (q) and any applicable subsequent guidance.  
(4) Travel authorized by the Commander, U.S. Transportation Command 
(USTRANSCOM), to continue execution of the Joint Deployment and Distribution 
Enterprise as required to project and sustain the Joint Force globally.  This 
includes forces (aircrews, vessel crews and mission essential personnel) 
ordered on prepare-to-deploy orders alert status, air refueling, global 
patient movement, mortuary affairs support, inland surface, sea and air 
sustainment missions, support to other U.S. Agencies (as approved by SECDEF) 
and moves of personnel and equipment that support USTRANSCOM global posture 
requirements.  
(5) Travel by individuals pending retirement or separation.  
(6) Travel by those under authority of a Chief of Mission and authorized by 
that Chief of Mission.
    1.A.  Background.  The DoD has transitioned to Phase Three (Respond) of 
reference (e), the global campaign in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.  Our 
workforce is our first line of defense.  All hands must proactively take 
action to ensure the health of our force and to ensure we mitigate the spread 
of COVID-19 in order to maintain our readiness.  During the COVID-19 
outbreak, the DoD and DoN will continue to protect and preserve the 
operational effectiveness of forces worldwide in accordance with (IAW) 
references (e) and (f).  Utilizing FHPG from the USD P&R provided in 
references (g) and (q), USNORTHCOM is executing its pandemic plan and 
geographic COCOMs are executing their supporting pandemic plans IAW reference 
(h).  In compliance with USD P&R FHPG issued in references (i) and (j), the 
Office of the Chief Naval Operations (OPNAV) published initial reporting 
guidance supporting DoD response to the COVID-19 outbreak in reference (k) 
and updated that guidance in references (a), (l) and (m).
    1.B.  Role of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).  As the leading U.S. 
government Public Health Agency, the CDC continues to assess the risk of 
COVID-19 and provide guidance for those residing in the U.S. and traveling 
abroad.  Because CDC guidance is principally tailored for persons residing in 
the U.S., some CDC COVID-19 guidance may have limited applicability for 
commanders, particularly those outside the U.S. and is not recognized by 
other sovereign nations.  While DoD continues to follow the lead of the
CDC, when needed, additional military specific measures are authorized to 
mitigate risk to U.S. forces stationed or deployed around the world and to 
protect Service Members, Navy civilian employees and their family members.  
USD P&R FHPG issued in reference (q) provides guidance for DoD personnel 
traveling during the novel coronavirus outbreak.
    1.C.  CDC Travel Health Advisories.  The CDC provides travel health 
advisories at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html.  
The Advisory Levels are noted below (note that CDC warning levels DO NOT 
apply to the U.S.):
Level 1  Watch, practice usual precautions (risk of limited community 
transmission)
Level 2  Alert, practice enhanced precautions (sustained (ongoing) community 
transmission)
Level 3  Warning, avoid nonessential travel (widespread sustained (ongoing) 
transmission)
As of the date of this NAVADMIN, a world-wide Level 3 travel advisory is in 
effect.
    1.D.  DoN Civilian Guidance.  The DoN civilian workforce more than 
220,000 strong plays an integral role in supporting our Sailors and building, 
manning and maintaining our ships, aircraft and submarines.  Working shoulder 
to shoulder with our Service Members, it is imperative to have alignment 
between Navy civilian and military COVID-19 policy and guidance.  DoN 
civilian guidance is contained in references (r) and (t) as well as this 
NAVADMIN.
    1.E.  Military Health Protection Guidance.  The SECDEF provided explicit 
FHPG in references (g), (q), (ap) and (aq) which is more restrictive than CDC 
guidance.  Commanders must read all documents in their entirety and ensure 
they are following the actions spelled out in this guidance.  Local 
commanders can be more restrictive based on command location, local community 
transmission, risk to mission and risk to force.  Each and every Sailor must 
ensure they proactively manage and minimize their personal risk to exposure 
and that of their families.  Commands are charged with ensuring they track 
and monitor each Sailor and aggressively follow SECDEF guidance in these 
references.

2.  Mission.  All commands will take specific actions to mitigate the spread 
of COVID-19 worldwide and adhere to the policies and reporting requirements 
contained in this NAVADMIN.

3.  Policy.  This NAVADMIN applies to all Navy uniformed and civilian 
personnel and their sponsored family members (not under the responsibility of 
a U.S. Chief of Mission).  In order to maintain force health protection, 
readiness of the force and mitigate the risk of transmission among personnel, 
on 20 April 2020, SECDEF issued reference (b), a world-wide stop movement, 
which incorporated and cancelled references (s), (u) and (w).  SECNAV then 
issued reference (c) which supersedes the portions of reference (r) regarding 
travel restrictions and cancels reference (t).  In line with reference (b) 
and (c), all Service Members will stop movement, both internationally and 
domestically.  All Navy civilians and dependents of Navy civilians and 
Service Members whose travel is government-funded will stop movement, both 
internationally and domestically.  Except as detailed in paragraph 1. above, 
this stop movement order applies to all official travel, including but not 
limited to, temporary duty (TDY) travel, government-funded leave travel, 
Permanent Change of Station (PCS) travel and travel related to Authorized 
Departures (AD) and Ordered Departures issued by the Department of State 
(DoS).  It also includes personal leave outside the local area and non-
official travel outside of the local area for Navy Service Members.  All 
personnel should follow federal, state and local direction, as well as 
direction from their chain of command, including Stay at Home orders, 
maximizing telework and practicing social distancing.  Reference (y) provides 
additional guidance on state and local executive orders and COVID-19 
response.
Service Members are only authorized local leave, subject to guidance on 
authorized waivers in paragraph 3E.  Until the travel restrictions prescribed 
above are lifted, Navy civilian hiring actions for positions in domestic or 
international locations remain postponed for non-essential civilian personnel 
who had not begun travel as of 13 March 2020.  Navy commands may only 
gain/onboard civilian employees within the local commuting area, including 
civilian employees whose travel to the local commuting area is not 
government-funded as well as civilian employees who have been approved for 
situational telework.
    3.A.  PCS.  Service Members, Navy civilians and dependents under
PCS orders will follow the guidance in section 3.A. of this NAVADMIN.
          3.A.1.  PCS orders to all locations for Service Members.
Service Members and their dependents under PCS orders will stop movement. 
Execution of PCS orders requires a waiver IAW paragraph 3.E.
                  3.A.1.a.  Service Members who have detached from their 
parent command prior to the date of this NAVADMIN and are in transit are 
directed to contact Navy Personnel Command (NPC) for follow-on guidance per 
paragraph 5.A.  NPC is standing by to address each specific case and will 
authorize entitlements based on current location and situation.
                  3.A.1.b.  Detaching and gaining commands shall make every 
effort to contact affected Service Members enroute to/from their command to 
advise them of the contents of this message.
          3.A.2. A local PCS move may be executed without a waiver since it 
does not involve travel outside of the local area.  To be clear, same 
geographic location PCS moves will only be executed with due regard to the 
operational readiness of the commands involved.
Losing and gaining commands are encouraged to coordinate with placement 
coordinators and detailers in PERS-4 as required.  PERS-4 shall adjudicate 
same geographic location PCS move decisions in situations where losing and 
gaining commands do not agree on an execution timeline.  This adjudication 
may be delegated, but no lower than the O-6 Division Director level at 
PERS-4.
                    3.A.3.  PCS orders for Navy civilians.  All DoN civilian 
employees (and if applicable their command-sponsored dependents) whose 
transportation is government-funded will stop movement.  Navy commands may 
continue civilian hiring actions, but may only onboard civilian employees in 
the local commuting area, including civilian employees whose travel to the 
local commuting area is not government-funded as well as civilian employees 
who have been approved for situational telework.  Contact your supervisory 
chain of command for further guidance.
    3.B.  Other Official Travel (Meetings, Conferences, Site Visits, etc.).  
All other official travel by Service Members and Navy civilians is prohibited 
and will require a waiver IAW paragraph 3.E. Navy Reserve personnel will 
follow guidance promulgated by the Chief of Navy Reserve (CNR) in reference 
(at).
    3.C.  Travel for Official Training.
          3.C.1.  Service Members and Navy civilians traveling to attend 
formal training will require a waiver IAW paragraph 3.E. prior to travel, 
will require advance coordination with the training command and will comply 
with Navy Component Commander (NCC) guidance concerning pre- and post- travel 
medical screening and reception procedures to include ROM if applicable.
          3.C.2.  Service Members and Navy civilians currently executing PCS 
or TDY orders and attending training and/or schools will complete their 
current training and/or school.  For those on TDY orders, Service Members and 
Navy civilians are directed to contact the command that issued the orders for 
returning instructions/guidance.  Navy civilians executing PCS orders are 
directed to contact the command that issued the orders for further guidance.  
Service Members executing PCS orders are directed to contact NPC for guidance 
and potential orders modification.  Once the current school/training is 
complete, Service Members should expect to take one of the following actions:  
(1) Return to their previous Permanent Duty Station (PDS), 
(2) Remain at the school/training site if prudent for health protection, 
(3) If the next school/training is in the same location and the course is 
still being offered, continue training.  Reevaluate after school/training 
completion or 
(4) Proceed to the ultimate PDS.  Decisions will be based on force health 
protection considerations.  Throughout the process, Service Members should 
consult with their affected command (current, losing or future) as well as 
their detailer where applicable.
          3.C.3.  Naval Education and Training Command (NETC) Learning 
Centers will continue to support Fleet mission essential training to the 
maximum extent possible while minimizing risk to force and balancing risk to 
mission (strictly abiding by CDC, DoD and Bureau of Medicine and Surgery 
(BUMED) guidance in the classroom/trainer environment).  For all training, 
there must be a two factor approach when determining whether to convene a 
course/training.  First, a deliberate evaluation should be conducted on 
whether the course/training should be convened based on its measureable 
impact to Force Generation (Fg) and Force Employment (Fe) and second, a 
deliberate evaluation should be conducted as to whether the course/training 
can be conducted while still adhering to current FHPG.  For those mission 
essential courses where CDC, DoD and BUMED guidance cannot be adhered to 
(physical nature of training, team simulators, firefighting/damage control 
trainers, etc.) Type Commanders (TYCOMS) should evaluate the necessity of 
each individual training requirement in light of the risk to force.
   3.D.  Personal Leave and Liberty.  Commanding Officers (CO) and Officers 
in Charge (OIC) may authorize local leave IAW command policy for Service 
Members, which may be informed by local community conditions.  Leave or 
personal travel outside of the local area, as defined by COs and OICs, 
requires a waiver as outlined in paragraph 3.E.  
For those Service Members currently on leave, COs or OICs are delegated 
authority to terminate leave early or allow completion of leave as authorized 
based on location, duration and risk to Service Member.  For Navy civilians, 
approval or denial of civilian annual leave requests will be based on mission 
requirements.  While intended travel outside the local commuting area may be 
considered in determining impact to mission requirements, leave requests for 
Navy civilians cannot be denied solely because an employee is travelling 
outside of the local commuting area.  In line with reference (t) paragraph 
3(b), Navy civilian employees are strongly encouraged to avoid personal leave 
outside of the local area.  Upon return from approved leave outside the local 
area, Navy civilians may be asked to telework or exercise leave options as 
appropriate.
  3.E.  Waivers.
          3.E.1.  Waivers to this directive may be granted in writing in 
cases where the travel is (1) determined to be mission essential, (2) 
necessary for humanitarian reasons or (3) warranted due to extreme hardship.  
Mission-essential travel refers to work that must be performed to ensure the 
continued operations of mission essential functions, including positions that 
are deemed key and essential, as determined by the waiver approval authority.  
Waivers are to be executed on a case-by-case basis, as determined to be in 
the best interest of the U.S. Government, and shall be coordinated between 
the gaining and losing organization.  All travel orders will be amended 
stating the waivers herein being granted.  Waivers granted in accordance with 
reference (a) are still valid.
          3.E.2.  COs and OICs may request a waiver via their chain of 
command to paragraphs 3.A. through 3.D.  
Approval authority for waivers belongs to the COCOM if the individual is 
assigned or allocated to a COCOM; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
(CJCS) if the individual is assigned to the JS; the Chief Management Officer 
(CMO) for personnel in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Defense 
Agencies, Defense Field Activities (and any other DoD entities not listed in 
this paragraph); and finally to the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) for 
personnel under his jurisdiction. Per reference (c), SECNAV has delegated 
this authority to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO).
                  3.E.2.a.  NPC (PERS-4) is delegated authority to approve or 
deny stop movement waivers for Service Member PCS travel in paragraphs 3.A. 
and 3.C.2.  Approvals of waiver requests shall be made via message traffic to 
all concerned and will specify whether dependents are authorized to accompany 
the Service Member.
Detaching commander endorsement is required up through the first Flag Officer 
or member of the Senior Executive Service (SES) or equivalent with authority 
to approve waivers per paragraph 3.E.2.b. Echelon 2 commanders will be 
notified of all PCS movements into and out of his/her area of responsibility.  
Upon receipt of an approved waiver, Transaction Service Center or Personnel 
Support Detachment/personnel offices will process the Service Member for 
transfer to the gaining command.  Send all waiver requests to 
pers451(at)navy.mil with the subject line PCS WAIVER REQUEST.
Waiver request formats will be provided by PERS-4 and posted on MyNavy Portal 
(MNP).  Service Members who are granted a waiver will receive guidance from 
NPC concerning NCC pre- and post- travel medical screening and reception 
procedures to include ROM.
                  3.E.2.b.  Authority to approve or deny stop movement 
waivers for Service Members in the case of:  (1) Official travel in paragraph 
3.B., and (2) Official training, not associated with a PCS, in paragraph 
3.C., and (3) Leave requests that include travel outside of the local area in 
paragraph 3.D, is delegated to the echelon 2 commander.  The echelon 2 
commander may further delegate waiver authority, but no lower than the first 
Flag Officer or SES or equivalent in the chain of command of the Service 
Member.
Those who are granted a waiver will comply with the echelon 2 guidance 
concerning pre- and post- travel screening and reception procedures.
                3.E.2.c.  Waivers for PCS of Navy civilians.
Authority to approve or deny waivers of the PCS of Navy civilians from 
outside the local commuting area in paragraphs 3.A. is delegated to the 
echelon 2 commander owning the billet.  The echelon 2 commander may further

equivalent in the chain of command of the command or activity performing the 
hiring action.  Those who are granted a waiver will comply with the echelon 2 
guidance concerning pre- and post- travel screening and reception procedures.
Echelon 2 commanders will be notified of all civilian PCS movements into and 
out of his/her area of responsibility.
                3.E.2.d.  Authority to approve or deny stop movement waivers 
for Navy civilians in the case of: (1) Official travel in paragraph 3.B. and 
(2) Official training, not associated with a PCS, in paragraph 3.C. is 
delegated to the echelon 2 commander.  The echelon 2 commander may further 
delegate waiver authority, but no lower than the first Flag Officer or SES or 
equivalent in the Service Member or Navy civilian employee chain of command.  
Those who are granted a waiver will comply with the echelon 2 guidance 
concerning pre- and post- travel screening and reception procedures.
    3.F.  Authorized and Ordered Departures.
          3.F.1.  USD P&R announced an Authorized Departure (AD) as outlined 
in reference (d) and modified in reference (x).  
In line with references (v) and (x), Navy Service Member eligible family 
members and DoN civilian employees who have determined they are at higher 
risk of a poor health outcome if exposed to COVID-19 or who have requested 
departure based on a commensurate justification in foreign areas  as well as 
a civilian employee and/or other eligible family members who may need to 
accompany them - are authorized by exception (waiver) only to depart their 
current duty station.  DoN civilian employees who wish to depart their duty 
station must consult with their chain of command.  
Per reference (x), approval authority for waivers belongs to the COCOM if the 
individual is assigned or allocated to a COCOM; the CJCS if the individual is 
assigned to the JS; the Secretary of the Military Department concerned for 
personnel under his/her jurisdiction; or the CMO for personnel in the OSD, 
Defense Agencies, Defense Field Activities and any other DoD entities not 
listed above.  Per reference (z), SECNAV delegated waiver approval authority 
for ADs and Ordered Departures (OD) to the CNO for personnel under the 
jurisdiction of the SECNAV.
Per this NAVADMIN, waiver approval authority is delegated to the echelon 2 
commander for personnel under the jurisdiction of the SECNAV.  The echelon 2 
commander may further delegate waiver authority, but no lower than the first 
Flag Officer or SES or equivalent in the chain of command of the command or 
activity of the individual departing.  Those who are granted a waiver will 
comply with the echelon 2 guidance concerning pre- and post- travel screening 
and reception procedures.
          3.F.2.  The designated safe-haven for departing Service Member 
eligible family members is the contiguous U.S.  The designated safe-haven for 
departing DoN civilian employees is the U.S., consisting of the 50 states and 
the District of Columbia. Members should work with their commands and local 
travel office to arrange for transportation to their safe-haven.  ADs are 
only permitted when appropriate transportation and reception procedures are 
in place consistent with reference (s).  Travelers should be aware that 
preventative health measures to include restricted movement and business 
closures have been implemented in the U.S. to various degrees by federal, 
state and local governments.  Travelers shall be advised to check the 
restrictions applicable to their situation, based on their departure 
location, any enroute locations (foreign and in the U.S.) and their ultimate 
safe-haven, as well as availability of lodging, prior to commencing travel.  
IAW the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), Chapter 6, dependents must designate 
their specific safe-haven location in the U.S. upon, or prior to, entry to 
the U.S.  Once designated, the specific safe-haven cannot be changed.  
Dependents of uniformed personnel will be processed for safe-haven allowances 
IAW with the JTR, Chapter 6, paragraph 0602.
DoN civilian employees and their eligible family members will be processed 
for allowances IAW with the JTR, Chapter 6, paragraph 0604.
          3.F.3.  It is strongly recommended that eligible family members and 
civilian employees after traveling, take the actions of paragraph 3.J.1. for 
the next 14 days.
          3.F.4.  The following provides general information for Service 
Member eligible family members regarding allowances. Members are advised that 
the impact of this AD on their specific allowances is highly dependent on 
member individual circumstances with specific allowances detailed in JTR, 
Chapter 6.  Members with questions should contact their nearest Personnel 
Support Detachment or MyNavy Career Center (MNCC).
                  3.F.4.a. Per diem:  Transportation expenses and travel per 
diem are authorized from the time the family departs the evacuation site, 
through the time they reach their selected safe-haven location in the 
continental U.S. including processing time at both the evacuation and 
receiving site.  A non-command-sponsored dependent is only authorized 
transportation and per diem.  Other allowances will not be paid.
                  3.F.4.b.  Escort allowances:  Travel and transportation 
allowances are also payable to a member, a U.S. government civilian employee 
or a person who travels under an official travel authorization/order as an 
escort for an evacuated dependent who is incapable of traveling alone to the 
safe-haven due to age, physical or mental incapacity, or other extraordinary 
circumstances.
                  3.F.4.c.  Household goods (HHG)/shipping allowance: upon a 
dependent departing for a safe-haven, unaccompanied baggage (for the 
dependent) and HHG items as needed for dependent comfort and well-being, may 
be transported at government expense.
                  3.F.4.d.  Privately Owned Vehicle (POV): Transportation of 
a POV at government expense to a safe-haven is not authorized.
                  3.F.4.e.  Pets:  A member is authorized transportation to 
the safe-haven location incident to an evacuation from a foreign PDS for up 
to two household pets (defined by JTR 060204 as a cat or dog), which the 
member owned at the evacuated foreign PDS (to include quarantine fees).
                  3.F.4.f.  Housing allowance:  A member, whose command-
sponsored dependents are evacuated and who was authorized with dependent 
housing allowance on the evacuation date, continues to be paid such allowance 
while the members PDS remains unchanged and the member continues to maintain 
private sector housing, as long as the command-sponsored dependents are 
receiving evacuation allowances.
                  3.F.4.g.  Family Separation Allowance (FSA):  A member is 
entitled to FSA if a member has a dependent depart an overseas duty station 
at government expense because of an evacuation and begins on the 31st day of 
dependent departure from the PDS.
          3.F.5.  The above listed allowances are not all inclusive and may 
not be applicable in all cases.  Members are encouraged to contact the MNCC 
to obtain information specific to their circumstances.  Receipts/records 
pertaining to evacuation should be retained.
          3.F.6.  Reporting requirements for ADs and ODs are contained in 
reference (ao).
    3.G.  Actions if in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 infection.
           3.G.1.  Service Members who have had close contact with someone 
with a confirmed COVID-19 infection and feel sick with a fever, cough or 
difficulty breathing shall:
                  3.G.1.a.  Inform their Senior Medical Department
Representative immediately.
                  3.G.1.b.  Seek medical care immediately.  Before going to 
the office of a doctor or emergency room, call ahead to provide recent travel 
locations and symptoms.
                  3.G.1.c.  Self-isolate for 14 days and notify chain of 
command immediately.
                  3.G.1.d.  Stay home except to get medical care.
                  3.G.1.e.  Cover mouth and nose with tissue or sleeve (not 
hands) when coughing or sneezing.
    3.H.  Holding Conferences.  All conferences shall be held virtually until 
further notice.
    3.I.  General Health Guidance.  Compliance with CDC guidance is critical 
to minimize the spread of COVID-19.  Per reference (ap), DoD is employing a 
strategy of using non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to limit 
transmission of COVID-19.  These NPIs are listed below.  In addition, 
reference (aq) provides additional guidance for protecting personnel in 
workplaces.  All personnel shall:
          3.I.1.  Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 
seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after 
blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.  If soap and water are not readily 
available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent 
alcohol.  Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
          3.I.2.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
          3.I.3.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
          3.I.4.  Stay home when you are sick.
          3.I.5.  Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the 
tissue in the trash.
          3.I.6.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces 
using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
          3.I.7.  Maximize open doors within area with equivalent 
classification levels.
          3.I.8.  Minimize meetings of more than five persons.

3.I.9.  Practice social/physical distancing by maintaining 6 feet of 
separation from another person.  This allows avoidance of close contact which 
is defined by the CDC being less than six feet from another person for more 
than 10 minutes.
          3.I.10.  Minimize attendance at gatherings and do not attend 
gatherings outside of the workplace with more than ten people.

3.I.11.  Follow guidance in reference (aa) concerning the wearing of face 
coverings.
    3.J.  Supplemental Guidance for Commanders.
          3.J.1.  IAW reference (q), commanders should identify and track all 
Service Members who travel or have a history of travel in the prior 14 days 
outside of the local area.  This includes travel by military or commercial 
means as well as private conveyance and includes all forms of travel to 
include PCS, TDY and leave. Commanders shall ensure Service Members implement 
the following actions for the next 14 days:
                  3.J.1.a.  Implement self-observation, i.e., take 
temperature twice a day and remain alert for fever, cough or difficulty 
breathing.
                  3.J.1.b.  Implement social distancing, i.e., remain out of 
congregated settings, avoid mass gatherings and maintain 6 feet or 2 meter 
distance from others when possible.
                  3.J.1.c.  If individuals feel feverish or develop measured 
fever, cough or difficulty breathing, immediately self-isolate, limit contact 
with others and seek advice by telephone from the appropriate healthcare 
provider to determine whether medical evaluation is required.
          3.J.2.  Commanders will adhere to DoD guidance for personnel 
traveling during the novel coronavirus outbreak per reference (q) to include 
COVID-19 screening at overseas military transportation terminals per 
reference (n).  Commanders will review the supplemental risk-based measures 
and observe the operational risk level mitigation actions for COVID-19 
outlined in reference (f).  Note that temperature checks are part of the 
required COVID-19 screening.
          3.J.3.  For individuals traveling OCONUS to OCONUS, commanders will 
ensure travel is mission essential and follow the guidance listing in 
reference (b) if compelling waivers are necessary.  Military air crew are 
exempt from the requirements in this NAVADMIN, but will ensure they actively 
practice social distancing and prudent measures to mitigate potential contact 
and COVID-19 transmission.
          3.J.4.  Commanders will comply with status of forces agreements 
(SOFA) when applicable.
          3.J.5.  Consider measures to place mission essential shore staffs 
on alternating day or split shift rotations.
          3.J.6.  Use maximum latitude to authorize telework, liberal leave, 
permissive TDY as necessary to minimize spread within your teams.
          3.J.7.  Implement social distancing techniques for any meetings you 
conduct.
          3.J.8.  Ensure the health of your force by conducting regular 
screenings and restrict movement of those potentially infected with COVID-19.
    3.K.  Entitlements.  Changes to entitlements associated with a ROM have 
been approved and put in place by DoD.  The entitlements include, but are not 
limited to per diem for Service Members directed to ROM after arrival at a 
duty station after a PCS move and the implementation of Hardship Duty Pay 
(HDPROM). In line with reference (au), if no-cost lodging is not available, 
Service Members directed to ROM (quarantine or isolation due to exposure or 
suspected exposure to COVID-19) may be eligible for HDP-ROM if they incur 
unreimbursed lodging costs.  Members ordered to pre-movement ROM (sequester) 
are not eligible for HDP-ROM and if executing a pre-movement ROM (sequester) 
for an entire unit or portion of a unit, and no-cost lodging is not 
available, units should consider use of O&M funding to contract for lodging.  
Units should contact the type commander for funding.  
This may be accomplished via a General Terms and Conditions (GT&C) document 
to avoid issues arising from Service Members without government travel cards.  
Also, members who are currently receiving Basic Allowance for Subsistence 
(BAS) and are directed to ROM or are directed to remain on base may be 
eligible to receive government provided meals and retain their BAS.  
Reference (ab) has details on specific requirements and the process to 
request approval for this.  Eligibility for entitlements varies based on 
individual circumstances.  If you have questions about entitlements, please 
contact the MNCC by phone at 1-833-330-6622 or via e-mail at 
askmncc(at)navy.mil.
    3.L.  Pregnancy.  The CDC acknowledges that pregnant women experience 
immunologic and physiologic changes which might make them more susceptible to 
viral respiratory infections like COVID-19.  At the direction of the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB), Navy issued direction to maximize telework, 
particularly for those who are high risk individuals, such as those who are 
pregnant.  COs and OICs have been given wide latitude to ensure members who 
need to be home to avoid this virus, stay home.
    3.M.  Leave.  Per reference (ar), DoD recognized that actions taken to 
stem the spread of COVID-19, to include restricting travel, have 
significantly limited the ability of Service Members to take leave during the 
national emergency.  Therefore, Service Members performing active service 
during the effective period of 11 Mar 2020 through 30 Sep 2020 are authorized 
to accumulate annual leave in excess of 60 days (not to exceed 120 days) as 
shown on the end of month September 2020 Leave and Earnings Statement.  Such 
members are further authorized to retain such unused leave until 30 Sep 2023.
Reference (ar) contains further details.  In addition, existing policy covers 
use of emergency leave during the COVID-19 response.
COs and OICs should consider risk to force and mission when deciding whether 
to grant emergency leave.  For Navy civilians, Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM) civilian workforce policies already make allowances for restoration of 
annual leave under exigent circumstances.  Contact your supervisory chain of 
command for further guidance.
    3.N.  Common Access Cards (CAC)/ID Cards.  NPC continues to coordinate 
temporary policy changes with OSD and the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) 
to allow for maximum flexibility in the use of existing CACs and ID cards to 
obtain or get access to services.  Navy ID card offices are open, but have 
transitioned to appointment only services, providing services for CAC/ID 
cards that are due to expire in the next 30 days.  Reference (ac) refers.
Additionally, reference (av) contains details on extension of system access 
certifications and modification to installation entry control point scanners 
to recognize when a person has an expired card, but still has an active 
affiliation with Navy.
    3.O.  Navy Medicine.  Navy Medicine personnel are deploying in support of 
COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts.  Military Treatment Centers (MTFs) remain 
open, but have reduced medical and dental services to only emergent and 
operational requirements in order to consolidate resources for COVID-19 care.  
Military pharmacies have also made changes to their operations to maximize 
social distancing. As MTFs respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, additional 
health protection measures are being implemented to minimize foot traffic in 
the medical facilities, help mitigate the spread of the virus and enable 
military medical professionals to better preserve the health and well-being 
of patients and staff.  Contact your local provider, MTF, or visit the MTF 
webpage for the latest information.
    3.P.  Casualty and Mortuary Affairs.  The mission of casualty and 
mortuary affairs is a sacred duty.  Reference (ad) was issued in advance of 
DoD and DoN policy still in development to provide interim casualty and 
mortuary affairs program changes necessary to mitigate risk to force due to 
the COVID-19 national emergency. These temporary changes are necessary to 
provide standardization across the Navy in order to preserve force readiness, 
limit the continuing spread of the virus, and most importantly, protect and 
preserve the health and welfare of our Sailors and civilians and the families 
and friends of our injured or fallen Shipmates.  One amendment to reference 
(ad) paragraph 7., Funeral Honors, is provided here. 
Until DoD or DoN publishes guidance authorizing a waiver to the statute that 
requires the provision of military funeral honors (MFHs), it is requested 
that region commanders, installation leaders, and servicing commands work 
with families and local funeral directors asking they suspend requests for 
MFHs until the end of the COVID-19 national emergency.  
If families insist on having MFHs present, installation leaders may provide 
the two-person detail for veterans, retirees and active duty members, given 
the current national emergency and in line with the law.  An update to 
reference (ad) with the fully informed guidance is expected in the coming 
weeks and will supersede all previous interim guidance to include that 
contained in this section.
    3.Q.  Midshipmen Summer Training.  Midshipmen training for Naval Reserve 
Officers Training Corps (NROTC) and U.S. Naval Academy (USNA) midshipmen 
normally occurs annually each summer.  Training Phase Zero had previously
been cancelled based upon the earlier stop movement.  After coordination 
between OPNAV N1, OPNAV N7, USNA, TYCOMs, and Fleets - and based on stop 
movement restrictions, lodging and medical support availability, and 
contracting lead times - USN Advanced Training Phases One through Three for 
NROTC and USNA midshipmen (i.e., Fleet cruises, CORTRAMID/PROTRAMID) is 
cancelled.
At this point, SEAL Officer Assessment and Selection (SOAS) training for 
USNA, ROTC and OCS SEAL prospective candidates will continue as planned but 
with appropriate risk mitigation measures in place.
    3.R.  Selection Boards.  Reference (ag) provided initial guidance on 
postponement of selection boards.  The MyNavy HR Team is actively working the 
plan to resume selection boards in light of positive trends related to COVID-
19.  A tentative plan is expected to be released by mid-May 2020 and will 
include the execution of all promotion, advancement and administrative 
selection boards by the end of calendar year 2020.  Navy remains committed to 
a fair and impartial selection board process for all eligible Sailors and is 
also committed to the health and wellness of Sailors who serve as members on 
these selection boards.  Once the board schedule is finalized, details will 
be promulgated to the Fleet.
     3.S.  Other COVID-19 Important Policy Updates.  Given the new stop 
movement extension, Sailors should expect an update shortly to Navy Wide 
Advancement Exams (NWAE) guidance.  As we work to balance risk to mission and 
risk to force across many policy decisions, our focus will also remain on the 
goal to disadvantage no Sailor.
Other important policy updates are listed for reference below.
          3.S.1.  NWAE.  Reference (ae).
          3.S.2.  Physical Readiness Policy.  Reference (af).
          3.S.3.  Hair Grooming Standards.  Reference (ah).
          3.S.4.  Transition Assistance Program (TAP).  Reference (ai).
          3.S.5.  ROM Guidance.  Reference (au) superseded reference (aj).
          3.S.6.  Voluntary Extensions for Active Component Navy
Members with Approved Separation or Retirement Dates.  Reference (ak) 
applies.  As the list of skills eligible for Sea Duty Incentive Pay (SDIP) 
was recently expanded, enlisted Sailors are encouraged to check the latest 
SDIP eligibility chart at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/pay-and-benefits to 
see if they are eligible for SDIP.
          3.S.7.  Expanded Opportunity for Retention on Active Duty in a 
Retired Status for Active Duty Officers with Pending Statutory Requirements.  
Reference (al).
          3.S.8.  Special Duty Medical Examinations Update. Reference (am).
          3.S.9.  Urinalysis Policy Update.  Reference (an).
          3.S.10.  COVID-19 Update Guidance to Support Fleet Operations.  
Reference (as).
          3.S.11.  Navy Reserve Force Policy Update.  Reference (at).

4.  Regular Reporting.  Reporting requirements for COVID-19 shifted from this 
NAVADMIN to a separate NAVADMIN on Reporting Requirements. Refer to reference 
(aw).  Reporting requirements for ADs and ODs is contained in reference (ao).

5.  Points of Contact.
    5.A.  Sailor Support.  Service Members with questions regarding this stop 
movement or entitlements for PCS travel should contact the MyNavy Career 
Center (1-833-330-6622) or email ASKMNCC(AT)NAVY.MIL. Detailers are ready to 
support all order modifications and commands should work with their placement 
officers.
    5.B.  Medical Questions.  BUMED Watch:  703-681-1087/1125 or NIPR EMAIL:  
usn.ncr.bumedfchva.list.bumed---2019-ncov-response-cell(AT)mail.mil.
    5.C.  Reporting Requirements.  OPNAV NOC BWC at 703-692-9284 or
BWC.PTGN(AT)NAVY.MIL and the OPNAV COVID response cell at 703-571-
2822 or OPNAV(UNDERSCORE)COVID(UNDERSCORE)CRISIS(UNDERSCORE)RESPONSE(UNDERSC
ORE)CELL(AT)NAVY.(SMIL.)MIL.
    5.D.  Navy civilians.  Navy civilians with questions regarding this 
guidance should contact their supervisory chain of command.

6.  The Navy will ensure the best possible Navy-wide force health protection 
for its Sailors, Navy civilians and family members.
However, all members of the Navy family must do their part by adhering to CDC 
guidelines as they relate to basic hygiene and human interaction.  The Navy 
will remain focused on meeting our global commitments while also ensuring the 
health and well-being of our Service Members, Navy civilians and our 
families.

7.  Our understanding of COVID-19 is rapidly evolving and this guidance will 
continue to be evaluated as conditions change.  We recognize many of the 
policies in this NAVADMIN will place a strain on our force, but they are 
absolutely necessary to preserve our ability to conduct the mission.  Local 
commanders will exercise prudent judgement when determining mission essential 
travel and granting waivers and err on the side of conservatism.  This is not 
business as usual.  The expectation is that these waivers are done on a case-
by-case basis and that they are very limited in number.
The entire team must understand their role in minimizing the spread of COVID-
19 among our ranks.  All efforts should be taken to combat the spread of 
COVID-19 and to minimize impact on our force.

8.  As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, commander feedback is an 
important part of issuing revised or additional guidance.  It is virtually 
impossible to address all specific cases or situations.  However, commanders 
have the latitude to adjust direction based upon their unique situation.  
Thank you for your leadership at the tip of the spear, wherever that may be.  
We know that it is not easy and simply ask that you make the best call 
possible  we will back you up.
