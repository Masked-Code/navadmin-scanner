SUBJ/NAVY FAMILY OMBUDSMAN APPRECIATION DAY// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  ON BEHALF OF NAVY LEADERSHIP, SAILORS, AND FAMILY 
MEMBERS ALL OVER THE WORLD, I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK 
THE THOUSANDS OF DEDICATED NAVY FAMILY OMBUDSMEN WHO WORK TIRELESSLY 
EVERYDAY TO IMPROVE FAMILY READINESS.  WE COULD NOT DO IT WITHOUT YOU, 
AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SERVICE.
2.  AS TALENTED VOLUNTEERS, OMBUDSMEN FORM THE VITAL LINK BETWEEN 
COMMANDS AND FAMILIES, HELPING TO EASE THE STRAIN OF LIFE IN THE NAVY 
SO OUR SAILORS CAN FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANT WORK THEY MUST DO FOR THE 
NATION.  OMBUDSMEN KEEP THE CHAIN OF COMMAND INFORMED ABOUT A WIDE 
VARIETY OF ISSUES FACING OUR PEOPLE, FROM PAY AND COMPENSATION TO CHILD 
CARE AND HOUSING, WHILE ALSO PLAYING A MAJOR ROLE IN CRISIS RESPONSE 
AND DISASTER PREPAREDNESS.
3.  AS THE PACE OF CHANGE AND THE NEED FOR TIMELY INFORMATION 
ACCELERATES, WE FIND OURSELVES INCREASINGLY RELYING ON OMBUDSMEN FOR 
GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT IN EVERYTHING FROM SURGE AND INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE 
DEPLOYMENTS TO NATURAL DISASTERS.  THEY HAVE RISEN TO THAT CHALLENGE 
MAGNIFICENTLY. 
4.  SEPTEMBER 14TH IS SET ASIDE TO RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE 
DEDICATED VOLUNTEERS.  I ENCOURAGE ALL COMMANDS TO HOST APPROPRIATE 
FUNCTIONS THAT EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION.  OMBUDSMEN 
APPRECIATION CERTIFICATES ARE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD FROM COMMANDER 
NAVY INSTALLATIONS COMMANDS FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM WEB SITE 
AT WWW.FFSP.NAVY.MIL.
5.  AGAIN, TO ALL OF THE OMBUDSMEN SERVING OUR NAVY AND THEIR FAMILIES 
AROUND THE FLEET, THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED SERVICE TO THE NAVY AND 
THE NATION.  ALL THE BEST TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES ON THIS OMBUDSMAN 
APPRECIATION DAY.
