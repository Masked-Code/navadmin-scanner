RMKS/1.  While progress has been made, National Background Investigation 
Bureau (NBIB) reports that a backlog of background investigations continues 
to challenge the Services, including Navy.  Several factors have been 
identified in the background investigation process which contributes to the 
backlog, to include submission of hardcopy fingerprints for investigations 
conducted by NBIB.  Failure to provide NBIB with fingerprints electronically 
results in a significant delay in processing of the background investigation.

2.  Per reference (a), electronic fingerprints are required to be submitted 
through Secure Web Fingerprint Transmission Plus (SWFT PLUS).

3.  Effective immediately, all Navy commands are hereby instructed to comply 
with the following:
    a.  Discontinue all hardcopy fingerprint submissions to the NBIB.
    b.  Electronic fingerprints are to be submitted through SWFT PLUS to 
support Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) fingerprint searches.  
Submission of electronic fingerprints through SWFT PLUS improves efficiency, 
timeliness of results, and quality of the print.  When electronic capture is 
not possible, contact usnavybib.fc(at)navy.mil.

4.  Reference (a) directs Navy Echelon I and II command security personnel to 
register as SWFT PLUS site administrators, and to then register and manage 
user accounts for subordinate commands.
    a.  Commands without SWFT PLUS capability should consult with their 
Security Office chain-of-command to obtain guidance from their cognizant 
Echelon I or II command.
    b.  Echelon I and II commands are to contact the Deputy Under Secretary 
of the Navy (DUSN) Security Directorate at donsecurity_pers.fct(at)navy.mil 
for additional information.

5.  To assist commands who do not currently have SWFT PLUS access, OPNAV 
N2N6/NIA SI3 (BIB Branch) developed a consolidated list of electronic 
fingerprint locations by region capable of capturing and submitting 
fingerprints via SWFT PLUS.  Contact OPNAV N2N6/NIA SI3 (BIB Branch) via 
email at usnavybib.fct(at)navy.mil for a copy of the SWFT PLUS location list.
    a.  When electronic capture and submission via SWFT PLUS is not possible, 
email OPNAV N2N6/NIA SI3 (BIB Branch) with specific details of issues 
preventing use of SWFT PLUS.  Include the command Security Office chain-of-
command points of contact information in the email.
    b.  Once commands establish SWFT PLUS connectivity, email OPNAV N2N6/NIA 
SI3 (BIB Branch) with the command name, address, POC name, and phone number.  
Additionally, report to OPNAV N2N6/NIA SI3 (BIB
Branch) any concerns with your command immediate transition to electronic 
fingerprint submissions.

6.  Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) Personnel Security/Assurance
(PSA) https://psa.dmdc.osd.mil/psawebdocs/docPage.jsp?p=SWFT
provides information on SWFT PLUS access, and a list of the supported 
devices.  When using the information on this site, commands are advised:
    a.  Commands must coordinate SWFT PLUS access through their Echelon I or 
II command, vice directly with DMDC.
    b.  DON specific SWFT PLUS guidance is available on the DUSN Security 
Directorate Portal at https://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs
/DUSNP/Security-Directorate/Personnel-Security/SitePages/Home.aspx
    c.  When purchasing a fingerprint scanner, the scanner must be on both 
the DMDC SWFT PLUS Supported Device List and the FBI certified product list.  
The fingerprint scanner must also be authorized for use on the Department of 
Defense or DON network, (i.e., Navy and Marine Corps Intranet, ONE-NET, 
etc.), where the device will be connected.

7.  NBIB continues to accept hard copy print submissions from Navy, but they 
are sending a monthly report of all hard copy prints submitted from Navy to 
OPNAV N2N6/NIA SI3 (BIB Branch) to assist with transitioning to electronic 
fingerprint submissions.

8.  Direct any questions to the point of contact, Ms. Jennifer Floyd,
(703) 604-5564 or jennifer.floyd3(at)navy.mil.

9.  Released by VADM Matthew J. Kohler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
