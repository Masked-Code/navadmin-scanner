NARR//REF A IS OPNAVINST 1300.14D, SUITABILITY SCREENING FOR OVERSEAS  
AND REMOTE DUTY ASSIGNMENT.  REFS B THROUGH D ARE THE MILPERSMAN 
ARTICLES FOR  SUITABILITY AND SELECTION FOR OVERSEAS SERVICE, 
SUITABILITY FOR OVERSEAS ASSIGNMENT  SCREENING AND REPORTING, AND 
OVERSEAS SCREENING DEFICIENCY REPORTS AND EARLY RETURN  REQUEST.  REF E 
IS THE REPORT OF SUITABILITY FOR OVERSEAS ASSIGNMENT FORM.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES INFORMATION FOR ALL COMMANDERS AND  
COMMANDING OFFICERS ON THE NAVY OVERSEAS SCREENING PROGRAM.  OVERSEAS 
SCREENING  IS A KEY COMPONENT TO GUARANTEE THAT PROPER SUPPORT IS 
AVAILABLE TO OUR  OVERSEAS AND FORWARD
DEPLOYED FAMILIES.   AN INEFFECTIVE OVERSEAS SCREENING PROGRAM
 OPERATIONALLY IMPACTS
THE GAINING COMMAND, TAKES A TOLL ON OUR SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES,  
AND WASTES PRECIOUS PCS DOLLARS.  WE OWE IT TO OUR FORCES OVERSEAS AND 
TO OUR  SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO GET THIS IMPORTANT PROCESS RIGHT.  
REFERENCE A IS THE  NAVY'S OVERARCHING POLICY FOR OVERSEAS SCREENING.  
REFS B THROUGH D WERE UPDATED AND  RELEASED IN LATE 2009.  ALL COMMANDS 
SHOULD REVIEW THESE ARTICLES IN THEIR ENTIRETY.

2.  WHILE THE OVERALL NUMBER OF OVERSEAS SCREENING DISCREPANCIES IS  
RELATIVELY LOW  COMPARED TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OVERSEAS ORDERS WRITTEN, 
THERE IS  ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT.  IN FISCAL YEAR 2009, THE TOTAL COST TO 
NAVY FOR EARLY  RETURNS DUE TO OVERSEAS SCREENING DEFICIENCIES WAS 
NEARLY 1 MILLION DOLLARS.  BEYOND  THE MONETARY IMPACT, IMPROPER 
OVERSEAS SCREENINGS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR  SAILORS AND THEIR 
FAMILY MEMBERS WHEN THEY ARE REASSIGNED ON SHORT NOTICE.

3.  WE HAVE REVIEWED RECENT OVERSEAS SCREENING DEFICIENCY REPORTS AND  
HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME RECURRING DISCREPANCIES LISTED BELOW.  WHILE OTHER  
UNITS HAVE A ROLE IN PROVIDING INFORMATION IN THE SCREENING PROCESS, 
THE  TRANSFERRING COMMANDING OFFICER (CO) IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR 
AUTHORIZING AND APPROVING  THE MEMBER TO TRANSFER.
    A.  SUITABILITY.  TRANSFERRING COMMANDS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR  
INVESTIGATING A MEMBER'S SUITABILITY FOR OVERSEAS ASSIGNMENT IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH  REFERENCES A AND B.
TWO COMMON ISSUES ARE A LACK OF VERIFICATION OF SUFFICIENT OBLISERVE  
AND IDENTIFICATION OF OUTSTANDING LEGAL CONCERNS AND/OR INDEBTEDNESS.
    B.  MEDICAL WAIVERS.  THE DETACHING MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITY
 (MTF) IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR REQUESTING A WAIVER FOR ONGOING MEDICAL CONDITIONS  
THAT REQUIRE FURTHER TREATMENT OR MEDICATION AFTER TRANSFER.  
RECOGNIZING THAT, IN  SOME CASES, THE SERVICE MEMBER MAY NOT FULLY 
DISCLOSE ALL INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY  MEMBER MEDICAL ISSUES, MEDICAL 
SCREENERS SHOULD CONSULT ALL AVAILABLE ELECTRONIC AND  PAPER MEDICAL 
RECORDS AND QUESTION THE SERVICE MEMBER ON ANY DISCREPANCIES BEFORE  
INDICATING ON THE SCREENING FORM THAT THE SERVICE MEMBER OR FAMILY 
MEMBER IS  SUITABLE.
    C.  EDUCATION PLANS.  DETACHING MTF MUST FORWARD ANY  
INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PLANS TO THE GAINING MTF PRIOR TO TRANSFER.
    D.  TREATMENT AVAILABLE AT GAINING MTF.  WE HAVE SEEN CASES WHERE  
THE GAINING MTF INDICATES ABILITY TO PROVIDE CARE FOR SERVICE/FAMILY 
MEMBER  WITHOUT PROPERLY SCREENING THE CURRENT MEDICAL CONDITIONS OR 
MEDICATION REQUIREMENTS.
 THIS HAS
RESULTED IN THE EARLY RETURN OF THE SERVICE/FAMILY MEMBER DUE TO THE  
GAINING MTF'S INABILITY TO SUPPORT.
    E.  GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS.  THE PERSONNEL SUPPORT  
DETACHMENT (PSD) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE SCREENING FORM IS 
PROPERLY SIGNED BY  BOTH THE COMMANDING OFFICER AND MEDICAL 
REPRESENTATIVE BEFORE RELEASING  TRANSFER/TRAVEL DOCUMENTS, IAW 
NAVADMIN 085/07.  THE PSD SHOULD PERSONALLY REVIEW REF  E TO ENSURE 
OVERSEAS SUITABILITY AND NOT RELY ON A PRINTOUT FROM BUPERS ONLINE.

4.  COMMANDS THAT GAIN/RECEIVE A MEMBER OR DEPENDENT FAMILY MEMBER  WHO 
DOES NOT MEET SCREENING CRITERIA SHOULD ABIDE BY REF D, WHICH PROVIDES  
GUIDANCE ON THE REPORTING PROCEDURES AND THE TYPES OF REPORTS USED IN 
THE OVERSEAS  SCREENING PROGRAM.

5.  APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OF OUR OVERSEAS COMMANDS, SAILORS AND  NAVY 
FAMILIES QQQQ BY WORKING TO IMPROVE OUR OVERSEAS SCREENING PROCESS.

6.  POINT OF CONTACT:  CDR CARL CHAFFIN, AT (901) 874-2117/DSN 882 OR  
EMAIL AT PERS451(AT)NAVY.MIL.
