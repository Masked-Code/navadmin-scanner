RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN CODIFIES THE GUIDELINES FOR THE NEW PHYSICAL 
TRAINING UNIFORM (PTU) MANNER OF WEAR.  REF A ANNOUNCED THE APPROVAL OF 
A NAVY PTU FOR ALL SAILORS, E-1 THROUGH O-10.  AFTER SIGNIFICANT 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND FEEDBACK FROM THE FLEET, THE NAVY PTU 
ROLL OUT COMMENCED IN APRIL, BEGINNING WITH SENIOR OFFICER AND ENLISTED 
LEADERSHIP, FOLLOWED BY RECRUIT DIVISION COMMANDERS AND RECRUITS AT RTC 
GREAT LAKES. CURRENTLY THE PTU IS BEING DISTRIBUTED TO NAVY EXCHANGES 
FOR PURCHASE AT DESIGNATED LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE FLEET.
2.  THE NEW PTU APPROPRIATELY REFLECTS OUR NAVY COLORS; IS TAILORED FOR 
A PROGRESSIVE FIT AND APPEARANCE; AND IS MADE OF MODERN, MOISTURE 
WICKING AND ODOR-RESISTANT FABRIC.  INITIAL FEEDBACK ON THE PTU HAS 
BEEN POSITIVE WITH REGARD TO LOOK, FIT AND PERFORMANCE.  WE WILL BE 
MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO FUTURE PRODUCTION LOTS, TO INCLUDE FLEET FEEDBACK, 
SO WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE YOUR UNIFORMS AND PROVIDE THE APPEARANCE, 
FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY YOU NEED AND DESIRE.
3.  MANNER OF WEAR - THE PTU IS DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR GROUP/UNIT 
PHYSICAL TRAINING ACTIVITIES AND THE SEMI-ANNUAL PHYSICAL FITNESS 
ASSESSMENT (PFA); HOWEVER, IT CAN BE WORN BOTH ON AND OFF BASE FOR 
FITNESS AND/OR LEISURE UNLESS DETERMINED OTHERWISE BY REGIONAL 
COORDINATORS OR COMMANDING OFFICERS.
A.  IN-PORT AND WHEN PERFORMING COMMAND DIRECTED "GROUP/UNIT" 
PHYSICAL TRAINING ACTIVITIES, SEMI-ANNUAL PFA (TO INCLUDE BODY 
COMPOSITION ASSESSMENT (BCA) AND PHYSICAL READINESS TEST (PRT)), THE 
PTU SHIRT WILL BE TUCKED INTO THE SHORTS.  SHORTS WILL BE WORN FULLY ON 
THE WAIST.  THE LENGTH OF THE SHORTS WILL NOT EXTEND BELOW THE TOP OF 
THE KNEE.  RUNNING SHOES WILL BE COMFORTABLE AND SUPPORT THE PLANNED 
EXERCISE.  ATHLETIC SOCKS MUST BE WORN AND SHALL NOT EXTEND ABOVE MID-
CALF.  LOW CUT SOCKS ARE PERMITTED.  PREGNANT SAILORS WILL WEAR THE 
SHIRT OUT AND WILL DISCONTINUE WEARING THE PTU WHEN IT BECOMES TOO 
TIGHT.  FEMALE SAILORS WILL WEAR A SPORT OR DRESS BRASSIERE WHEN 
WEARING THE PTU.  ADDITIONAL UNDERGARMENTS ARE AUTHORIZED FOR ALL HANDS.
B.  AT SEA, THE WEARING OF THE PTU WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE 
COMMANDING OFFICER.  REQUIREMENTS FOR FEMALE SAILORS REMAIN AS STATED 
WHETHER WEARING THE PTU OR OTHER PERSONAL FITNESS ATTIRE.
C.  DURING INDIVIDUAL PT, SHIRTS MAY BE WORN IN OR OUT OF SHORTS.  
ALL OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE THE SAME AS "IN-PORT."
D.  WHILE ON LIBERTY, COMPONENTS OF THE PTU ARE AUTHORIZED TO WEAR 
INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY.  THE PTU WILL NOT BE WORN WHILE IN A DUTY 
STATUS OR WHEN CONDUCTING OFFICIAL BUSINESS ON BASE (E.G., PSD'S,

AUTHORIZED BUT MUST NOT BE VISIBLE WHILE STANDING AND WILL BE EITHER 
BLACK OR NAVY BLUE IN COLOR.
G.  IN ALL CASES, THE PTU WILL BE WORN IN SUCH A MANNER SO AS TO 
REFLECT CREDIT UPON THE NAVY AND THE INDIVIDUAL WEARING THE PTU.

ON CURRENT PHYSICAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.  PTU COMPONENTS WEAR LIFE
