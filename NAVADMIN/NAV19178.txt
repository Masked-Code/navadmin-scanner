RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces a temporary exception to policy
(ETP) by the Department of Defense (DoD) to Post 9-11 GI Bill transfer of 
education benefits (TEB) eligibility announced in reference (a).  This change 
does not affect Service Members with an approved TEB request.

2.  Reference (b) extends the implementation date of paragraph 3a of 
reference (a) from 12 July 2019 to 12 January 2020.  The former ETP announced 
in reference (c) has expired.

3.  Specifically, Service Members who have served 16 or more years may 
transfer Post 9-11 GI Bill benefits to their eligible dependents until 12 
January 2020 with an additional 4-year service obligation on Active Duty or 
in the Selected Reserve (SELRES).  Failure to complete the service obligation 
will result in dependent ineligibility, or if benefits have been used, all 
monies will be subject to recoupment.  Separations that do not result in loss 
of TEB eligibility are described in reference (a), enclosure 3, paragraphs 
3g(2)(a) through 3g(2)(h).

4.  All officers and enlisted Service Members must complete the pre- 
requisite online self-service Statement of Understanding by selecting the
