SUBJ/CNO FAREWELL MESSAGE TO THE FLEET//

RMKS/1.  IT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST PRIVILEGE AND HIGHEST HONOR TO SERVE AS YOUR 
CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.  YOUR TALENT, DEDICATION, AND INITIATIVE AS UNITED 
STATES SAILORS DURING THIS TIME OF WAR AND CHANGE HAVE MADE OUR NAVY THE MOST 
CAPABLE AND READY NAVAL FORCE THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN.  I COULD NOT BE MORE 
PROUD OF WHAT YOU DO AND HOW EXCEPTIONALLY WELL YOU DO IT.

2.  OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS AT SEA, IN THE AIR, ON THE GROUND, AND IN 
CYBERSPACE YOU HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE.  MORE THAN 40 PERCENT OF OUR SHIPS AND 
MORE THAN 50,000 SAILORS ARE DEPLOYED TODAY, INCLUDING 12,000 SAILORS ON THE 
GROUND IN CENTRAL COMMAND AND MORE THAN 8,000 INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEES AROUND THE 
WORLD.  YOU KNOW THIS FIRSTHAND BECAUSE YOU EXPERIENCE THE STEADY PACE OF 
OPERATIONS OUR NAVY HAS SUSTAINED OVER THE LAST DECADE FROM THE FRONT LINES IN 
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN TO THE SEA LINES OF COMMUNICATION IN THE PACIFIC AND 
INDIAN OCEANS.  YOU ARE THE REAL CAPABILITY OF OUR NAVY.  YOU ARE IN EVERY 
OCEAN AND ON EVERY CONTINENT.  YOU TAKE THE FIGHT TO THOSE WHO WISH US HARM.  
YOU PREVAIL AGAINST PIRATES, TRAFFICKERS, AND TERRORISTS.  YOU DELIVER VITAL 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IN THE WAKE OF DISASTERS ON A MOMENT'S NOTICE WHEREVER 
NEEDED.  YOU PREVENT CONFLICT AND DEMONSTRATE U.S. COMMITMENT TO ALLIES AND 
PARTNERS THROUGH YOUR  PERSISTENT, CREDIBLE FORWARD PRESENCE AND VARIED 
MARITIME  OPERATIONS.
YOU EPITOMIZE FLEXIBILITY AND AGILITY AS OUR NAVY RESPONDS RAPIDLY AND 
INNOVATIVELY TO EMERGING CRISES AND UNEXPECTED DEMANDS.

3.  THESE ACHIEVEMENTS HAVE COME WITH A PRICE.  EVERY DAY, I AM INSPIRED BY 
THE TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES MAKE FOR OUR NAVY AND FOR OUR 
NATION.  THANK YOU FOR SERVING.  YOU ARE THE FINEST SAILORS WHO HAVE EVER 
SAILED.

4.  I AM RELIEVED TODAY BY ADMIRAL JONATHAN GREENERT.  HE IS AN  EXPERIENCED 
LEADER AND OPERATOR WHOSE SOUND JUDGMENT AND DEVOTION  TO OUR NAVY WILL KEEP 
US READY, CAPABLE, AND DOMINANT WELL INTO THE FUTURE.  OUR NAVY IS IN 
EXCELLENT HANDS.

5.  ELLEN AND I WISH EACH OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES FAIR WINDS AND  FOLLOWING 
SEAS.  I AM PROUD TO HAVE SERVED WITH YOU.

6.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, U.S. NAVY.//
