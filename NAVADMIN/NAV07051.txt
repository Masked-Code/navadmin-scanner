REF/A/DOC/CNO/20DEC2006/3000.13C//
AMPN/REF A IS THE PERSTEMPO INSTRUCTION// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE HAVE BEEN REVIEWING THE 
DEPLOYABILITY AND EMPLOYABILITY OF OUR NAVAL FORCES.  THE THRUST OF 
THIS EFFORT WAS TO EXAMINE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE MIGHT INCREASE OUR 
OPERATIONAL AVAILABILITY - THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME OUR FORCES ARE 
AVAILABLE FOR OPERATIONAL TASKS AND MISSIONS - WHILE STILL PRESERVING 
OUR OVERALL READINESS AND THE QUALITY OF SERVICE FOR OUR SAILORS AND 
THEIR FAMILIES.  AS A RESULT, WE HAVE REVISITED OUR DEPLOYMENT POLICIES, 
REVISED SOME DEFINITIONS AND DEPLOYMENT METRICS, AND SIGNED OUT A NEW 
PERSTEMPO INSTRUCTION.
2.  THE NATION'S MANY STRATEGIC CHALLENGES REQUIRE A NAVY THAT IS 
AVAILABLE, RESPONSIVE, AND READY.  WE ARE DELIBERATELY TAKING ACTION TO 
STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN OUR NEED TO PROVIDE ROTATIONAL FORWARD 
FORCES, OUR OBLIGATION TO PREPARE FORCES FOR MAJOR CONTINGENCIES AND 
CRISIS, AND OUR TIME AT HOME. WE WILL DO THAT BY:
A.  MAXIMIZING OUR ABILITY TO DEPLOY - WHEN NEEDED - IN THE WAR ON 
TERROR.
B.  PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY TO OUR COMBATANT COMMANDERS.
C.  ALIGNING OUR DEPLOYMENT TERMINOLOGY AND OUR DEPLOYMENT POLICY WITH 
OUR MARINE CORPS, ARMY, AND AIR FORCE COUNTERPARTS TO THE EXTENT 
POSSIBLE.
D.  ACCOUNTING FOR ALL OF OUR DEPLOYED TIME.
3.  WE HAVE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED THE POTENTIAL FOR PERSONNEL IMPACTS 
DURING THIS REVIEW.  AS SUCH, WE WILL MANAGE THE DEPLOYMENT THROTTLE ON 
OUR FORCES SO OUR SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO A 
ROUTINELY EXCESSIVE TEMPO OF OPERATIONS.  PER REF A, THE FOLLOWING IS 
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY:
A.  THE TRADITIONAL 50 PERCENT TIME-IN-HOMEPORT STANDARD IS REAFFIRMED.  
NOW CALLED HOMEPORT TEMPO (VICE PERSTEMPO), THIS METRIC IS THE 
PERCENTAGE OF TIME A UNIT IS IN HOMEPORT WITHIN THE EMPLOYMENT CYCLE.  
THIS CYCLE IS USUALLY A PERIOD OF ABOUT 27-32 MONTHS, BUT MAY VARY FROM 
UNIT TO UNIT AND PLATFORM TO PLATFORM.
B.  THE 56-DAY MINIMUM FOR DEPLOYMENT LENGTH IS ELIMINATED.  ANY TIME 
SPENT ON DEPLOYMENT WILL BE COUNTED AS DEPLOYED TIME, EVEN IF ONLY FOR 
ONE DAY.  AT THE SAME TIME, IF A UNIT IS EXPECTED TO DEPLOY MORE THAN 
ONCE BETWEEN MAINTENANCE PHASES, THE MAXIMUM PLANNED DEPLOYMENT LENGTH 
WILL BE 6 MONTHS.  IF ONLY ONE DEPLOYMENT IS PLANNED BETWEEN 
MAINTENANCE PERIODS, THEN THE MAXIMUM PLANNED DEPLOYMENT LENGTH WILL BE 
7 MONTHS. WE WILL ENDEAVOR TO SCHEDULE 6 MONTH MAXIMUM DEPLOYMENT 
LENGTHS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE.
C. THE TERM TURN-AROUND-RATIO (TAR) HAS BEEN CHANGED TO THE JOINT USE 
TERM DWELL, WHICH IS THE RATIO OF THE NUMBER OF DAYS A UNIT SPENDS 
BETWEEN DEPLOYMENTS AND THE LENGTH OF THE LAST DEPLOYMENT IN AN 
OPERATIONAL CYCLE.  WE WILL MAINTAIN DWELL RATIOS AT GREATER THAN OR 
EQUAL TO 1.0 BETWEEN OUR MAINTENANCE PERIODS.  WHILE THIS IS A CHANGE 
FROM THE SIMILARLY COMPUTED 2.0 TAR OF BEFORE, SOME IN THE FLEET HAVE 
BEEN OPERATING UNDER THIS POLICY IN A DE FACTO SENSE THROUGHOUT THE 
GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM.  ADDITIONALLY, THIS CHANGE ALIGNS NAVY LIMITS 
WITH THOSE OF THE OTHER SERVICES.
4.  THESE CHANGES WILL IMPROVE OUR AVAILABILITY IN THE LONG WAR AND FOR 
MAJOR CONTINGENCIES.  AT THE SAME TIME, IT WILL PRESERVE OUR 
TRADITIONAL 50 PERCENT TIME-IN-HOMEPORT STANDARD, BETTER ACCOUNT FOR 
OUR DEPLOYED TIME, AND PROVIDE THE MOST PREDICTABILITY WE CAN IN OUR 
DEPLOYMENT AND OPERATING SCHEDULES.
5.  WE MUST ALWAYS BE PREPARED TO RESPOND AS THE STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT 
DEMANDS, AS WE HAVE DONE RECENTLY TO SUPPORT SENDING A SECOND CARRIER 
STRIKE GROUP TO USCENTCOM.  THIS APPROACH WILL DO MUCH FOR OUR ABILITY 
TO DEFEND THE NATION, DETER AND DISSUADE OUR ADVERSARIES, REASSURE OUR 
PARTNERS AND FRIENDS, AND WHEN CALLED, TO FIGHT AND WIN THE NATION'S 
WARS.  IT IS WHY THE NATION HAS A NAVY.
YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS CRITICAL TO THIS EFFORT AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
PROFESSIONALISM, LEADERSHIP, AND MISSION FOCUS.
