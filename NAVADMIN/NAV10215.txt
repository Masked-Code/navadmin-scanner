SUBJ/PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND ADVANCEMENT GUIDANCE FOR INDIVIDUAL 
AUGMENTEE SAILORS//

RMKS/1.  OUR SAILORS CONTINUE TO ANSWER THE CALL AND SERVE OUR COUNTRY 
AS INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEES (IA).  TO ENSURE THIS SERVICE IS PROPERLY 
RECOGNIZED, THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES SPECIFIC EXECUTION POLICY FOR 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS AND ADVANCEMENT ELIGIBILITY FOR IA SAILORS.  AS 
ANNOUNCED IN REF A, PERFORMANCE EVALUATION CHANGES ARE DESIGNED SO THAT 
IA SAILORS ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR SERVICE AWAY FROM THEIR PARENT 
COMMAND AND REMAIN COMPETITIVE WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS WHO ARE PRESENT 
AT AND EVALUATED BY THEIR PARENT COMMAND.
CHANGES TO ADVANCEMENT ELIGIBILITY ENSURE OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE WHILE 
ON IA IS PROPERLY REWARDED.

2.  PER REF B, AN IA SAILOR IS DEFINED AS ANY SAILOR IN RECEIPT OF 
INDIVIDUAL DEPLOYMENT ORDERS FROM NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (PERS-4), TO 
INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE MANPOWER MANAGEMENT ASSIGNMENTS (IAMM), 
GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM SUPPORT ASSIGNMENTS (GSA), MOBILIZED RESERVE 
PERSONNEL (RC MOB) NOT MOBILIZED AS PART OF AN ESTABLISHED COMMISSIONED 
RESERVE COMPONENT UNIT, AND HEALTH SERVICES AUGMENTATION PROGRAM (HSAP) 
PERSONNEL.  REF C ESTABLISHED THE OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATION 
SUPPORT ASSIGNMENT (OSA) AS A NEW PROGRAM FOR ENLISTED IA VOLUNTARY 
ASSIGNMENTS.

3.  THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ACTIVE COMPONENT IA (INCLUDING FULL TIME 
SUPPORT) PERSONNEL.  PERFORMANCE EVALUATION POLICY FOR RESERVE 
COMPONENT PERSONNEL REMAINS UNCHANGED, PER CHAPTERS 9 AND 10 OF REF D.

4.  EFFECTIVE 1 AUGUST 2010:
    A.  REGULAR REPORTING SENIORS MUST MAINTAIN REGULAR PERFORMANCE 
EVALUATION CONTINUITY, AS OUTLINED IN REF D, AND WILL USE BILLET 
SUBCATEGORY (BLOCK 21) CODE "INDIV AUG" TO BREAK OUT PERSONNEL WHO ARE 
SERVING ON, OR HAVE COMPLETED AN IA ASSIGNMENT WITHIN THE FOLLOWING 
PARAMETERS:
        (1) FOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS WHERE THE REPORTING PERIOD END 
DATE OCCURS WHILE ON IA ASSIGNMENTS:
            (A) THE REPORTING SENIOR SHALL USE BILLET SUBCATEGORY CODE 
"INDIV AUG" (BLOCK 21) FOR SAILORS AT THEIR PARENT COMMAND FOR LESS 
THAN 240 DAYS OR FOR PERIODS OF PERFORMANCE LESS THAN 240 DAYS.
            (B) FOR SAILORS ATTACHED TO THEIR PARENT COMMAND FOR 
GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 240 DAYS OF THE REPORTING PERIOD, THE SAILOR 
SHALL BE EVALUATED WITH THEIR PEERS, IAW REF D.
        (2) FOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS WHERE THE DATE OF REPORT OCCURS 
AFTER COMPLETION OF IA ASSIGNMENT:
            (A) THE REGULAR REPORTING SENIOR SHALL USE BILLET 
SUBCATEGORY CODE "INDIV AUG" (BLOCK 21) FOR ANY REGULAR PERFORMANCE 
EVALUATION REQUIRED WITH A REPORTING PERIOD END DATE LESS THAN OR EQUAL 
TO 180 DAYS AFTER A MEMBER HAS RETURNED TO THEIR PARENT COMMAND FROM AN 
IA ASSIGNMENT.  THE 180 DAY PERIOD DOES NOT APPLY FOR SAILORS 
TRANSFERRED TO A NEW PARENT COMMAND.
            (B) FOR REQUIRED REPORTS WITH A REPORTING PERIOD END DATE 
GREATER THAN 180 DAYS AFTER RETURN FROM IA ASSIGNMENT, THE SAILOR SHALL 
BE EVALUATED WITH THEIR PEERS AS OUTLINED IN REF D.
    B.  PER REF D CHAPTER 4, IA SUPPORTED COMMANDS WILL COMPLETE 
CONCURRENT PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS AND ENTER "INDIV AUG" CODE IN BLOCK 
21.

5.  REVISED ADVANCEMENT ELIGIBILITY AND PERFORMANCE MARK AVERAGE 
COMPUTATION GUIDANCE FOR IA SAILORS WITH REPORTS AFTER 1 AUGUST 2010 
INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:
    A.  CONCURRENT PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS COMPLETED WHILE ON AN IA 
ASSIGNMENT WILL COUNT TOWARD PERFORMANCE MARK AVERAGE (PMA) 
CALCULATIONS AND FOR TIME IN RATE (TIR) WAIVERS PROVIDED A PROMOTABLE 
OR HIGHER PROMOTION RECOMMENDATION IS ASSIGNED BY EITHER THE REGULAR 
REPORTING SENIOR OR THE IA ASSIGNMENT REPORTING SENIOR.  NOTE:  ONLY 
CONCURRENT EVALUATIONS WITH "INDIV AUG"
IN BLOCK 21 COUNT TOWARDS A PMA OR TIR WAIVER.  WHEN REGULAR REPORTS 
AND CONCURRENT REPORTS WITH "INDIV AUG" IN BLOCK 21 OVERLAP, BOTH WILL 
COUNT TOWARDS PMA COMPUTATION.
    B.  COMPUTE PMA AS FOLLOWS:  USE ALL EVALUATIONS (NAVPERS 1616/26, 
EVALUATION REPORT AND COUNSELING RECORDS (E1-E6) (ACTIVE/INACTIVE)) IN 
THE RESPECTIVE PAYGRADE, INCLUDING FROCKED, FOR THE COMPUTATION PERIOD 
ANNOUNCED IN THE RESPECTIVE CYCLE NAVADMIN.
    C.  COMMANDING OFFICERS/OFFICERS IN CHARGE (CO'S/OIC'S) MAY WAIVE 
UP TO ONE YEAR OF THE REQUIRED TIR FOR SAILORS IN PAYGRADES E5 AND E6 
UNDER THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS:
        (1) MUST RECEIVE A PROMOTION RECOMMENDATION OF "EARLY PROMOTE"
ON MOST RECENT OBSERVED PERIODIC EVALUATION IN CURRENT PAYGRADE.
        (2) MUST RECEIVE A PROMOTION RECOMMENDATION OF "EARLY PROMOTE"
ON AN IA ASSIGNMENT CONCURRENT OR CONCURRENT/REGULAR REPORT FOR PERIOD 
(BLOCK 14 TO BLOCK 15) OF 180 DAYS OR GREATER.
        (3) SAILORS RECOMMENDED AS "EARLY PROMOTE" WHO LATER RECEIVE A 
SPECIAL, TRANSFER, OR DETACHMENT OF REPORTING SENIOR EVALUATION BEFORE 
THE NEXT ADVANCEMENT EXAMINATION WITH A PROMOTION RECOMMENDATION OTHER 
THAN EARLY PROMOTE ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR THIS WAIVER (NOT OBSERVED 
REPORTS ARE EXCLUDED).

6.  PER REF E, PARA 216, A TIR WAIVER IS GRANTED AT THE DISCRETION OF 
THE CO/OIC AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AUTOMATIC FOR EVERY SAILOR WHO 
COULD QUALIFY.  NOTE:  CANDIDATES PARTICIPATING IN THE EXAM WITH AN 
EARLY PROMOTE TIR WAIVER MUST BE IDENTIFIED IN ENCLOSURE (3) OF AN EXAM 
RETURN TRANSMITTAL PER REF E, FIGURE 6-1, OTHERWISE THE WAIVER WILL 
ERROR A RESULT OF INSUFFICIENT TIME IN RATE.

7.  THESE CHANGES RECOGNIZE OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE SINCE CONCURRENT 
EVALUATIONS RECEIVED WHILE ON AN IA ASSIGNMENT WILL COUNT TOWARD PMA 
CALCULATIONS AND TIR WAIVERS.  IN ADDITION, THE CHANGES HELP ENSURE IA 
SAILORS ARE NOT PLACED AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE WHILE ASSIGNED TO 
IA TOURS.
