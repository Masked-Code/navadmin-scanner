RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides transition assistance for the afloat 
community to assist the Navy in converting to Risk Management Framework (RMF) 
by 31 December 2020.  This RMF Afloat way ahead process is intended to 
provide an alternative solution for attaining RMF site authorizations for 
ships, which in turn will allow for a deliberate RMF transition of the 
systems hosted on those ships.

2.  Ships under U.S. Fleet Forces Command (USFF), Commander, U.S. Pacific 
Fleet (COMPACFLT) and Military Sealift Command (MSC) with Defense Information 
Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) Authorizations to 
Operate (ATO) that expire on or before 1 January 2020 are authorized to 
pursue an Afloat RMF Bridge Conversion (RBC).  The intent of the Afloat RBC 
is to utilize the assessed and certified risk of a DIACAP submission, and 
issue an RMF ATO instead of a DIACAP ATO.  The Afloat RBC ATO will be issued 
for no more than 12 months.  All ships under the scope of this NAVADMIN will 
be required to transition to full RMF on or before the Authorization 
Termination Date (ATD) of their respective RBC.  Amplifying guidance is as 
follows:
    a.  The Package Submitting Officer (PSO) will process the package for a 
DIACAP Certification Determination (CD) issuance from the Navy Security 
Control Assessor for impacted ships as per references (c) and (d).
    b.  The DIACAP CD shall be no older than 180 days.
    c.  Following the CD issuance, the PSO will process the package for an 
Afloat RBC following reference (d).
    d.  All DIACAP artifacts will be in compliance with reference (d).
    e.  The DIACAP artifacts that accompanied the DIACAP submission will be 
used to leverage Afloat RBCs.

3.  Programs outside of the afloat community are eligible for additional new 
alternate RMF transition processes, which are detailed in reference (e).

4.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.

5.  Released by VADM Matthew J. Kohler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
