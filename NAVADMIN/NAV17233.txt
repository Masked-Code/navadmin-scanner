SUBJ/SHUTDOWN OF NAVAL WAR COLLEGE CDROM-BASED PROGRAM//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the decision to discontinue delivery of 
Intermediate Joint Professional Military Education
(JPME-I) through the Naval War College (NWC), College of Distance Education 
(CDE) Compact Disk read only memory-based Program.  This decision is taken 
because of the expansion of internet availability and coverage that obviates 
delivery of Compact Disks, Digital Versatile Disc, and printed course 
materials through the postal system.  Given advances in distance learning 
technologies that provide for both synchronous and asynchronous interaction 
between students and faculty as well as between groups of students, it makes 
sense to eliminate individual, self-administered graduate level JPME-I 
courses, that do not provide the rigorous instructor-led education, in a 
joint classroom or online cohort that is necessary to prepare military 
leaders for todays challenging environment.  A phased shutdown of the program 
will proceed as follows:
    a.  New applications for the CDROM-based Program will not be accepted 
after 30 September 2017.
    b.  Students currently enrolled and active in any one of the three core 
courses in the program will have 20 months from their initial course 
enrollment date to complete all course and program requirements.  
Accordingly, the program will cease operations on 31 May 2019, 20 months 
after the last enrollments on 30 September 2017.
    c.  Active students who are enrolled in the program on 31 May 2019, but 
who have not completed their current course will be offered enrollment in 
either the World Wide Web-enabled Program or the Fleet Seminar Program.  Both 
of these programs will continue to be offered through the CDE, and all Naval 
officers who are unable to attend the NWC in residence are strongly 
encouraged to enroll as it is extremely important to complete JPME-I 
requirements in a maritime, sea power-focused NWC program.

2.  Request widest dissemination of the above information in activity plans 
of the day, plans of the week, base newspapers, base cable television and any 
other available appropriate media.

3.  Point of contact is Dr. Brad Carter who can be reached at
(401) 841-3277/DSN 841, or via e-mail at cdrom(at)usnwc.edu.

4.  This message is canceled for record purposes on 1 June 2019.

5.  Released by Vice Admiral R. P. Burke, N1.//
