RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE ANNUAL SDAP RECERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR 
FY-12.  THIS PROCESS IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THE NAVY ACCURATELY COMPENSATES 
SAILORS FOR SERVING IN UNIQUELY CHALLENGING ASSIGNMENTS.  PER REFS A AND B, 
COMMANDING OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO ANNUALLY REVIEW AND CERTIFY EACH SAILOR'S 
ENTITLEMENT TO SDAP.  THIS CERTIFICATION IS TO VERIFY EVERY SAILOR ASSIGNED TO 
AN ELIGIBLE BILLET REMAINS QUALIFIED TO FILL THE BILLET AND IS RECEIVING THE 
CORRECT SDAP.  CERTIFICATION SHALL COMMENCE AT THE RELEASE OF THIS NAVADMIN 
THROUGH 31 AUG 2012.  COMMANDS THAT DO NOT COMPLETE THE REQUIRED CERTIFICATION 
WILL HAVE THEIR SDAP TERMINATED RETROACTIVE TO 1 JUNE IAW OPNAVINST 1160.6B 
PARAGRAPH 
10.B.  A COMPLETE LIST OF AUTHORIZED SKILLS AND PAY AMOUNTS CAN BE FOUND IN 
REF C.

2.  ELIGIBILITY.  SAILORS MUST:
    A.  BE QUALIFIED FOR AND SERVING IN AN AUTHORIZED BILLET DESIGNATED FOR 
SDAP AS PER REFS A AND B.    
    B.  NOT BE ASSIGNED IN EXCESS EXCEPT NUCLEAR-TRAINED PERSONNEL MEETING THE 
REQUIREMENTS OF REF A.
3.  PROCEDURES.
    A.  ANY CHANGES TO SDAP RECIPIENTS MUST BE ANNOTATED ON SECTION SP OF THE 
ENLISTED DISTRIBUTION VERIFICATION REPORT (EDVR).  ANNOTATE METHOD BY WHICH 
CHANGES ARE MADE, SUCH AS NAVY STANDARD INTEGRATED PERSONNEL SYSTEM (NSIPS) 
ENTRY ADDING OR DELETING SAILOR AS AN SDAP RECIPIENT.  THE COMMAND IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE SAILOR'S RECORD THROUGH 
THE COMMAND'S SERVICING PERSONNEL SUPPORT DETATCHMENT (PSD).
    B.  THE COMMANDING OFFICER'S (CO'S) ORIGINAL SIGNATURE MUST BE ON THE 
REPORT FORWARDED TO COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-811).  BY DIRECTION SIGNATURES ARE NOT 
AUTHORIZED AND WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  ENDORSEMENT MUST READ:  "I HAVE REVIEWED 
AND CERTIFY MEMBER'S ELIGIBILITY FOR SDAP."
    C.  FORWARD THE CO CERTIFIED SECTION SP OF THE EDVR, BY FAX OR E-MAIL 
(PREFERRED METHOD) TO PSC BELLEW AT:
    FAX (901) 874-3260/2771/DSN 882
E-MAIL: JEFFREY.BELLEW(AT)NAVY.MIL OR EMCM IRISH AT 
DOUGLAS.B.IRISH(AT)NAVY.MIL.

4.  LESSONS LEARNED.
    A.  EACH YEAR COMMANDS SUBMIT THEIR SDAP RECERTIFICATIONS ON 31 AUGUST AND 
DO NOT ALLOW TIME FOR ERRORS TO BE CORRECTED PRIOR TO THE DEADLINE.  IN ORDER 
TO AVOID OVERPAYMENTS AND INADVERTENT STOPPAGE OF SDAP, COMMANDS ARE 
ENCOURAGED TO COMPLETE SDAP RECERTIFICATION EARLY IN THE RECERTIFICATION 
WINDOW (PRIOR TO 
31 JULY).
    B.  COMMANDS DID NOT ENSURE THEIR SAILORS HELD THE REQUIRED NAVY ENLISTED 
CLASSIFICATION (NEC) CODES AND SAILORS WERE BEING PAID INCORRECT SDAP PAY 
LEVELS.  PAYMENT OF SDAP IS NOT AUTHORIZED BASED SOLELY ON PERMANENT CHANGE OF 
STATION ORDERS OR DISTRIBUTION NEC'S. SAILORS MUST HOLD THE REQUIRED NECS.
    C.  COMMANDS DID NOT MAKE THE REQUIRED CORRECTIONS TO MEMBERS' SDAP 
THROUGH THEIR LOCAL PSD UNDER THE MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT CORRECTIONS WOULD BE 
MADE BY NPC DURING THE ANNUAL RECERTIFICATION PROCESS.

5.  COMMANDS CAN CHECK THE STATUS OF THEIR SDAP RECERTIFICATION AT
WWW.PUBLIC.NAVY.MIL/BUPERS-NPC/CAREER/ENLISTEDCAREERADMIN/PAGES/SRB.ASPX.  
COMMANDS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO USE THIS SITE TO ENSURE THEIR SUBORDINATE 
COMMANDS HAVE COMPLETED THE RECERTIFICATION.

OR VIA E-MAIL JEFFREY.BELLEW(AT)NAVY.MIL.
