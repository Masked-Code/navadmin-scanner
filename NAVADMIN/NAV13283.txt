RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes ref (a) and announces the renewal
of Naval Special Operations (NSO) senior enlisted Critical Skills 
Retention Bonus (CSRB) program.  The NSO senior enlisted CSRB is 
part of the Navy's overarching effort to size, shape and stabilize 
the NSO's explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) force.

2.  Program Overview.  This bonus is authorized under ref (b).  
Specific critical Navy Enlisted Classifications (NEC) and approved 
award levels have been prescribed by the office of the Secretary of 
Defense.  Chief of Naval Personnel, NSO Enlisted Community Manager 
(BUPERS-324) will act as the program manager for the NSO EOD senior 
enlisted CSRB program.  All applications for this bonus will be 
submitted to the NSO Enlisted Community Manager (BUPERS-324) for 
processing and tracking.  By law, a member may receive no more than 
$200,000 in CSRB/continuation bonus monies over a career.  Selective
reenlistment bonus (SRB) awards are not included in that cap.  The 
eligibility criteria stated in this NAVADMIN can be changed at any 
time by the program manager if a bonus reduction is warranted based 
on the needs of the NSO EOD community.

3.  Eligibility.  NSO enlisted members with NEC 5337, in paygrades 
E-7 through E-9, who have completed at least 19 and no more than 22 
years of active service who agree for a minimum of a three-year 
service obligation, shall be offered the NSO CSRB.  A subsequent 
CSRB contract may be offered to eligible master EOD technicians who 
previously received a CSRB.  In no case may a CSRB be paid beyond a 
member's 25th year of service (YOS).  Furthermore, applicants must 
meet the following eligibility criteria:
    a.  Be serving on active duty in a regular component.
    b.  Have the commanding officer's favorable recommendation for 
receipt of NSO CSRB.
    c.  Members under an existing CSRB contract are not eligible to 
receive an additional CSRB for service outlined in original contract
agreement.

4.  NSO CSRB contract lengths, payments and active-duty service 
obligations are outlined below:
    a.  Members may sign a contract in their 18th YOS but CSRB 
payments will begin no earlier than the beginning of their 19 YOS.  
At a minimum, member must contract to 22 years of service.  Service 
members in pay grade E-7 may contract for CSRB to 24 YOS, their high
year tenure (HYT) mark.  Service members in pay grades E-8 and E-9 
are eligible to contract to 25 YOS.  If a member serves less than a
full year, the member will be paid the daily rate to the end of 
their eligibility.  Specific bonus amounts are graduated per YOS.  
    b.  Award amounts tabulated represent a member contracting at the 
beginning of the specified YOS.  Actual amounts may vary depending 
on the effective date of the CSRB contract.
Options    YOS    2 Years  3 Years  4 Years  5 Years   6 Years

    c.  NSO CSRB initial contracts shall be for a minimum of three 
years and subsequent contracts must be for a minimum of two years.  
CSRB will not be paid beyond a member's 25th YOS.  A member under 
CSRB contract will not submit a request for retirement or tender a 
resignation with an effective date that is prior to completion of 
the agreement.   Members are authorized early reenlistment in order 
to align CSRB and reenlistment contracts.  Reenlistments and 
extensions may be combined to align service dates for maximum 
opportunity.
    d.  HYT dates are firm and HYT waiver requests will not be 
considered during the NSW CSRB application process.  Members are not
eligible for CSRB payments past their HYT date or beyond 25 years of
active-duty service.

5.  Program Execution.
    a.  Members should submit a letter request for NSO CSRB to the 
program manager 60 to 180 days prior to entering into a NSO CSRB 
contract via their chain of command.
    b.  Service members will receive the bonus in a lump sum payment, 
effective from the date of contract execution.    
    c. CSRB requests for personnel who are being processed for NEC 
removal or restoration will be held in abeyance pending final 
resolution.

6.  CSRB applications shall be submitted via encrypted e-mail to the
program manager or via mail to: 
    Bureau of Personnel THREE (BUPERS-3) 
    5720 Integrity Drive 
    Millington, TN 38055-5402

Military pay system of the Sailor's intent to reenlist.  Until 
Defense Joint Military Pay System can be programmed to accept CSRB 
reenlistment payments, manual processing is required.  Payment 
should post to the member's account by the second pay period 
following the day the program manager receives notification 
of reenlistment contract.  Master Military Pay Account (MMPA) must

tax-free status (if applicable) must post to MMPA prior to final 
submission.

8.  The following documents are required:

preferred) a copy of reenlistment contract and/or extension agreement
with proof of tax-free status if applicable.

9.  Recoupment and Repayment Policy.  Per ref (c), a member of the 
uniformed services who enters into a written agreement with 
specified service conditions for receipt of a bonus is entitled to 
the full amount of the bonus if the member fulfills the conditions 
of that written agreement.  If the member fails to fulfill the 
service conditions specified in the written agreement for pay, then 
the pay may be terminated and the member may be required to repay an
amount equal to the unearned portion of the pay.
