RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces convening of the May 2016 Active Duty
Officer Lateral Transfer/Redesignation Board.  The lateral transfer and
redesignation process is a key tool by which Navy manages the talents of its
officers.  It provides flexibility in officer community manning and improves
the Navys return on investment in officer training and education by
maximizing and utilizing the specialized skillsets of officers throughout
their careers.  As part of the process, applications from qualified
unrestricted line, restricted line, staff corps, and limited duty officers
(LDO) are now being accepted for an Active Duty Officer Lateral
Transfer/Redesignation Board which convenes 31 May 2016.  Full-Time Support
(FTS) and Selected Reserve (SELRES) officers are not eligible to apply for
this board.

2.  In addition to the year group (YG) limitations imposed in paragraph 6,
applicants must also meet eligibility requirements detailed in references (a)
through (c).
    a.  Members who do not meet eligibility requirements per references (a)
through (c) such as time-in-grade, years-of-commissioned service (YCS), or
time-in-service must submit a waiver package in addition to their lateral
transfer/redesignation application.
    b.  Waiver packages must include member's waiver request and commanding
officer's endorsement.  This endorsement is separate from any endorsements
contained in the member's lateral transfer/redesignation application and must
specifically address the eligibility requirement for a waiver.

3.  Submit applications and waiver packages, using the format in reference
(b), to the address below:

7.  Notes:
    a.  Must have Surface Warfare Officers (SWO) qualification completed to
apply for transfer.  Officers under SWO Continuation Pay (SWOCP) or Revised
Junior Critical Skills Retention Bonus (CSRB) contract are not eligible for
transfer until completion of bonus obligation.  SWOs serving under an
agreement for any of the SWO bonuses are eligible to apply to the board if
the board convening date is within one year of satisfaction of the full bonus
obligation.
    b.  Waivers to the requirements of paragraph 4h of reference (b) for
nuclear-trained surface and submarine warfare officers may be considered on a
case-by-case basis.
    c.  Officers screened "not cleared" for their next career milestone are
eligible.
    d.  The YG range provided displays possible opportunities.  Contact your
specific community placement officer with questions regarding quota
availability for each Type/Model/Series/Year Group.  General aviation
officers (1300) are eligible to apply for lateral transfer regardless of
Active Duty Service Obligation (ADSO) from winging.  Aviation officers (131X
and 132X) are eligible to apply for lateral transfer if the officer has
fulfilled ADSO, or will be within 12 months of completing ADSO at the time
the board convenes.  Aviation officers with obligated service as a result of
Aviation Career Continuation Pay (ACCP) are eligible to apply if the officer
will be within 12 months of completing ACCP obligation at the time the Board
convenes.  Additionally, aviation officers with obligated service as a result
of ACCP are eligible to apply if the officer will be within 12 months of
department head tour projected rotation date (PRD) at the time the board
convenes, regardless of contrary ACCP contract language.  Redesignation
immediately following department head tour may result in cancelation of ACCP,
which will be adjudicated by PERS-43.  Aviation lieutenants in a Failure of
Selection (FOS) status to LCDR are eligible to apply regardless of ADSO or
ACCP obligation.  If selected, aviation officers shall not be permitted to
redesignate until completion of ADSO, fulfillment/expiration/cancellation of
ACCP contract, or PRD, as determined by Aviation Officer Community Manager
(BUPERS-313).  Aviation officers in operational flying billets (billet
designator XXX1 or XXX2) will not be permitted to redesignate until vacating
the billet, typically at PRD.  BUPERS-313 authorizes redesignation timing and
PERS-43 is the final approval authority on the above eligibility constraints.
    e.  LDO redesignation requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
considering impact to overall community health.  Nuclear LDO submissions will
not be considered.  All other designators must have completed four years
commissioned service and accepted permanent LDO appointment to LT prior to
lateral transfer/redesignation.  LDO out quotas are extremely limited,
special consideration will be given to officers projected to be statutorily
separated for years of service prior to attaining the rank of commander.
Supply Corps and Information Dominance Corps applicants in YG's 10 and senior
will receive favorable consideration.
    f.  Officers YG-13 and senior seeking lateral transfer into the surface
warfare community are strongly encouraged to contact the SWO community
manager prior to applying in order to discuss critical SWO career milestone
requirements.
    g.  Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the Aerospace
Maintenance Duty Officer Community Manager to discuss milestones and
qualifications commensurate with YG.
    h.  Officers applying for Information Professional (IP), Information
Warfare (IW) or Intelligence communities:  O4 applicants for 1820 with more
than two years time-in-grade should contact the IP community manager to
discuss milestone and performance requirements.  All officers who are either
above or in-zone for FY-17 promotion to LCDR through CAPT will not be
considered for lateral transfer.  IP, IW, and Intel applicants must be
eligible for TS/SCI, submit a Personnel Security Questionnaire (SF-86) per
reference (h), or include a letter from a special security officer (SSO)
indicating successful completion of an SCI pre-screening interview.  IW
applicants that do not hold or are not currently eligible for TS/SCI must
complete an SCI eligibility pre-screening interview with the Fleet Cyber
Command Security Directorate field office at (850) 452-6868 and submit the
results as part of their application.  All applicants must be worldwide

(NAVPERS 1300/16) Parts I and II.  Candidates must have their language
abilities documented by a recent (taken within three years of the board
