RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the guidance for the administration of the 
Spring 2024 (Cycle 114) Navy-wide Advancement Exam (NWAE) for Selected 
Reserve (SELRES) E5 through E7 SELRES candidates, to include those serving on 
voluntary recall, mobilization, or as canvasser recruiters.

2.  In line with references (a) and (b), the Enlisted Advancement Worksheet 
(EAW) is the authoritative source of all data used to determine cycle 114 
eligibility.  Commands are to accurately validate, complete, and finalize all 
EAWs in the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).  EAW 
discrepancies may be addressed via the Post-Examination Administration 
comment (PAC) process after worksheets are locked for the cycle.

3.  Timeline:
    a.  31 December 2023:  Professional Military Knowledge - Eligibility Exam 
(PMK-EE) completion deadline.  In line with reference (c), PMK-EE remains

are still bound by the same PMK-EE deadline as regular TIR candidates.
    d.  High-Year Tenure (HYT).  In line with reference (e), all SELRES are 
automatically approved to continue service through 30 September 2024 and all

Reserve prior to mandated HYT are not eligible to advance.
