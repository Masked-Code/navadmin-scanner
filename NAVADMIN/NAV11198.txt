4.  LESSONS LEARNED.
    A.  EACH YEAR COMMANDS SUBMIT THEIR SDAP RECERTIFICATIONS ON 31 AUG AND DO 
NOT ALLOW TIME FOR ERRORS TO BE CORRECTED PRIOR TO THE DEADLINE.  IN ORDER TO 
AVOID OVERPAYMENTS AND INADVERTENT STOPPAGE OF SDAP, COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED 
TO COMPLETE SDAP RECERTIFICATION EARLY IN THE RECERTIFICATION WINDOW (PRIOR TO 
31 JULY).
    B.  COMMANDS DID NOT ENSURE THEIR SAILORS HELD THE REQUIRED NAVY ENLISTED 
CLASSIFICATION (NEC) CODES AND SAILORS WERE BEING PAID INCORRECT SDAP PAY 
LEVELS.  PAYMENT OF SDAP IS NOT AUTHORIZED BASED SOLELY ON PERMANENT CHANGE OF 
STATION ORDERS OR DISTRIBUTION NEC'S.  SAILORS MUST HOLD THE REQUIRED NECS.
    C.  COMMANDS DID NOT MAKE THE REQUIRED CORRECTIONS TO MEMBERS SDAP THROUGH 
THEIR LOCAL PSD UNDER THE MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT CORRECTIONS WOULD BE MADE BY 
NPC DURING THE ANNUAL RECERTIFICATION PROCESS.
