RMKS/1.  This Information Warfare Type Commanders (TYCOMs) coordinated 
NAVADMIN mandates compliance with reference (a) and issues further guidance 
mandating Manpower Budget Submitting Offices (BSOs) to update occupational 
standard job codes and applicable Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) 
requirements within the Total Force Manpower Management System (TFMMS) for 
the Information Systems Technician (IT) rating.

2.  Background.  Per references (b) and (d), all ITs are part of the core 
Department of Defense Cyber Workforce Framework (DCWF) in either Cyber IT or 
Cybersecurity Workforce (CSWF).
    a.  Reference (a) directed Navy Manpower Offices to update Commercial 
Activities Function (CAF) codes for all Cyberspace workforce billets and 
reconcile military billet coding in TFMMS IAW references (b) through (d).
    b.  Reference (e), IT Rating Occupation Standards (OCCSTDs) were updated 
in October 2018 to align with the DCWF.  Update included IT job codes and 
work roles increasing from four to nine.  Approximately 13,640 unique IT 
billets cited in TFMMS database are using one of the four old IT job codes.
    c.  A review of IT billets Navy-wide conducted by Deputy Chief of Naval 
Operations for Information Warfare (OPNAV N2N6), Bureau of Naval Personnel 
(BUPERS-32), and Naval Information Forces (NAVIFOR) revealed a significant 
number of NEC to OCCSTD job codes and work role discrepancies and invalid 
Cyberspace CAF codes.

3.  Crosswalk Tool.  To assist the Manpower BSOs in validating Navy -wide IT 
manpower and training requirements, NAVIFOR created a CAF code to job code to 
applicable NEC and crosswalk tool that lists appropriate job code to CAF 
coding.  This was completed as a result of actions taken to complete 
reference (a) tasking.  The crosswalk tool is available for download at the 
NAVIFOR CSWF page at 
https://usff.navy.deps.mil/sites/navifor/manpower/cswf/sitepages/home.aspx

4.  Mandated Action.  Manpower BSOs are directed to work with applicable 
stakeholders (Commands, TYCOMs, etc.) to complete tasking IAW reference (f).
    a.  Step 1.  Utilizing crosswalk tool, align all IT rating billets with 
appropriate CAF/NECs/OCCSTD job codes.
    b.  Step 2.  Generate Manpower Change Request (MCR) to implement 
necessary changes in TFMMS.

5.  For CAF, NEC, and OCCSTD job code questions contact NAVIFOR, BUPERS-32, 
and OPNAV N2N6 POCs.

6.  Report completion of TFMMS update to NAVIFOR and OPNAV N2N6 POCs no later 
than 90 days from release of this message.

7.  Released by VADM Matthew J. Kohler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
