RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces changes to the processes in references (a) 
and (b) for submitting a Post-9/11 GI Bill Transfer of Education Benefits 
(TEB) request.

2.  This new policy does not apply to:
    a.  Sailors who already have an approved TEB request in Defense Manpower 
Data Center (DMDC) milConnect.
    b.  Sailors who wish to add a dependent to an already approved TEB 
request or modify the months of benefits allocated to dependents.

3.  Updated TEB process effective 1 October 2018:
    a.  An online, self-service Statement of Understanding (SOU) replaces the 
Administrative Remarks (NAVPERS 1070-613) (i.e., Page 13) pre-requisite for 
all Selected Reserve (SELRES) Sailors and all officers in references (a) and 
(b).
    b.  This SOU must be completed by all Sailors prior to submitting a TEB 
application.
    c.  Sailors may access SOU via MyNavyPortal or by using a Common Access 
Card via the My Education web site at 
https://myeducation.netc.navy.mil/webta/home.
    d.  Upon completion of the SOU, Sailors will receive a link to DMDC 
milConnect portal to submit their TEB application.
    e.  To ensure prompt feedback on TEB applications, Sailors should verify 
email information when completing the SOU.

4.  Enlisted Sailors must:
    a.  Ensure at least four years remaining on current enlistment contract, 
including authorized extensions.  Sailors with less than four years remaining 
to their End of Active Obligated Service (EAOS) or soft EAOS must take action 
to incur required obligated service.
See guidance in paragraph 7.
    b.  Check their Electronic Service Record (ESR) to ensure EAOS correctly 
reflects eligible re-enlistment and/or extension dates.
    c.  Complete the new SOU.
    d.  Follow the link provided to DMDC milConnect to submit TEB 
application.
    e.  Submit their TEB application no more than 30 calendar days following 
a 4-year re-enlistment or extending to incur 48 months of total obligated 
service.
    f.  If re-enlistment or extension does not reflect in the ESR within 25 
days, complete the SOU and submit the TEB application in DMDC milConnect.  If 
rejected, e-mail the appropriate point of contact in paragraph 9 when the ESR 
reflects the correct EAOS.
    g.  Pursuant to reference (a), in situations where communications may 
hinder a successful TEB submission (e.g.,
deployment) and to avoid surpassing the 30-day grace period, Sailors should 
e-mail the appropriate point of contact in paragraph 9 in advance and request 
their TEB request be held in a pending status until the ESR reflects the 
correct EAOS.

5.  Officers must:
    a.  Complete the new SOU.
    b.  Follow the link provided to DMDC milConnect to submit TEB 
application.

6.  As directed in reference (c), as of 12 July 2019, any member who has 
greater than 16 years of service will no longer be eligible to transfer 
education benefits to their dependents, unless they are recipients of the 
Purple Heart pursuant to reference (e).  Take action now to avoid losing this 
opportunity.

7.  Pursuant to reference (d), enlisted Sailors no longer require permission 
from Navy Personnel Command (PERS 811) to re-enlist more than 12 months prior 
to their EAOS.

8.  Effectively immediately, pursuant to reference (e), recipients of the 
Purple Heart are eligible to transfer unused Post-9/11 GI Bill education 
benefits to one or more qualifying family members, regardless of whether the 
service member has:
    a.  Already served six years of service in the armed forces and entered 
into an agreement to serve at least four more years as a uniformed service 
member.
    b.  Already served more than 16 years of total creditable service in the 
Military Services.
    c.  All other TEB requirements in law, Department of Defense, and Navy 
policy remain in effect.

9.  Points of contact:
    a.  OPNAV N127 Policy:  Mr. Jim Johnson, (703)604-5256/DSN 664 or 
james.p.johnson(at)navy.mil.
    b.  Active Duty and FTS Sailors may submit inquiries to My Navy Career 
Center at 1-833-330-6622 or askmncc(at)navy.mil.
    c.  SELRES Sailors may submit inquiries to Commander, Navy Reserve Forces 
Command (N1C2) at 1-800-621-8853 or cnrfc_post911gibill(at)navy.mil.

10.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
