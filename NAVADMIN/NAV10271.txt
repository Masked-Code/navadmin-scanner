SUBJ/LUMP SUM PAY INCREASE FOR AUGUST 2010 ADVANCEES//

RMKS/1.  A COMPUTER SYSTEM FAILURE AT THE NAVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING 
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY CENTER (NETPDTC) HAS PREVENTED 
THE AUGUST PAY INCREASE FROM BEING INCLUDED IN MID-MONTH PAY FOR A 
SMALL GROUP OF ENLISTED SAILORS ADVANCED THIS MONTH.  AUGUST MID-MONTH 
PAY IS OTHERWISE UNAFFECTED FOR THE BALANCE OF THE NAVY.

2.  SAILORS WHOSE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ADVANCEMENT IS IN AUGUST 2010 WILL 
RECEIVE THEIR ENTIRE MONTHLY PAY INCREASE FOR AUGUST IN THE END-OF-
MONTH PAY DISBURSEMENT.  THIS AFFECTS THOSE ADVANCED TO PAYGRADES E4-E6 
FROM THE MARCH 2010 (CYCLE 207) ADVANCEMENT EXAM CYCLE AND THOSE 
ADVANCED TO E7-E9 FROM THE FY10 BOARDS (CYCLES 205 & 206).  AFFECTED 
SAILORS WILL STILL BE PAID AUGUST MID-MONTH, BUT AT THE PREVIOUS PAY 
GRADE.  THE PAY INCREASE ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW PAY GRADE WILL BE 
ACHIEVED THROUGH A ONE-TIME LUMP SUM PAYMENT IN END-OF-MONTH PAY.  
FUTURE PAY AT THE NEW PAY GRADE WILL BE SPREAD EVENLY ACROSS BI-MONTHLY 
PAY.  AFFECTED PERSONNEL SHOULD CONTACT THEIR SUPPORTING PSD OR THEIR 
SHIP'S PERSONNEL OFFICE IF CLARIFICATION OF FUTURE BI-MONTHLY PAY 
AMOUNTS IS REQUIRED.
