SUBJ/PARTICIPATION IN SHIP VISITS AND TOURS BY DISABLED VISITORS// 
RMKS/1. WHEN CONDUCTING SHIP VISITS AND TOURS FOR MEMBERS OF THE 
GENERAL PUBLIC, EVERY CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ALLOW ACCESS BY 
DISABLED VISITORS. WHILE U.S. NAVY WARSHIPS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE 
ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA), 
PARTICIPATION BY DISABLED VISITORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ON A CASE-BY-
CASE BASIS BASED ON THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH VISITOR AND VISIT.
2. DISABLED VISITORS MAY PARTICIPATE IN VISITS AND TOURS, PROVIDED THAT 
PARTICIPATION DOES NOT POSE AN UNACCEPTABLE RISK TO THE SAFETY OF THE 
DISABLED VISITOR. COMMAND SHALL EVALUATE PARTICIPATION IN SHIPBOARD 
VISITS OR TOURS BY DISABLED VISITORS ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, USING THE 
PRINCIPLES OF OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT.  SUCH FACTORS AS 
ACCESSIBILITY, MANEUVERABILITY, CLEARANCES AND SPACE ALLOWANCES, THE 
CONDITION OF SUCH SURFACES AS DECKS, PASSAGEWAYS, AND GANGWAYS, 
AVAILABILITY OF ACCESSIBLE RESTROOM FACILITIES, AVAILABILITY OF 
EMERGENCY PERSONNEL, PROTRUDING OR HAZARDOUS OBJECTS, ABILITY OF THE 
VISITOR TO DETECT WARNINGS, AND EASE OF EVACUATION IN AN EMERGENCY ARE 
SOME FACTORS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. IF ASSISTANCE OF AN AIDE WOULD 
ALLOW THE DISABLED VISITOR TO PARTICIPATE IN THE VISIT OR TOUR, 
PARTICIPATION OF THE AIDE MAY BE ALLOWED, BUT THE VISITOR IS SOLEY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING THE AIDE. IF IT APPEARS THAT A DISABLED 
VISITOR MAY SAFELY PARTICIPATE IN SOME BUT NOT ALL OF A VISIT OR TOUR, 
THE DISABLED VISITOR MAY BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PORTION OF 
THE VISIT OR TOUR THAT IS SAFELY ACCESSIBLE FOR THE DISABLED VISITOR. 
ULTIMATELY, THE AUTHORITY AND DISCRETION TO DENY A DISABLED VISITOR 
PARTICIPATION IN A SHIPBOARD VISIT OR TOUR THAT IS OTHERWISE OPEN TO 
THE GENERAL PUBLIC RESTS WITH THE COMMANDING OFFICER OR, IF SO 
DELEGATED, THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OR COMMAND DUTY OFFICER.
3. IF A DISABLED VISITOR IS DENIED PARTICIPATION IN A SHIP VISIT OR 
TOUR, THE REASONS FOR THE DENIAL MUST BE CLEARLY EXPLAINED TO THE
DISABLED VISITOR BY A MEMBER OF THE COMMAND LEADERSHIP TEAM.
COMMANDS SHOULD CONSIDER ALTERNATE VISIT OR TOUR ROUTES, PHOTOGRAPHS, 
VIDEOS, OR NARRATED SLIDE SHOWS DISPLAYED PIER SIDE AS ALTERNATIVES.
