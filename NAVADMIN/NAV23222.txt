RMKS/1. The Air Traffic Control Association (ATCA) will hold the Joint-
Service Air Traffic Control (ATC) Symposium in Myrtle Beach, SC at the 
Sheraton Convention Center from 14-16 May 2024. This forum provides a vehicle 
for senior military and civilian professionals to enlighten, inspire, enhance 
retention, and educate E-4 through E-6 DoD air traffic controllers on the 
technological advances, operational enhancements, and policy changes that 
have taken place within the air traffic control profession. The event is a 
combination of briefs, panels, working groups, and industry interaction. 
Industry representatives for air traffic management equipment, simulators, 
and software provide displays that serve to educate and prepare controllers 
for future opportunities and challenges to military air traffic control. 
 
Topics include: 
- The Future of Naval Aviation and Air Force ATC 
- US Navy and USMC Air Traffic Control Strategic Plan and Evolution Roadmap 
- The National Airspace System 
- ATC Equipment and Technology 
- Landing Zone Operations 
- Career Development and Advancement Opportunities 
- Training and Readiness Discussions 
 
2. Primary goals are to reinforce the professional excellence of the air 
traffic control community and enhance retention within the critical E-4 
through E-6 paygrades. While the focus is on our active duty members, all 
DoN, USAF, Army, civil service, retired, enlisted, and officer ATC 
professionals are cordially invited to attend. 
 
3. Per reference (a) and (b), Commanding Officers may issue orders for 
attendance at government expense after determining that the expenses, 
including fees, travel costs, and other costs attributable to participation, 
justify the objectives to be achieved. TAD orders may cover expenses to 
support attendance and participation at the conference including 
transportation and per diem per reference (b). 
 
4. If funds are not available, permissive TAD orders may be issued. 
Use of available government transportation and carpooling is encouraged to 
enhance conference participation and to minimize travel expenses. Commands 
may also reduce costs by using double occupancy for lodging. Rental cars are 
highly discouraged and unnecessary for symposium participants. Participants 
flying to the symposium should use a taxi or ridesharing to the hotel.
