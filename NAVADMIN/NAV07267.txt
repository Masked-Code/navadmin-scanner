TO THE CONVENING DATE OF THE BOARD.  WHILE REQUESTS FOR RETIREMENTS 
EFFECTIVE AFTER 1 OCT 08 WILL BE ACCEPTED; THESE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE 
APPROVED UNTIL AFTER THE SER BOARD RESULTS ARE APPROVED IN JAN 08, AND 
THESE OFFICERS WILL REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE FY-08 SER 
BOARDS.  ONCE A RETIREMENT REQUEST IS APPROVED, IT CANNOT BE WITHDRAWN 
WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.

ORDERS, WHETHER LOCATED OVERSEAS OR IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES 
(INCONUS).
     A.  OFFICERS INCONUS IN RECEIPT OF COST ORDERS DIRECTING 
DETACHMENT BETWEEN 1 JAN 08 AND 1 MAR 08 WILL BE NOTIFIED BY THEIR 
DETAILER IF ORDERS ARE NOT TO BE EXECUTED.
     B.  OFFICERS WHO ARE IN OVERSEAS AREAS IN RECEIPT OF COST ORDERS 
FOR AN INTRA/INTER THEATER OR CONUS MOVE WITH DATE OF ESTIMATED 
ROTATION BETWEEN 1 JAN 08 AND 1 MAR 08 HAVE TWO
OPTIONS:
         OPTION 1:  EXTEND OVERSEAS UNTIL APPROX 15 APR 08.
         OPTION 2:  EXECUTE THEIR CURRENT ORDERS.
     C.  OFFICERS OVERSEAS WITH DATES OF ESTIMATED ROTATION OF
1 MAR 08 OR LATER AND SELECTED FOR SER WILL CONTINUE IN THEIR PRESENT 
DUTY ASSIGNMENT UNTIL THEIR MANDATORY RETIREMENT DATE, UNLESS EARLIER 
RETIREMENT IS REQUESTED AND APPROVED.  NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND AND 
PARENT COMMANDS WILL ATTEMPT TO ACCOMMODATE INDIVIDUAL DESIRES OF 
RETIRING OFFICERS.
     D.  OFFICERS ELIGIBLE FOR SER WHO ARE OVERSEAS, AND ARE AWAITING 
ARRIVAL OF FAMILY MEMBERS, MAY WANT TO CONSIDER DEFERRING FAMILY MEMBER 
MOVES UNTIL SER RESULTS ARE KNOWN.
     E.  THESE GUIDELINES ARE IN EFFECT UNTIL BOARD RESULTS ARE 
APPROVED.  ONCE SER RESULTS ARE APPROVED, INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS CAN BE 
MADE REGARDING TRANSFER DATES, PERMISSIVE TEMPORARY DUTY AND LEAVE.  
DUE TO THE SHORT TIME AVAILABLE FOR OFFICERS TO PLAN FOR TRANSITION TO 
RETIREMENT, COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED, WITHIN OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS, TO 
BE AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE IN AUTHORIZING PERMISSIVE TEMPORARY DUTY, IN 
ADDITION TO TERMINAL LEAVE, TO ASSIST OFFICERS MAKING THIS CHANGE. 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATION IN THIS REGARD SHOULD BE GIVEN TO OFFICERS WHO 
ARE NOTIFIED OF SER WHILE IN OVERSEAS ASSIGNMENTS OR WHILE DEPLOYED AT 
SEA. 
LIMITED EXTENSIONS ON ACTIVE DUTY MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR OFFICERS 
SELECTED FOR RETIREMENT WHILE STATIONED OVERSEAS OR THOSE DEPLOYED FOR 
MORE THAN 90 DAYS BETWEEN THE PERIOD OF NOTIFICATION AND THEIR 
MANDATORY RETIREMENT DATE.
8.  COMMANDER, NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND, OFFICER RETIREMENTS BRANCH
(PERS-4822) PERSONNEL ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER GENERAL QUESTIONS AT
(901) 874-3178/DSN: 882. 
9.  SER IS NEVER A STEP WE CONSIDER LIGHTLY, HOWEVER, GIVEN OUR CURRENT 
GRADE IMBALANCE, IT IS A NECESSARY ACTION WE MUST TAKE FOR THE LONG-
TERM HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY.  THE NECESSITY FOR FY-08 SER BOARDS MAY 
BE ELIMINATED, OR THE NUMBER OF SELECTEES REDUCED, IF ADDITIONAL FY-08 
CHAPLAIN CORPS CAPTAINS AND COMMANDERS REQUEST VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT.
10.  WE WISH TO MINIMIZE OUR SER REQUIREMENTS WHILE CONTINUING TO MEET 
OUR STRENGTH GOALS.  FOR THOSE CHAPLAIN CORPS OFFICERS CONSIDERING 
VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT IN FY-08, I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUBMIT YOUR 
REQUESTS IMMEDIATELY, SO WE CAN MORE ACCURATELY PLAN OUR FORCE 
STRUCTURE FOR FY-08.
