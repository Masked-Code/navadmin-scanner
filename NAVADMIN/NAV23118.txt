RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Blended Retirement System (BRS) mid-
career continuation pay (CP) rates for Calendar Year 2024 (CY- 24).  The CY-
24 CP rates are:
a.  Total CP for Active Component is two and a half times the monthly basic 
pay for a Service Member of that grade who has reached
12 years of service (YOS).
b.  Total CP for Training and Administration of the Reserves is two and a 
half times the monthly basic pay for a Service Member of that grade who has 
reached 12 YOS.
c.  Total CP for Selected Reserve is half the monthly basic pay for a Service 
Member of that grade who has reached 12 YOS.

2.  In line with references (a) and (b), Service Members who want to receive 
the mid-career CP are reminded that they must be enrolled in BRS and request 
CP before 12 YOS.  The CP election is made via Navy Standard Integrated 
Personnel System (NSIPS) which can be accessed via MyNavy Portal Quick Links.  
For Service Members who have provided NSIPS with an up-to-date email address, 
NSIPS will send an email notification of CP eligibility at 11 years 6 months 
YOS, 11 years 9 months YOS and a final reminder at 11 years 11 months YOS.
Service Members who are unable to elect CP through NSIPS may manually elect 
CP through their command career counselor.  CP information to include details 
on electing CP can be found in references (c) and (d).  A copy of the CY-24 
CP rate memorandum can be found at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-
Services/Culture-Resilience/Family-Readiness/Personal-Financial-Mgmt/.  For 
any other CP issues, Service Members should reach out to MyNavy Career Center 
at 833-330-MNCC or askmncc.fct@navy.mil.

3.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
