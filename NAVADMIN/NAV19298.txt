RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the establishment of the Force Master Chief, 
Command Master Chief (CMDCM) and Command Senior chief
(CMDCS) service ratings for the Reserve Component (RC).  Sailor 2025 focuses 
on improving the ability of our Navy to develop, reward and retain the force 
of tomorrow.  The change is in direct support of Sailor 2025 and rating 
modernization initiatives to continue to empower Sailors and expand 
professional development opportunities.
The command leadership triad is also strengthened by offering the opportunity 
for our senior enlisted leaders to gain additional command leadership 
experience and increased flexibility in assignments between the Active 
Component and RC.

2.  Command Rating Eligibility.  Sailors who possess Navy enlisted 
classification (NEC) code 8CMC or 8CSC, or those selected from the
FY-20 CMDCM or CMDCS Selection Board.
    a.  Eligible Sailors are required to submit an Enlisted Personnel Action 
Request (NAVPERS 1306/7) to the Full-Time Support
(FTS) CMDCM detailer or Selected Reserves (SELRES) assignment coordinator, no 
later than 10 January 2020 to decline conversion to the command rating.  If 
the NAVPERS 1306/7 is not submitted, conversion to command will process 
automatically.
    b.  Sailors who decline the command rating conversion will complete their 
current command tour then be made available to their respective source rating 
detailer at their projected rotation date.
NEC code 8CMC or 8CSC will be removed for those Sailors who decline the 
command rating once their tour is completed, except for closed- loop 
communities (Special Warfare, Seabees).

3.  Rating Badge.  The CMDCM and CMDCS rating badges are unchanged as a 
result of this announcement.  Reference (a) is the guidance for authorized 
wear.

4.  CMDCM and CMDCS advancement and selection board timelines.
    a.  27 January 2020.  The annual Command Lateral Conversion Selection 
Board will be held for source rating master chiefs and senior chiefs who 
applied for the Command Senior Enlisted Leader Program in line with reference 
(b).
    b.  3-12 March 2020.  The first Reserve selection board for advancement 
in the command rating will be added to the annual E-8 and E-9 Reserve 
Advancement Selection Board.  Eligible CMDCS who meet time-in-rate will 
compete for CMDCM.

5.  Sea/Shore Rotation (SSR).  FTS SSR policy will not change with this 
update.  Drilling SELRES assignment policies remain unchanged.

6.  Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) and Special Duty Assignment Pay
