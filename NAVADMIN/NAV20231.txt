SUBJ/FLEXIBILITY FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020 SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION RESPONSE AND 
SUICIDE PREVENTION GENERAL MILITARY TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces flexibility in Fiscal Year 2020 Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) and Suicide Prevention trainings.  
Both of these trainings are essential contributions to Navy Readiness and the 
Culture of Excellence.  Even with constraints of the current pandemic and 
limited opportunities to gather in groups for training evolutions, these two 
subjects still remain especially critical to the overall health of the Fleet.

2.  The safety of our personnel remains paramount.  The recommended method of 
delivery for SAPR and Suicide Prevention annual training is via face-to-face, 
small group facilitated discussions with social distance measures applied.  
While this remains the most effective lesson delivery method, this NAVADMIN 
authorizes Commanding Officers to adapt or modify fiscal year 2020 SAPR and 
Suicide Prevention General Military Training (GMT) delivery methods 
consistent with coronavirus mitigation procedures and operational commitments 
to meet these training requirements.  If in-person/face-to-face delivery is 
not feasible, the preferred alternative is facilitated small group training 
via teleconference, Defense Collaboration Services, or Commercial Virtual 
Remote Microsoft Teams.  SAPR and Suicide Prevention training is not 
authorized for facilitation through non-Department of Defense approved 
collaborative technology (e.g. Facebook, Zoom, etc.).  During this pandemic 
environment, facilitated small group training using approved video 
conferencing technology is considered *face-to-face,* fully meeting these 
training requirements.  Senior commanders have the authority to issue 
guidance that is more restrictive to their subordinate commands.

3.  Current SAPR and Suicide Prevention training materials are not designed 
for individual/self-study training.  As such, using methods other than 
facilitated, small group sessions will be challenging.
Feedback, lessons learned or recommendations for more effective training 
delivery is encouraged.
    a.  SAPR training materials are located on MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/general-skills-training/gmt (high bandwidth 
mode and Common Access Card authentication are required).
All SAPR training materials are For Official Use Only.  SAPR training 
material shall not be loaded onto publicly accessible websites (i.e. YouTube, 
Facebook, etc.).  Additionally, the following disclaimer should be added at 
the beginning of each SAPR training session that is not conducted in person:
    *We understand that participating in SAPR training can be difficult.  If 
you need advocacy support at any time, please contact the on-call Sexual 
Assault Response Coordinator or Victims Advocate
(SARC/VA) at [please insert contact information for the local SARC/VA] or the 
Department of Defense Safe helpline at www.safehelpline.org or 877-995-5247.*
    b.  Link to the Suicide Prevention training materials is located at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/general-skills-training/gmt.

redirected to BUPERS NPC to download associated training materials.

5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until 30 September 2020 or 
superseded, whichever occurs first.
