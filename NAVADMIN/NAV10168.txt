RMKS/1.  REF A ANNOUNCED THE ADMIRAL STAN ARTHUR AWARDS FOR LOGISTICS 
EXCELLENCE PROGRAM FOR CY2009.  THIS AWARD RECOGNIZES MILITARY AND 
CIVILIAN LOGISTICIANS WHO EPITOMIZE EXCELLENCE IN LOGISTICS PLANNING 
AND EXECUTION.  A FLAG/SES PANEL REVIEWED CANDIDATE NOMINATIONS AND 
SELECTED THE WINNERS THAT MERIT SPECIAL RECOGNITION.  I AM PLEASED TO 
ANNOUNCE THE FOLLOWING CY2009 WINNERS:
A.  THE CY2009 MILITARY LOGISTICIAN OF THE YEAR IS CDR THOMAS GRAEBNER 
ASSIGNED TO FLEET INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY CENTER, PUGET SOUND.  CDR GRAEBNER 
PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN ESTABLISHING THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS-RELATED 
MATERIAL PROGRAM FOR THE NAVY AND LAID A FOUNDATION FOR THE PROPER 
CONTROL AND OVERSIGHT OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL THAT HAS BECOME THE MODEL 
FOR THE ENTIRE NAVY SUPPLY SYSTEM.  AS A RESULT OF HIS EXTRAORDINARY 
PERSONAL EFFORT THE NAVY HAS RETAINED A CREDIBLE NUCLEAR DETERRENT 
THREAT AND PROTECTED NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS.
B.  THE CY2009 CIVILIAN LOGISTICIAN OF THE YEAR IS MR. DANIEL HOHMAN, 
ASSIGNED TO NAVAL INVENTORY CONTROL POINT, PHILADELPHIA. OVER THE PAST 
YEAR MR. HOHMAN COORDINATED ACTIONS WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF CUSTOMERS AND 
ACTIVITIES TO HELP STANDARDIZE VARIOUS ASPECTS REGARDING CONTRACTUAL, 
QUALITY, AND LOGISTICS FACTORS INVOLVED IN PROCURING BOTH NUCLEAR LEVEL 
I AND NON-NUCLEAR LEVEL I MATERIALS, COMPONENTS AND ASSEMBLIES.  HIS 
EFFORTS TO CONSOLIDATE NUCLEAR AND LEVEL I/SUBSAFE WELD FILLER MATERIAL 
NSNS, STANDARDIZE LEVEL I VENDOR AUDITS, DEVELOP A NAVY-WIDE NUCLEAR 
APPROVED VENDOR LIST, ESTABLISH A QUARTERLY QUALITY FORUM WITH DCMA, 
AND RESOLVE A MYRIAD OF INDIVIDUAL SPARES QUALITY ISSUES THROUGH THE 
APPLICATION OF INNOVATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING APPROACHES GAINED 
EFFICIENCIES AND SAVED OVER 1 MILLION DOLLARS.
C.  THE CY2009 ACQUISITION LOGISTICS TEAM OF THE YEAR IS THE F402 
AIRCRAFT ENGINE LOGISTICS TEAM FROM NAVAL INVENTORY CONTROL POINT 
PHILADELPHIA.  THE TEAM'S INNOVATIVE APPROACH REDESIGNED THE WAY F402 
ENGINE COMPONENTS ARE ACQUIRED, MANAGED, OVERHAULED, AND MAINTAINED.  
THE EFFORT ALLOWS THE F402 AND THE AV8B HARRIER TO DELIVER MAXIMUM 
COMBAT AIRCRAFT AND MEET CNO MANDATED READINESS LEVELS WHILE MINIMIZING 
OPERATOR MAINTENANCE.  THE TEAM DEVELOPED AN INNOVATIVE SUPPLY SUPPORT 
SUSTAINMENT SOLUTION THAT HAS DELIVERED AN UNPRECEDENTED 170 RFI 
ENGINES TO THE FLEET.
D.  THE CY2009 OPERATIONAL LOGISTICS TEAM OF THE YEAR IS THE COMMANDER 
SECOND FLEET, LOGISTICS READINESS CENTER.  BY BRIDGING THE INFORMATION 
GAP IN READINESS REPORTING AND SYNCHRONIZING SORTS AND CASREP REPORTING 
THE C2F N4 SHOP HAS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED THE COMMANDER'S ABILITY TO 
EFFECTIVELY EMPLOY FORCES.  ADDITIONALLY, N4'S EXPANSION OF MATERIAL 
SUPPORT TO FOREIGN NAVAL UNITS HAS SERVED AS A FORCE MULTIPLIER BY 
ENABLING OUR VISITORS TO BRIDGE OPERATIONAL GAPS WITHIN THE C2F AREA OF 
RESPONSIBILITY.

2.  AWARD LEVELS FOR CY2009 ARE $5,000 EACH FOR THE MILITARY AND THE 
CIVILIAN LOGISTICIAN OF THE YEAR AND $10,000 FOR THE TEAM AWARDS.
