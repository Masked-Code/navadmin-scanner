RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN SUPERCEDES REF A.

2.  THIS MESSAGE IS TO ENSURE THAT SAILORS, CAREER COUNSELORS AND 
COMMAND LEADERSHIP ARE AWARE OF THE PROCESS TO OBTAIN INVOLUNTARY 
SEPARATION PAY (ISP).  THE INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN IS 
APPLICABLE TO ALL SAILORS INVOLUNTARILY RELEASED FROM ACTIVE DUTY; 
HOWEVER, THIS MESSAGE IS BEING TRANSMITTED TO ENSURE CLARITY AND 
TIMELY ACTION FOR ENLISTED RETENTION BOARD (ERB) AFFECTED SAILORS.

3.  REF B OUTLINES THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR ISP.  THESE 
REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE:
    A.  INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION
    B.  HONORABLE DISCHARGE CHARACTERIZATION
    C.  COMPLETION OF AT LEAST 6 BUT LESS THAN 20 YEARS OF ACTIVE 
SERVICE
    D.  ENTRY INTO A THREE-YEAR WRITTEN AGREEMENT TO SERVE IN EITHER 
THE SELECTED RESERVE (SELRES) - (COMPOSED OF DRILLING RESERVISTS IN 
A PAY STATUS WHO TYPICALLY DRILL ONE WEEKEND A MONTH AND TWO-WEEKS 
A YEAR) OR THE INDIVIDUAL READY RESERVE (IRR) - (COMPOSED OF 
NON-DRILLING RESERVISTS IN A NON-PAY STATUS).

4.  REF C PROVIDES SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS AND OUTLINES THE PROCESS 
AND PROCEDURES INVOLUNTARILY RELEASED SAILORS SEEKING ISP MUST 
COMPLETE.  CONTACT/PROCESS INFORMATION FOR AFFILIATION IN EITHER THE 
SELECTED RESERVE (DRILLING STATUS) OR INDIVIDUAL READY RESERVE 
(NON-DRILLING STATUS) FOLLOWS:
    A.  SELRES - DRILLING STATUS - AFFILIATION PROCESS.  ERB 
SEPARATING SAILORS COMPLETE THE NAVPERS 1070/613 AGREEMENT AND APPLY 
FOR SELRES QUOTAS AND AFFILIATION VIA FLEETRIDE/PERFORM TO SERVE 
(PTS) REGARDLESS OF ENLISTED ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE.  SAILORS MAY 
APPLY FOR "IN-RATE ONLY," "IN-RATE WILLING TO CONVERT," AND "CONVERT 
ONLY" OPTIONS.  ONCE IN RECEIPT OF A SELRES QUOTA, SAILORS WILL BE 
AFFILIATED WITH THE SELECTED RESERVE VIA THE CAREER TRANSITION OFFICE 
(CTO).  IF A SELRES QUOTA IS NOT AVAILABLE, NAVPERSCOM (PERS-9X) WILL 
FORWARD NAVPERS 1070/613 "AGREEMENT TO SERVE" AND THE DD 214 WORKSHEET 
TO NAVPERSCOM (PERS-93) FOR SCREENING WITH IRR AFFILIATION.
    B.  IRR - NON DRILLING STATUS - AFFILIATION PROCESS.  ERB 
SEPARATING SAILORS WHO DO NOT WISH TO AFFILIATE IN THE SELRES MUST 
AFFILIATE WITH THE IRR TO RECEIVE ISP.  PRIOR TO THE MEMBER'S 
DISCHARGE FROM ACTIVE DUTY AND PRIOR TO A PAYMENT OF SEPARATION PAY, 
THE SAILOR'S COMMAND WILL FORWARD THE SIGNED ORIGINAL OF THE NAVPERS 
1070/613 "AGREEMENT TO SERVE" TO SUPPORTING PERSONNEL OFFICE OR 
PERSONNEL SUPPORT DETACHMENT (PSD) FOR COMPLETION OF DD FORM 214 
WORKSHEET.  THE PERSONNEL OFFICE/PSD WILL FORWARD THE DD 214 WORKSHEET 
TO THE SAILOR'S COMMAND FOR VERIFICATION BY THE MEMBER.  UPON 
COMPLETION OF THE DD 214 VERIFICATION, THE SAILOR'S COMMAND WILL THEN 
FORWARD A SIGNED COPY OF THE NAVPERS 1070/613 "AGREEMENT TO SERVE" AND 
VERIFIED DD 214 WORKSHEET TO NAVPERSCOM (PERS-93).  IF THE MEMBER IS 
QUALIFIED, PERS-93 WILL PREPARE THE IRR CONTRACT AND RETURN IT TO THE 
SAILOR FOR SIGNATURE.  IF THE MEMBER IS NOT QUALIFIED, FAILURE TO BE 
ACCEPTED IN THE READY RESERVE DOES NOT AFFECT A MEMBER'S ENTITLEMENT 
TO SEPARATION PAY.  IF REQUIRED AND A SIGNED NAVY RESERVE AFFILIATION 
CONTRACT IS NOT COMPLETED PRIOR TO SAILOR SEPARATING, A PETITION TO 
THE BOARD OF CORRECTION FOR NAVAL RECORDS (BCNR) IS REQUIRED IN ORDER 
TO RECEIVE ISP.  INFORMATION ON PETITIONING BCNR CAN BE FOUND AT THE 
BCNR WEBSITE, HTTP://WWW.DONHQ.NAVY.MIL/BCNR/BCNR.HTM.

5.  UNDER CURRENT LEGISLATION, ISP WILL BE RECOUPED UPON RECEIVING A 
MILITARY RETIREMENT (INCLUDING A RESERVE RETIREMENT) OR DEPARTMENT OF 
VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA) DISABILITY COMPENSATION.  ADDITIONAL DETAILS AND 
INFORMATION ON BENEFITS, RESERVE AFFILIATION AND ISP CAN BE FOUND AT 
HTTP://WWW.PUBLIC.NAVY.MIL/BUPERS-NPC/CAREER/TRANSITION/PAGES/
ENLISTED.ASPX OR BY CALLING 1-866-U-ASK-NPC.
