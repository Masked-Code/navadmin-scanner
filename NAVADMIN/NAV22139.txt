DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND LESSONS LEARNED. 
 
RMKS/1.  Purpose.  To provide additional guidance regarding Navy service 
members who wish to withdraw a religious accommodation request in order to 
separate from naval service.  Also, to modify CCDA data reporting 
requirements. 
 
2.  Policy.  Navy service members who submitted a religious accommodation 
request regarding the requirement to be vaccinated against COVID-19 were 
certified by the U.S. District Court order in reference (a) as members of a 
class action in the case of U.S. Navy SEALS 1-26, et al., versus Secretary of 
Defense Lloyd J. Austin, III, et al.  This message supplements guidance 
previously provided in reference (b). To ensure compliance with the court 
order in reference (a), this NAVADMIN continues to suspend separation 
processing and certain adverse administrative consequences of COVID-19 
vaccine refusal for Navy service members who submitted requests for religious 
accommodation from the COVID-19 vaccine requirement. However, in accordance 
with the court order in reference (c), service members who wish to withdraw 
their religious accommodation requests may do so, understanding that unless 
they become vaccinated, they will be processed for involuntary administrative 
separation and all associated adverse administrative consequences will apply. 
 
3.  Applicability.  Policies in paragraph 4 of this NAVADMIN apply only to 
Navy service members who have submitted requests for religious accommodation 
from the COVID-19 vaccine requirement in line with references (d) and 
(e).  Adverse administrative consequences and separation processing described 
in references (f) through (o) continue to apply for Navy personnel refusing 
the COVID-19 vaccine who have not submitted a request for religious 
accommodation.  Navy service members who do not wish to withdraw a 
previously submitted religious accommodation request are not subject to 
adverse consequences as described in reference (b).  Policies in paragraph 5 
of this NAVADMIN apply to all Navy commands. 
 
4.  Action 
 
4.a.  Effective immediately, service members who wish to withdraw their 
previous religious accommodation requests seeking exemption from the COVID-19 
vaccine requirement may do so by executing the NAVPERS 1070/13 (Page 13) 
located at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-covid-19-reporting.  After 
executing this document reflecting understanding of the consequences of such 
a withdrawal, such service members will be considered I violation of 
reference (f) and may be subject to all adverse administrative measures 
associated with vaccine refusal described in references (g), (h), and (i), 
including processing for involuntary separation.  Religious accommodation 
requests or appeals may be withdrawn at any stage in the process, regardless 
of whether it is resolved or pending. 
 
4.b.  In cases where service members desire to withdraw their religious 
accommodation request, it is the responsibility of the service members 
command to execute the required Page 13 with the service member.  Once 
received, to continue processing for separation, commands must take two 
steps: 
 
4.b.(1) In order to track religious accommodation withdrawals, commands must 
forward copies of signed Page 13s via email to 
ALTN_Navy_Religious_Accommodations(at)navy.mil. 
 
4.b.(2) In order to effectuate separation, commands must: 
 
4.b.(2)(a) Include copies of the signed Page 13 in separation packages not 
yet routed to Navy Personnel Command in accordance with processes outlined 
for vaccine refusal described in reference (i). 
 
4.b.(2)(b) In the case of separation packages already routed to Navy 
Personnel Command IAW reference (i), but on hold due to the injunction, 
forward copies of the signed Page 13 to the relevant active/reserve 
officer/enlisted email address at PERS-8 below, who will resume involuntary 
separation processing based on vaccine refusal. 
 
4.b.(2)(c) In the case of separations previously approved by Navy Personnel 
Command, but on hold after release of earlier *10-day* letters, provide a 
copy of the relevant Page 13 to the servicing Personnel Support Detachment to 
effectuate local separation, copying the relevant PERS-8 office at the 
correct address below. 
 
4.c.  Substantive modifications or deletions to the Page 13 located 
at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-covid-19-reporting are not authorized. 
 
5.  Reporting.  Database reporting to the Department of the Navy (DON) COVID 
Tracking Site listed in reference (p) is no longer required.  Commanders are 
directed to provide updates based on categories listed in reference (p) to 
the following. 
 
5.a.  For service members who have submitted a religious 
accommodation request, provide updates to the 
ALTN_Navy_Religious_Accommodations(at)navy.mil email address. 
Commanders shall include the service members DoD ID number in the email. 
 
5.b.  For service members who have not submitted a religious accommodation 
request but have elected to become vaccinated, or now have access to the 
COVID-19 vaccine, provide updates to the altn_n1_navy_scr.fct(at)navy.mil 
email address.  Commanders shall include the service members DoD ID number in 
the email. 
 
5.c.  Commands will also ensure that the Medical Readiness Reporting System 
(MRRS) is updated to be consistent with information submitted to the DON 
COVID Tracking Site. 
 
6.  If in doubt as to how to adjudicate issues related to this guidance, 
commanders should seek guidance from their chain of command, their staff 
judge advocate, and/or the CCDA before acting. Commands without an assigned 
legal advisor may seek legal advice from a Region Legal Service Office.  In 
all cases, commanders are accountable to ensure the health and safety of 
their command while treating every Navy service member with dignity and 
respect.
