RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN replaces reference (a) and announces the policy and 
guidance for Calendar Year (CY) 2022 Season one Meritorious Advancement 
Program (MAP) for Active Duty (Active Component and Training and 
Administration of the Reserve (TAR)) Sailors.  MAP season one will run from 1 
March through 15 April 2022. 
 
2.  MAP will account for approximately 20 percent of total advancements 
during CY22, with roughly half of the available MAP quotas allocated for each 
of two MAP seasons during the year.  The two-season framework aligns MAP with 
the NWAE to ensure any unused MAP quotas are included in the NWAE cycle, and 
to emphasize the intent of MAP to select and reward top performing 
Sailors.  To meet required time-in-rate for MAP advancement eligibility, 
Sailors must have a date of rank no later than the following: 
    a.  E-5:  1 January 2021 
    b.  E-5 (Nuclear-Trained Sailors):  1 January 2020 
    c.  E-4 and below:  No TIR requirement 
 
3.  In order to control over-advancing particular rate-paygrade combinations 
and maintain rating health, MAP advancement to AO3 and RS3 for Active Duty 
Sailors will be controlled as outlined in paragraph 6. 
 
4.  In line with reference (b), MAP advancement to ABH2, ABF2, GSM2 and CS2 
for Active Component Sailors is not authorized due to new advancement 
opportunities available within the Detailing Marketplace Assignment Policy 
(DMAP) for those rates beginning 1 March 22. Visit MyNavy HRs DMAP website, 
located at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
Management/Detailing/Enlisted/Detailing-Marketplace/, for more information. 
 
5.  Commands are required to have two Navy Standard Integrated Personnel 
System (NSIPS) MAP user roles (command reviewer and command reporting senior) 
in order to submit MAP advancement(s), exception(s) to policy (ETP) and 
additional MAP quota requests through NSIPS.  NSIPS Web Afloat users and 
commands without access to NSIPS should refer to paragraph 5a for 
instructions on submitting their MAP advancements.  The system will use 
authoritative data to determine eligibility, however, commands are still 
required to locally validate that MAP candidates have successfully completed 
the professional military knowledge eligibility examination requirement 
prior to the first day of the MAP season (1 March 2022), as outlined 
in reference (c).  For training on user roles, log into NSIPS via 
https://www.nsips.navy.mil and click on training tab, then click MAP 
tutorial (JPA). 
    a.  NSIPS Web Afloat users and commands without access to NSIPS must 
submit a MAP nomination request via e-mail directly to their immediate 
superior in charge (ISIC), type commander (TYCOM) or budget submitting office 
(BSO)/echelon II command using the meritorious certification letter 
(MCL).  The letter must be signed by the commanding officer and should 
address any ETP and/or additional quotas requested.  Sample MCLs and detailed 
information regarding the offline process can be found via MyNavy Portal 
(MNP) at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/a-enlisted-
advancement-resources-and-links, then select the *Websites* 
tab in the blue banner, and then select the MAP homepage. 
    b.  Quota usage, modifications and distribution will be managed within 
the NSIPS environment.  BSO and command quotas will be uploaded into NSIPS on 
20 February 2022 and can be found under the quota summary report tab.  Quotas 
can also be found via MNP at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-
promotion/a-enlisted-advancement-resources-and-links, then select the 
*Websites* tab in the blue banner, and then select the MAP homepage. 
    c.  Additional quotas can be requested using the quota request option by 
the command reviewer user role.  Commands must contact their BSO to determine 
timeline for additional quota requests. Whether or not command quotas are 
authorized, all commands have the opportunity to request quotas from their 
BSO/echelon II command, via their ISIC and TYCOM, unless the rating is not 
authorized for MAP in line with paragraphs 3 above. 
    d.  NSIPS will automatically determine if an ETP is required using 
predetermined criteria.  Service Members in ratings requiring security 
clearances and rates/pay grades requiring time in rate TIR waivers will be 
automatically routed for adjudication.  The request will be routed through 
the ISIC, TYCOM, and BSO/echelon II command using a hierarchical workflow. 
    e.  NSIPS will not automatically generate an ETP for Nuclear-trained 
Service Members.  Commands desiring to advance a nuclear-trained Service 
Member not meeting the TIR requirement must request an ETP to Director, 
Military Personnel Plans and Policy (OPNAV N13) via the Nuclear Program 
Manager (OPNAV N133). 
 
6.  MAP Advancements in Controlled Rates.  Commands desiring to MAP a Sailor 
to AO3 or RS3 must submit a request to their BSO, via their ISIC and TYCOM, 
using the quota request option in NSIPS.  If the command does not have access 
to NSIPS, they should follow the procedures in paragraph 5a.  BSOs will be 
granted MAP quotas for each rate based on the proportion of the billets 
authorized (BA) at the lower paygrade of that rate under that BSO.  If there 
are not enough quotas for all BSOs with BA for the lower paygrade, the 
quotas will be allocated to the BSOs with the largest amount of BA for the 
lower paygrade.  BSOs will be contacted by BUPERS-32 to inform them of how 
many of their assigned quotas shall be used only for the specified 
rates.  Commands will submit requests to the BSOs using the template provided 
on the MAP homepage via MNP at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-
and-promotion/a-enlisted-advancement-resources-and-links, then select the 
*Websites* tab in the blue banner, and then select the MAP homepage. 
 
7.  MAP Website.  MAP quotas by unit identification code, forms and 
frequently asked questions can be found at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/a-enlisted-
advancement-resources-and-links, then select the *Websites* tab in the blue 
banner and then select the MAP homepage.  The list of points of contact for 
each BSO/echelon II command and list of parent and subordinate UICs can also 
be found on the above website.

9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
