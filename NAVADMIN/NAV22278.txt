RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces guidance regarding administration of the 
Spring 2023 Navy-wide Advancement Exam (NWAE) for Selected Reserve (SELRES) 
and Prior Service Reenlistment Eligibility Reserve (PRISE-R) Sailors (cycle 
112).  It also provides a permanent way forward regarding advancement to E-4. 
Cycle 112 includes those SELRES candidates serving on voluntary recall, 
mobilization or as Canvasser Recruiters. 
 
2.  Effective immediately, the requirement for SELRES E-4 candidates to take 
the NWAE to compete for advancement to E-4 is permanently eliminated. PRISE-R 
E-4 candidates will participate in one final NWAE this spring (cycle 112) and 
then transition in the fall.  The Navy learned many lessons from the COVID-19 
pandemic and use of Alternative Final Multiple Score (A-FMS) to determine E-4 
advancements has proven to be an effective metric of overall Sailor quality 
which places increased emphasis on performance.  Moving forward, we will 
continue to look at other methods of advancing Sailors to E-4 that do not 
involve an exam and support Marketplace-based advancement initiatives. 
 
3.  To facilitate PRISE-R transition away from E-4 advancement exams the 
following policy changes are in effect: 
    a.  Modifying reference (a), PRISE-R E-3 and E-4 Sailors will participate 
in the Spring NWAE process.  These will be the last E-4 exams administered 
specifically to make a PRISE-R Sailors rate permanent.  Further guidance will 
be published via an ALNAVRESFOR message. 
 
4.  In line with references (b) and (c), The Enlisted Advancement Worksheet 
(EAW) is the authoritative source of all data used to determine cycle 112 
advancements.  Any information not reflected in EAW will not be taken into 
account to determine advancement.  EAW discrepancies may be addressed via the 
post-advancement exam administration process. 
 
5.  Timeline: 
    a.  31 December 2022: Professional Military Knowledge - Eligibility Exam 
(PMK-EE) completion deadline.  In line with reference (d), PMK-EE remains 
mandatory for all Sailors to be eligible for exam participation or, in the 
case of SELRES E-4 candidates, to be advancement eligible.  Refer to 
references (e) and (f) regarding special exceptions for new accession E-3 and 
E-4 PMK-EE requirements. 
    b.  1-28 February 2023: Exam administration. 
    c.  28 February 2023: EAW completion due date for E-4 - E-7 candidates. 
 
6.  Cycle 112 specific eligibility requirements:

    d.  High-year tenure (HYT) dates for E-4 - E-6 is 1 July 23 and for E-7

dates or later.  HYT waivers must be approved prior to 1 February 2023. 
    e.  Candidates with a request for voluntary transfer to retired or Fleet 
reserve prior to mandated HYT are not eligible to advance. 
    f.  Security/Interim security clearance (if required):  Refer to chapter 
2 of reference (b).  All NWAE candidates must have applicable adjudication 
(Top Secret or Secret) or Interim clearance prior to 1 February 2023.  If 
clearance is revoked, an exam is not authorized until discrepancy corrected. 
    g.  Performance Mark average (PMA).  Compute PMA for all candidates and 
in addition, Reporting Senior*s Cumulative Average (RSCA) PMA for E-6 - E-7 
candidates in line with references (b) and (g).  Use all evaluations in 
current paygrade with an ending date that falls within following periods: 
        (1) E-4 - 1 June 22 to 31 January 23 
        (2) E-5 - 1 February 22 to 31 January 23
