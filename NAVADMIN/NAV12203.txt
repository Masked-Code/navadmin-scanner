SUBJ/NAVY FAMILY HOUSING ADVOCACY ROLE//

RMKS/1. THE NAVY HOUSING PROGRAM SERVES AS BOTH AN ADVOCATE FOR SAILORS AND 
FAMILIES AS WELL AS PROVIDING PROGRAM OVERSIGHT OF MAINTENANCE PRACTICES AND 
HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES AS RELATED TO HOUSING. THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES 
INITIATIVES AND PROVIDES UPDATES FOR NAVY FAMILIES.

2. ENSURING SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE SUITABLE, AFFORDABLE AND 
SAFE HOUSING IS A PRIORITY FOR THE U.S. NAVY.
RECENT EVENTS IN NAVY FAMILY PRIVATIZED HOUSING HAVE INDICATED A NEED TO MORE 
CLEARLY COMMUNICATE ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE ON ALL ISSUES, BUT PARTICULARLY WHEN 
PERTAINING TO HEALTH OR SAFETY ISSUES. RESIDENT AWARENESS OF SERVICES PROVIDED 
BY THE HOUSING SERVICE CENTER (HSC) IS ESSENTIAL TO SUCCESSFUL ISSUE 
RESOLUTION.
THE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP PROVIDED SEPCOR TO ALL REGIONAL HOUSING 
DIRECTORS) AND GUIDANCE PROVIDED HEREIN ARE APPLICABLE TO ALL HOUSING; TO 
INCLUDE GOVERNMENT OWNED, PRIVATE SECTOR RENTALS, LEASED, AND PUBLIC PRIVATE 
VENTURE (PPV).

3. SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE MANY RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM IF THEY 
ENCOUNTER ISSUES WITH HOUSING THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO SATISFACTORILY RESOLVE 
WITH EITHER THE PPV OR CIVILIAN LANDLORD. THE CHAIN OF COMMAND IS ALWAYS 
AVAILABLE, AND SAILORS SHOULD SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM THE LEADING CHIEF, CMC, XO 
AND CO WHEN APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION:
A. SAILORS AND FAMILIES CAN GET ASSISTANCE FROM OUR HOUSING SUPPORT CENTERS. A 
NAVY HOUSING "LINK" HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE HOME PAGE OF THE CNIC PUBLIC WEBSITE 
FOR HQ, REGIONS, AND INSTALLATIONS.
THIS LINK PROVIDES CONTACT INFORMATION FOR NAVY HOUSING SUPPORT CENTERS. THERE 
ARE DEDICATED STAFF AT ALL HOUSING SUPPORT CENTERS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT, TENANT-

DAILY POSTINGS ON OFFICIAL MEDIA PAGES.
D. SAILORS AND FAMILIES CAN ALSO OBTAIN INFORMATION VIA OFFICIAL NON-HOUSING 
SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS WHERE CUSTOMERS PARTICIPATE, I.E., MCPON FACEBOOK PAGE,

SITES IN ORDER TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF SUPPORT SERVICES OFFERED BY HOUSING 
SUPPORT CENTERS.

DAYS OF MOVING INTO A PRIVATIZED HOUSING RESIDENCE. NAVY HOUSING STAFFS WILL

PARTNER OR TO NAVY HOUSING. BOTH OF THESE OVERSIGHT ACTIONS WILL INCREASE THE 
RESIDENT'S OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE DIRECT FEEDBACK TO NAVY HOUSING.
