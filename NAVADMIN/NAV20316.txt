live-fire qualification and sustainment criteria, and Navy Security Force 
sustainment training, as applicable, to the extent possible within COVID-19

directed to continue providing firearms safety and weapons familiarization, 
to include use of simulators for sustainment if available, within COVID-19

    b. In accordance with reference (c), for deployed afloat commands, 
qualification/sustainment may be extended until two months after return to

    c.  Per reference (h), extensions for live-fire small arms qualifications 
will not exceed a period of 24-months since the last live-fire qualification.  
Personnel who do not complete live-fire small arms qualifications within a
