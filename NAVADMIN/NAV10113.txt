SUBJ/CRIME REDUCTION PROGRAM INTRODUCES THE THREAT MANAGEMENT CAMPAIGN//

RMKS/1. THE CRIME REDUCTION PROGRAM (CRP) IS A COMMUNITY OUTREACH INITIATIVE 
DESIGNED TO REDUCE CRIMINAL THREATS AFFECTING THE DEPARTMENT OF NAVY (DON). IT 
IS LED BY THE NAVAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE SERVICE (NCIS) AND INCLUDES BOTH 
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY SERVICE PARTNERS WITHIN THE DON. EACH QUARTER 
THE CRP IDENTIFIES A RELEVANT ISSUE TO HIGHLIGHT THROUGH A ROBUST BRIEFING 
PROGRAM AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH EVENTS. BEGINNING 1 APRIL 2010 THROUGH 30 JUNE 
2010, THE CRP WILL FOCUS ITS EFFORTS ON THREAT MANAGEMENT, SPECIFICALLY 
WORKPLACE VIOLENCE AND STALKING.

2. FOLLOWING THE TRAGEDY AT FT. HOOD, TEXAS ON 5 NOVEMBER 2009, THE DEPARTMENT 
OF DEFENSE ESTABLISHED A REVIEW BOARD TO STUDY VIOLENCE IN THE WORKPLACE. 
WHILE THIS REVIEW IS ONGOING, IT IS CLEAR THAT DEFICIENCIES EXIST IN OUR 
ABILITY TO IDENTIFY INTERNAL THREATS.  WORKPLACE VIOLENCE CAN TAKE MANY FORMS, 
FROM INTIMIDATION OR HARRASSMENT TO STALKING OR ASSAULT, AND EVEN POSSIBLY, 
HOMICIDE.

3. WORKPLACE VIOLENCE RARELY OCCURS WITHOUT WARNING SIGNS AND INDICATORS. TOO 
OFTEN, THESE SIGNS GO UNNOTICED, UNACKNOWLEDGED, AND UNREPORTED. THE GOAL OF 
THIS CAMPAIGN IS TO CREATE A HEIGHTENED AWARENESS WITHIN THE DON COMMUNITY OF 
THE WARNING SIGNS, VIOLENCE INDICATORS, AND PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR ASSOCIATED 
WITH WORKPLACE VIOLENCE, IN ORDER TO PREVENT IT. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE ALL 
LEARN TO IDENTIFY THE SIGNS THAT COULD LEAD UP TO AN OUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE.

4. NCIS HAS A THREAT MANAGEMENT UNIT (TMU) DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EXPERTISE IN 
THE IDENTIFICATION OF RISK FACTORS, PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR, AND ESCALATION OF 
VIOLENCE. THROUGHOUT THIS THREE-MONTH CAMPAIGN, NCIS TMU REPRESENTATIVES WILL 
VISIT A VARIETY OF COMMANDS TO PROVIDE BRIEFINGS ON UNDERSTANDING AND 
IDENTIFYING THE DANGERS OF WORKPLACE VIOLENCE. BY HIGHLIGHTING THESE INTERNAL 
THREATS, NCIS, NAVY COMMANDS AND ALL NAVY PERSONNEL CAN WORK TOGETHER TO 
ELIMINATE THEM.
