NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 161/07, EDUCATION PRIORITIES AND MANAGEMENT OF OFF-
DUTY VOLUNTARY 
EDUCATION.  REF B IS CNETC LTR 1560/SERN00/178 OF 15 AUGUST 2007 PROMULGATING 
EXECUTION 
GUIDELINES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF OFF-DUTY VOLUNTARY EDUCATION 
PROGRAMS.  REF C IS OPNAVINST 
1560.9 VOLUNTARY EDUCATION FOR NAVY PERSONNEL.// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN RESCINDS THE RESTRICTION THAT DISALLOWED USE OF 
TUITION ASSISTANCE 
(TA) AND NCPACE FOR ENLISTED SAILORS WITH LESS THAN ONE YEAR OF SERVICE 
REMAINING.  
RESTRICTIONS BASED ON ENLISTED TIME IN SERVICE ARE ALSO RESCINDED.  THIS 
IMPLEMENTS A 
CHANGE TO THE POLICY AND GUIDELINES PROMULGATED IN REFERENCES A AND B AND 
ANNOUNCES THE 
COMING RELEASE OF OPNAVINST 1560.9A, VOLUNTARY EDUCATION FOR NAVY 
PERSONNEL. 
2.  TA MANAGEMENT CONTROLS ANNOUNCED BY REFERENCE A, AND CLARIFIED BY 
REFERENCE B, WILL 
REMAIN IN EFFECT THROUGHOUT FY08 WITH THE FOLLOWING 
EXCEPTION:  RESTRICTIONS ON ENLISTED 
SAILOR PARTICIPATION IN TUITION ASSISTANCE AND NCPACE BASED ON TIME-IN-
SERVICE AND EAOS ARE 
RESCINDED.  ENLISTED SAILORS MEETING ALL OTHER REQUIREMENTS MAY 
PARTICIPATE IN TUITION 
ASSISTANCE OR NCPACE AS LONG AS COURSE COMPLETION OCCURS PRIOR TO 
SEPARATION FROM ACTIVE 
DUTY.  SAILORS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO TAKE COURSES CONSISTENT WITH AN 
APPROVED EDUCATION PLAN 
AND COMPLETE COURSES WHILE ON ACTIVE DUTY. 
3.  AS THE NAVY CONTINUES TO BUILD AND SHAPE EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO MEET THE 
CHANGING NEEDS OF 
THE NAVY AND OUR SAILORS, A RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN 
OUR PLANNING 
PROCESS.  EQUALLY IMPORTANT, IS THE NEED TO SET GOALS, CONDUCT EARLY CAREER 
PLANNING AND 
MAINTAIN THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN JOB AND EDUCATION.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
SAILORS WITH FOUR-YEAR 
COMMITMENTS MAY FIND COMPLETING DEGREE REQUIREMENTS 
CHALLENGING.  COMPLETION OF ?A? SCHOOL 
AND SATISFACTORY PROGRESS TOWARD WARFARE QUALIFICATIONS MUST COME 
FIRST.  THIS DOES NOT 
PREVENT SAILORS FROM DEVELOPING AN EDUCATION PLAN AND STUDYING FOR CLEP 
AND DANTES EXAMS.  
WITH CAREFUL PLANNING, THESE SAILORS MAY COMPLETE 24-30 HOURS OF COLLEGE 
COURSES PRIOR TO 
COMPLETION OF THEIR FOUR-YEAR COMMITMENT.  THIS, COMBINED WITH CREDIT FOR 
MILITARY TRAINING 
AND EXPERIENCE, IN MANY CASES WILL LEAD TO A DEGREE. 
4.  FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF NAVY?S MANAGEMENT CONTROLS REQUIRES CLOSE 
COOPERATION AMONG THE 
NAVY COLLEGE OFFICES, COMMAND LEADERSHIP AND SAILORS.  ROLES AND 
RESPONSIBILITIES ARE 
OUTLINED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS.  
5.  NAVY COLLEGE OFFICES SHALL VALIDATE THE FOLLOWING ACADEMIC 
REQUIREMENTS FOR SAILORS 
REQUESTING USE OF TA OR NCPACE.  
    A.  ENSURE SAILORS HAVE AN EDUCATION PLAN, APPROVED BY THE ACADEMIC 
INSTITUTION BEFORE 
TA/NCPACE IS AUTHORIZED FOR MORE THAN FIVE COURSES. 
    B.  AUTHORIZE FUNDING FOR ONLY THOSE COURSES IDENTIFIED IN THE EDUCATION 
PLAN, INCLUDING 
PREREQUISITE COURSES. 
    C.  APPROVE ONLY COURSES WITH ACADEMIC CREDIT FROM EITHER A REGIONALLY 
OR NATIONALLY 
ACCREDITED INSTITUTION. 
    D.  DISAPPROVE REQUESTS FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION UNITS (CEUS). 
    E.  ENSURE FUNDING IS NOT AUTHORIZED FOR DEGREES EARNED AT THE SAME OR 
LOWER EDUCATION 
LEVEL.  EXCEPTIONS MAY BE GRANTED FOR SAILORS WHO CHANGE DESIGNATORS OR 
RATINGS PROVIDED THE 
ADDITIONAL DEGREE IS REQUIRED TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE FOR PROMOTION. 
6.  COMMANDING OFFICERS AND OFFICERS-IN-CHARGE WILL ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH 
PROFESSIONAL AND 
CAREER DEVELOPMENT POLICIES.  BEFORE RECOMMENDING APPROVAL OF REQUESTS 
FOR TA/NCPACE, 
COMMANDING OFFICERS AND OFFICERS-IN-CHARGE WILL ENSURE: 
    A.  ADVANCEMENT ELIGIBLE SAILORS HAVE TAKEN AND PASSED THE ADVANCEMENT 
EXAM DURING THE 
MOST RECENT COMPLETED EXAM CYCLE.  WAIVERS MAY BE AUTHORIZED FOR SAILORS 
WHO ARE UNABLE TO 
TAKE THE EXAM FOR LEGITIMATE CAUSES, SUCH AS WORKING OUTSIDE THEIR RATING, 
OPERATIONAL 
COMMITMENTS OR OTHER COMMAND-SANCTIONED REASONS.  WAIVERS ARE NOT 
ALLOWED FOR SAILORS WHO 
TAKE AND DO NOT PASS THE EXAM. 
    B.  SAILORS PASS THE MOST RECENT PHYSICAL FITNESS ASSESSMENT (PFA) OR BE 
MEDICALLY 
WAIVED.  
    C.  SAILORS ARE SATISFACTORILY PROGRESSING TOWARD COMPLETION OF OR HAVE 
COMPLETED 
REQUIRED WARFARE/PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS PRIOR TO APPROVING OR 
DISAPPROVING REQUESTS 
FOR TA/NCPACE.  SAILORS SHOULD DEMONSTRATE SATISFACTORY PROGRESS TOWARD 
TIMELY COMPLETION 
OF WARFARE/PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS AND THE ABILITY TO ASSUME THE 
ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES 
OF AN ACADEMIC PROGRAM. 
7.  SAILORS ARE REQUIRED TO ASSESS CAREER AND EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND WORK 
WITH BOTH NAVY 
LEADERSHIP AND NAVY COLLEGE OFFICES TO DEVELOP A PLAN THAT PLACES A 
PRIORITY ON WARFARE/ 
PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS AND SUPPORTS CAREER DEVELOPMENT.  THE 
EDUCATION PLAN IS ONLY 
ONE ASPECT OF A SAILOR?S CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN.  SAILORS WILL: 
    A.  ENSURE EDUCATION AND TRAINING DATA ARE RECORDED AND KEPT CURRENT IN 
THEIR SMART 
TRANSCRIPT. 
    B.  MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE COURSES. 
8.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR NEW TA POLICIES AND THEIR IMPACT ON OUR 
SAILORS PERSONAL 
AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.  IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE COLLECTION OF 
DATA FOR FURTHER 
ANALYSIS, THE FOLLOWING EMAIL LINK IS AVAILABLE FOR SAILORS TO PROVIDE 
FEEDBACK ON VOLED 
POLICIES, SPECIFICALLY WHAT WORKS AND WHAT IS AN OBSTACLE OR 
CHALLENGE.  THE EMAIL IS
