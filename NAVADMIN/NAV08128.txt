RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN, THE FIFTH IN A SERIES, ON THE JOINT 
QUALIFICATION SYSTEM (JQS), PROVIDES LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE FEBRUARY 
JOINT QUALIFICATION SYSTEM REVIEW PANEL CONDUCTED BY THE JOINT STAFF 
AND PROMULGATES THE DATES FOR THE REMAINING CALENDAR YEAR (CY) 08 JQS 
REVIEW PANELS.
2.  AS OUTLINED IN REFS A THROUGH D, THE JQS REPLACES THE PREVIOUS 
DESIGNATION OF JOINT SPECIALTY OFFICER (JSO) WITH THE NEW DESIGNATION 
JOINT QUALIFIED OFFICER (JQO).  THE RESULTS OF THE FEBRUARY REVIEW 
PANEL AND ADDITIONAL JQS INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND ON-LINE AT 
WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/OFFICER/JOINTOFFICER. 
3.  THE JQS SELF-NOMINATION WEBSITE, HOSTED BY THE DEFENSE MANPOWER 
DATA CENTER (DMDC) AND LOCATED ON-LINE AT HTTPS://WWW.DMDC.OSD.MIL/JQS/, 
HAS BEEN ACCEPTING SUBMISSIONS SINCE 1 OCT 07.  OFFICERS MAY SELF-
NOMINATE THEIR JOINT EXPERIENCES ON THE WEBSITE FOR CONSIDERATION BY 
THE REVIEW PANEL TO AWARD POINT CREDIT.  THE WEBSITE PROVIDES 
DIRECTIONS FOR SELF-NOMINATION, AS WELL AS HOW TO SEND HARD COPY DATA 
SUPPORTING THE REQUESTS FOR JOINT CREDIT.  OFFICERS MUST HAVE COMPLETED 
THE EXPERIENCE TOUR FOR WHICH THEY ARE SELF-NOMINATING.  THE WEBSITE 
SHOULD NOT BE USED TO SELF-NOMINATE FOR JPME COMPLETION.  GUIDANCE FOR 
SUBMISSION OF REQUESTS FOR POINTS FOR OTHER JOINT EDUCATION, TRAINING 
AND JOINT EXERCISES WILL BE PROMULGATED AT A LATER DATE.
4.  THE PRIMARY DOCUMENT REVIEWED BY THE JQS PANEL TO MAKE A 
DETERMINATION IF THE EXPERIENCE MEETS THE DEFINITION OF JOINT MATTERS 
IS THE INDIVIDUAL JOINT EXPERIENCE SUMMARY (IJES), WHICH MAY BE FOUND 
ON THE NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (NPC) WEBSITE.  OFFICERS SHOULD INCLUDE 
AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE WHEN FILLING OUT THE IJES AND SHOULD BE 
SPECIFIC IN EXPLAINING THE RELATIONSHIP OF THEIR TASKS AND 
RESPONSIBILITIES IN ACHIEVING THE DEFINITION OF JOINT MATTERS.  IF THE 
OFFICER SERVED IN AN OWN-SERVICE POSITION, THERE MUST BE A CLEAR AND 
COMPELLING INDICATION THAT HE OR SHE WAS REGULARLY INVOLVED IN DUTIES 
MEETING THE DEFINITION OF JOINT MATTERS.  
TO ENSURE CLARITY, OFFICERS SHOULD LIMIT THE USE OF ABBREVIATIONS OR 
ACRONYMS.
5.  OFFICERS SHOULD FORWARD SUFFICIENT SUPPORTING MATERIAL TO ENABLE 
JQS PANELS TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE JOINT NATURE OF THE EXPERIENCE AND 
THE FORCE TO WHICH ASSIGNED.  FOR EXAMPLE, AN OFFICER ON AN INDIVIDUAL 
AUGMENTATION ASSIGNMENT MAY INCLUDE A LETTER FROM HIS OR HER (JOINT, 
COALITION, OTHER SERVICE, INTERAGENCY, AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL) REPORTING 
SENIOR DETAILING THE JOINT NATURE OF THE ASSIGNMENT, ALONG WITH FITNESS 
REPORTS AND AWARD CITATIONS AS APPROPRIATE.  SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION 
MUST CLEARLY INDICATE THE START AND END DATE OF THE ASSIGNMENT.
    A.  PERFORMANCE REPORTS/EVALUATIONS AND AWARDS SHOULD SHOW HOW THE 
OFFICER'S DUTIES RELATED TO THE DEFINITION OF JOINT MATTERS.
    B.  OFFICERS IN THE RESERVE COMPONENT SHOULD EXPLAIN WHETHER THEIR 
EXPERIENCES WERE GAINED DURING AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF ACTIVE DUTY (I.E., 
INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION OR ACTIVE DUTY FOR SPECIAL WORK), OR AS PART OF 
NORMAL RESERVE UNIT DUTIES.
    C.  OFFICERS SHOULD CLEARLY EXPLAIN ANY UNIT OR POSITIONAL DUAL-HAT 
ARRANGEMENTS OR RELATIONSHIPS IN SUPPORT OF THEIR JOINT EXPERIENCE, 
SUCH AS DUTY IN OWN-SERVICE MILITARY UNITS THAT ALSO HAD NATO OR 
STANDING JOINT TASK FORCE HEADQUARTERS DUAL-HATTED FUNCTIONS.
    D.  OFFICERS MUST ALSO CAREFULLY SPECIFY IF THEY WERE SERVING IN 
POSITIONS THEY BELIEVED HAD A HIGHER THAN STEADY-STATE INTENSITY FACTOR, 
(E.G., TWO OR THREE), WHEN THE HIGHER INTENSITY PERIOD BEGAN AND ENDED, 
AND THE UNIT THEY WERE ASSIGNED TO AT THE TIME.  OFFICERS SHOULD 
PROVIDE JUSTIFYING DOCUMENTS, SUCH AS LEAVE AND EARNINGS STATEMENT 
INFORMATION, SHOWING RECEIPT OF HOSTILE FIRE PAY OR IMMINENT DANGER PAY 
TO SUPPORT REQUESTED PERIODS FOR INTENSITY FACTOR THREE.
    E.  PRE AND POST DEPLOYMENT TRAINING TIME IS GENERALLY NOT VIEWED 
AS MEETING THE DEFINITION OF JOINT MATTERS AND SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED 
UNLESS THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE THE OFFICER WAS ENGAGED IN JOINT 
MATTERS DURING PREPARATION.  IF INCLUDED, THE PRE AND POST DEPLOYMENT 
TRAINING TIME SHOULD BE SUBMITTED SEPARATELY FROM THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE 
TO FACILITATE THE PROPER APPLICATION OF INTENSITY FACTORS.
6.  THE STATUTORY DEFINITION OF JOINT MATTERS USED BY THE REVIEW PANEL 
TO ASSESS EXPERIENCES MAY BE FOUND IN REF E AND IS ALSO POSTED IN THE 
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS SECTION OF THE NPC WEBSITE ABOVE.  THE DATES 
OF FUTURE JQS REVIEW PANELS FOR CY08 ARE
17-18 JUN, 8-9 SEP, AND 18-19 NOV.  OFFICERS SHOULD CHECK THE NPC 
WEBSITE REGULARLY FOR POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THESE DATES AND CUTOFF DATES 
FOR SUBMISSIONS. 
7.  BOTH ACTIVE AND RESERVE OFFICERS MAY SUBMIT PACKAGES FOR EXPERIENCE 
TOURS RETROACTIVE TO 11 SEP 01.  ADDITIONALLY, RESERVE OFFICERS MAY 
SUBMIT PACKAGES FOR EXPERIENCE TOURS IN A JOINT DUTY ASSIGNMENT LIST 
(JDAL) TYPE BILLET (I.E., OFFICE OF SECRETARY OF DEFENSES, JOINT STAFF, 
AND COMBATANT COMMAND HEADQUARTERS) RETROACTIVE TO 1 OCT 86.  CONTACT 
NPC (PERS-45J) FOR QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO ELIGIBLE EXPERIENCES PRIOR
