BOOST (IF APPLICABLE), AND UNIVERSITY START DATE.
    D.  SEND AN OFFICIAL DEGREE PLAN FROM AN NROTC HOST OR NROTC
CROSS-TOWN AFFILIATED UNIVERSITY WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED.

IF A PRIMARY SELECTEE DECLINES PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM, IS
DETERMINED NOT TO BE PHYSICALLY QUALIFIED OR OTHERWISE BECOMES
INELIGIBLE FOR CONTINUATION IN THE PROGRAM PRIOR TO EXECUTING
ORDERS, A QUALIFIED ALTERNATE WILL BE SELECTED.  THIS NOTIFICATION
OFTEN COMES AT THE LAST MINUTE AND THEREFORE ALTERNATES NEED TO BE
PREPARED WHEN THAT TIME COMES.

8.  THE DEADLINE FOR REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION OUTLINED IN PARAGRAPH
4C AND 4D WILL BE PROVIDED VIA SEPCOR.  HOWEVER, IT IS IN THE BEST
INTEREST OF EACH SELECTEE AND ALTERNATE TO SEND IN VERIFICATION OF
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO EXPEDITE UNIVERSITY

NROTC UNIVERSITY UNTIL ALL CONDITIONS OUTLINED IN PARAGRAPH 4A
THROUGH 4D HAVE BEEN MET.  THOSE ASSIGNED TO 6-MONTH BOOST ARE
ELIGIBLE FOR PCS ORDERS AFTER THE CONDITIONS OUTLINED IN PARAGRAPH
4A AND 4B HAVE BEEN MET.  HOWEVER, THOSE ASSIGNED TO 6-MONTH BOOST
SHOULD MEET CONDITIONS OF PARAGRAPH 4C AND 4D AS QUICKLY AS
POSSIBLE TO INCREASE CHANCES OF BEING ASSIGNED TO THEIR FIRST
CHOICE UNIVERSITY.
