RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Navy 
Active and Reserve Component Enlisted Advancement Selection Boards for Chief 
Petty Officer.  The Active Component and Training and Administration of the 
Reserves (TAR) cycle is 254 and the Selected Reserve (SELRES) cycle is 
110.  For board purposes, the Reserve Component (RC) board will consider TAR 
(cycle 254), SELRES and those serving on voluntary and involuntary recall and 
mobilization orders (cycle 110).  Mobilized individual ready reserve and 
canvasser recruiter personnel are considered under the SELRES requirements 
for advancement.  This is a change from policy in reference (a). 
 
2.  RC Timeline 
    a.  28 February 2022:  Individual augmentation evaluations used for  
time-in-rate (TIR) waivers must have an ending date by this date and must be 
available to the board. 
    b.  6 May 2022:  RC candidates changing ratings must be in their new 
rating by this date to be considered for selection in the new rating. 
    c.  23 May 2022:  Letter to the board (LTB) deadline for the RC E-7 
selection board. 
    d.  6 June 2022:  RC E-7 selection board convenes.  All eligibility 
requirements, to include any waivers, must have final approval and be posted 
to the records of the candidates prior to this date. 
    e.  24 June 2022:  RC E-7 selection board scheduled to adjourn. 
 
3.  AC Timeline 
    a.  28 February 2022:  Individual augmentation evaluations used for TIR 
waivers must have an ending date by this date and must be available to the 
board. 
    b.  5 June 2022:  AC candidates changing ratings must be in their new 
rating by this date to be considered for selection in the new rating. 
    c.  20 June 2022:  LTB deadline to the AC E-7 selection board. 
    d.  5 July 2022:  AC E-7 selection board convenes.  All eligibility 
requirements, to include any waivers, must have final approval and be posted 
to the records of the candidates prior to this date. 
    e.  29 July 2022:  AC E-7 selection board scheduled to adjourn. 
 
4.  Eligibility Criteria.  Candidates must meet the eligibility requirements 
outlined in chapters 2 and 11 of reference (a) and this NAVADMIN prior to the 
scheduled board convening date.  All requirements must be reflected in the 
enlisted master file (EMF) for AC and TAR or inactive manpower and personnel 
management information system for SELRES, those serving on voluntary and 
involuntary recall and mobilization orders, mobilized individual ready 
reserve and canvasser recruiter personnel prior to the board convening. 
Requirements achieved or posted to the record of the candidates after the 
scheduled board convening date will be considered late and will not make a 
candidate eligible for the regularly scheduled board or entitle a candidate 
to a special selection board.  If candidates are deemed ineligible for 
advancement and invalidated in Navy enlisted advancement system (NEAS) but 
later regain eligibility, submit a message-formatted e-mail to Naval 
Education and Training Professional Development Center (NETPDC) (N321) and 
Selection Board Eligibility Branch (PERS-802) requesting validation of 
eligibility status and provide an explanation.  Eligibility requirements 
include: 
    a.  The name of the candidate appearing on the selection board 
eligibility list in the correct competitive group on their profile 
sheet.  Candidates should register for e-mail notification for profile sheet 
updates via MyNavy Portal (MNP) 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/my- 
advancement.  Select *My Profiles* then *Advancement Profile Sheet-
Individuals.*  Candidates and commands share equal responsibility to ensure 
the eligibility list is accurate.  Because eligibility status can change 
without direct notification, candidates should verify their profile sheet on 
a continuous basis.  Commands must verify their examination status 
verification reports (ESVR) weekly through the projected board adjourn date 
at the NEAS website via MNP 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/command- 
information.  Select *Command Advancement Tools* then *Advancement Profile 
Sheet-ESO.* 
    b.  TIR date must be on or before 1 January 2020.  In line with 
reference (a), the terminal eligibility date used to compute TIR is 1 January 
2023.  If an early promote (EP) TIR waiver is granted, the evaluation used to 
grant the EP TIR waiver must be available to the board. 
    c.  High year tenure (HYT) waivers must be approved prior to the board 
convening.  In order to be eligible for board consideration, an eligible 
candidate must have a HYT date in current paygrade of 1 September 2022 or 
later.  Candidates who reach HYT before 1 September 2022 for the next higher 
paygrade are ineligible for advancement, regardless of any approved HYT 
waiver.  Service Members with an approved HYT date in September 2022 may 
apply for an additional waiver of their current HYT gate due to the current 
board results scheduling and terminal leave constraints.  HYT waivers will 
be considered for up to an additional 2 months after 1 September 
2022.  Requests will be approved on a case-by-case basis.  Sailors will 
submit a command endorsed Navy Personnel 1306/7 enlisted personnel action 
request (NAVPERS 1306/7) to My Navy Career Center (MNCC) via MyNavy Portal or 
by emailing the ePAR request directly to askmncc(at)navy.mil.  Requests must 
be approved by 1 June 2022. 
    d.  Sailors with a previously approved retirement are automatically 
removed from board consideration (invalidated), unless the command completes 
a revalidation of the Sailors retirement prior to selection board convening 
date by sending an e-mail with a reason for revalidation to PERS-802 to 
ensure they are considered by the board.  See paragraph 208 of reference (a) 
for fleet reserve request impacts to eligibility. 
    e.  Security clearance requirements.  See paragraph 203 of reference 
(a).  Ratings requiring a security clearance are AC, AE, AG, AO, AT, AWF, 
AWO, AWR, AWS, AWV, AZ, CTI, CTM, CTN, CTR, CTT, EOD, ET, FC, FCA, GM, HT, 
IC, IS, IT, LN, MA, MC, MN, ND, OS, QM, SB, SO, STG and YN, as well as all 
nuclear and submarine ratings. 
    f.  Rating specific and competitive group eligibility 
requirements.  Candidates must meet special requirements for certain ratings, 
as outlined in paragraphs 203 and 206 of reference (a). 
Required Navy enlisted classifications (NEC) must be posted in the enlisted 
master file (EMF) for AC and TAR or inactive manpower and personnel 
management information system (IMAPMIS) for SELRES, those serving on 
voluntary and involuntary recall and mobilization orders, mobilized 
individual ready reserve and canvasser recruiter personnel prior to the 
regularly scheduled board convening date.  NECs posted to the EMF or IMAPMIS 
after the regularly scheduled board convening date, even with a prior date, 
will not entitle a candidate to a special selection board.  Commands must 
verify and submit a message-formatted e-mail to NETPDC (N321) and PERS-802 
requesting invalidation of those selection board eligible candidates who no 
longer meet rate specific and competitive group qualifications listed in 
reference (a) or below by the scheduled board convening date. 
        (1) Nuclear trained Sailors must hold additional NEC N33Z to indicate 
engineering watch supervisor or propulsion plant watch supervisor 
qualification in line with reference (b). 
        (2) In line with reference (c), non-nuclear trained submarine Sailors 
must be designated as either qualified in submarines (SS), in training for 
submarine qualifications (SU), or qualified for submarines but not planned 
for future assignment to submarine duty (SQ) as of the board convening date 
to be eligible. Candidates designated as qualified for submarines but not in 
a submarine source rating or NEC or previously assigned in submarines but 
disqualified for submarine duty and serving in a submarine support billet 
(SP) are not eligible for advancement. 
 
5.  Record review and communication with the E-7 selection board refer to 
reference (d). 
    a.  Communication to the board must originate from the individual 
candidate and must be accompanied under the signed LTB of the candidate. 
    b.  All LTBs and each enclosure must contain the candidates full name and 
10-digit DoD identification number.  Candidates must verify the correct board 
number is on their signed cover letter.  Board numbers are: 
        (1) Board # 335 for SELRES. 
        (2) Board # 336 for TAR. 
        (3) Board # 360 for AC. 
    c.  Electronic submission of selection board documents (ESSBD) is the 
preferred method to submit a LTB as directed by reference (d).  Candidates

navigating to the Advancement and Promotion webpage, select the *ESSBD* tile 
link. 
    d.  If unable to submit a LTB package using ESSBD (e.g. low bandwidth,
