AMPN/REF A IS NAVADMIN 014/09, RATING ENTRY FOR GENERAL APPRENTICES 
(REGA).// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES IMPROVED RATING DESIGNATION FOR TOP
PERFORMING SAILORS.  AS ANNOUNCED IN REF A, THE NAVY WILL IMPLEMENT 
A RATING/YEAR GROUP BASED QUOTA SYSTEM EFFECTIVE 1 JULY 2009.  THIS 
WILL VECTOR OUR TOP PERFORMING NON-DESIGNATED SAILORS TO UNDERMANNED 
RATINGS, PUTTING THEM ON A CAREER TRACK THAT BALANCES NAVY REQUIREMENTS 
AND SAILOR CHOICE.  ADDITIONALLY, THE NEW PROCESS IMPROVES SAILOR FIT, 
REDUCES PAPERWORK, AND SUPPORTS OUR COMMITMENT TO PLACE PROFESSIONAL 
APPRENTICE CAREER TRACK (PACT) AND GENERAL DETAIL (GENDET) SAILORS INTO 
RATINGS WITHIN 24 MONTHS OF REPORTING TO THEIR FIRST PERMANENT DUTY 
STATION.
2.  COMMAND CAREER COUNSELORS WILL USE THE FLEET RATING IDENTIFICATION 
ENGINE (FLEET RIDE) TO DETERMINE SAILOR ELIGIBILITY AND AVAILABLE 
QUOTAS FOR THEIR DESIRED RATING PRIOR TO SUBMITTING THE REQUEST 
DIRECTLY TO BUPERS.  ENLISTED COMMUNITY MANAGERS (ECM) WILL DEVELOP 
QUOTAS, REVIEW RACK AND STACK RESULTS, AND APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE 
APPLICATIONS.  MONTHLY QUOTAS AND APPLICATION RESULTS WILL BE AVAILABLE 
IN FLEET RIDE AND AT WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/CAREERINFO/ 
ENLISTEDCAREERPROGRESSION/ACTIVEDUTYADVANCEMENT.  
3.  APPROVALS FOR RATING DESIGNATION WILL BE DETERMINED BY UNIT 
BILLET BASE, ONBOARD MANNING STATUS, AND SAILOR ELIGIBILITY.  VIA 
FLEET RIDE, COMMANDS MAY SUBMIT UP TO THREE CHOICES PER APPLICANT 
FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING DESIGNATION PATHS:
    A.  NAVY WIDE ADVANCEMENT EXAM (NWAE) APPLICATIONS.  SAILORS 
MUST MEET ALL CURRENT RATING ENTRY REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING TIME IN 
RATE ELIGIBILITY AND ADVANCEMENT RECOMMENDATION FOR NWAE "APPROVAL 
REQUIRED" RATINGS.
    B.  "A" SCHOOL APPLICATIONS.  SAILORS MUST HAVE MINIMUM 12 MONTHS 
ONBOARD PRIOR TO SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION AND MEET ALL CURRENT RATING 
ENTRY AND "A" SCHOOL ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS.  ADDITIONALLY, THEY MUST 
AGREE TO INCUR OBLISERV IF REQUIRED.
    C.  DIRECT RATING ENTRY DESIGNATION (RED) RECOMMENDATIONS.  TOP 
SAILORS WHO ARE FULLY QUALIFIED AND HAVE A MINIMUM OF 12 MONTHS 
ONBOARD ARE ELIGIBLE FOR DIRECT DESIGNATION.  SAILORS MAY NOT 
RECEIVE DIRECT DESIGNATION INTO "A" SCHOOL REQUIRED RATINGS.    
4.  APPRENTICESHIP CHANGE CONVERSION REQUESTS.  SAILORS DESIRING A 
RATING OUTSIDE OF CURRENT CAREER TRACK MAY REQUEST CONVERSION TO THE 
APPROPRIATE APPRENTICESHIP IF QUOTAS ARE AVAILABLE (EG. SN-FN, FN-AN).  
SAILORS MUST RECEIVE APPROVAL FOR APPRENTICESHIP CONVERSION PRIOR TO 
REQUESTING RATING DESIGNATION IN THE NEW APPRENTICESHIP CAREER PATH.   
5.  A MONTHLY RACK/STACK PROCESS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN FLEET RIDE.  
TO OPTIMIZE FIT, AND ENSURE FAIR CONSIDERATION FOR ALL APPLICANTS, THE 
RACK/STACK WILL BE BASED ON MOST RECENT EVALUATION, PAYGRADE, TIME AS 
AN APPRENTICE, AND RIDE SCORE.  ALL APPLICATIONS MUST GO THROUGH THE 
RACK/STACK PROCESS TO BE CONSIDERED FOR APPROVAL.  TO ACCOMMODATE 
COMMANDS UNABLE TO ACCESS FLEET RIDE, A SPREADSHEET SUBMISSION PROCESS 
SIMILAR TO THAT CURRENTLY USED FOR PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) WILL BE 
AVAILABLE.  THE SPREADSHEET WILL BE AVAILABLE ON THE NPC WEBSITE IN THE 
QUICK LINKS SECTION UNDER CAREER COUNSELING.  COMMANDS WILL EMAIL 
SPREADSHEETS TO THE FLEET RIDE HELPDESK.  
6.  RATING ENTRY APPLICATION SUBMISSION AND PROCESSING:
    A.  ALL CURRENT RATING ENTRY POLICIES REMAIN IN EFFECT.  SAILORS 
WITH PTS APPLICATIONS CURRENTLY IN PROCESSING ARE ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR 
RATING ENTRY VIA NWAE FOR THE PTS APPROVED RATING.  GENDET AND PACT 
SAILORS MAY NO LONGER SUBMIT NAVPERS 1306/07 FOR NWAE APPROVAL OR "A" 
SCHOOL REQUESTS. 
    B.  NWAE APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED FOR RACK/STACK SEPTEMBER THROUGH 
FEBRUARY WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR THE MARCH NWAE.  MARCH THROUGH AUGUST 
RACK/STACK WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR SEPTEMBER NWAE.  APPLICATIONS FOR 
SEPTEMBER 2009 NWAE MUST BE SUBMITTED IN THE JULY AND AUGUST 2009

7.  TO PREPARE FOR JULY 2009 PROCESSING, ALL CAREER COUNSELORS SHOULD 
IMMEDIATELY ENSURE THEIR FLEET RIDE ACCOUNTS ARE UP-TO-DATE WITH THE 
REQUIRED SYSTEM AUTHORIZATION ACCESS REQUEST FORM ON FILE AT THE FLEET 
RIDE HELPDESK.  ADDITIONALLY, CAREER COUNSELORS SHOULD VERIFY THAT ALL 
NON-DESIGNATED SAILORS ARE QUALIFIED IN FLEET RIDE TO MAXIMIZE THEIR 
OPPORTUNITY FOR RATING ENTRY.  COMMANDS ARE HIGHLY ENCOURAGED TO 
QUALIFY NON-DESIGNATED SAILORS IN FLEET RIDE AT THEIR REPORTING CAREER 
DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO MAXIMIZE RATING ENTRY OPPORTUNITIES.
