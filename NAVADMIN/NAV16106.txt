RMKS/1.  As discussed reference (a), officers with designators 181X, 681X, 
and 781X are designated as Cryptologic Warfare effective immediately.

2.  From the establishment of the Communications Security Group, the 
cryptologic community has continued to evolve to meet and defeat the threats 
it faces.  The transition of the Information Dominance Corps to the 
Information Warfare Community in concert with the Chief of Naval Operations 
Design for Maritime Superiority has given Cryptologists another opportunity 
to formalize this evolution and define community identity.  The Cryptologic 
Warfare designation honors the cryptologic heritage, recognizes the military 
effects these warfighters deliver, and aligns these officers along with Cyber 
Warfare Engineers, Cyber Warrant Officers, and Civilian personnel with their 
enlisted force.

3.  Released By Vice Admiral Ted N. Branch, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations 
for Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
