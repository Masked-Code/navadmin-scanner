RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN is the official notification of eligibility to opt-in 
to the Blended Retirement System (BRS) in accordance with references (a) and 
(b).

2.  Reference (a) states all Service members with a Date of Initial Entry 
into Military Service (DIEMS) on or before 31 December 2017 are automatically 
grandfathered under the current retirement system. However, some Service 
members are eligible to opt-in to the BRS.
    (a)  Active component members are opt-in eligible if their DIEMS is on or 
before 31 December 2017 and they have less than 12 years of service as of 31 
December 2017, based on their Pay Entry Base Date.
    (b)  Reserve component members, to include Full-Time Support members, are 
opt-in eligible if their DIEMS is on or before 31 December 2017 and they have 
accumulated fewer than 4,320 retirement points as of 31 December 2017.
    (c) United States Naval Academy, Reserve Officer Training Corps 
Midshipmen and Delayed Entry Program members are opt-in eligible if their 
DIEMS is on or before 31 December 2017.

3.  The window for opt-in eligible members to enroll in BRS will be open from 
1 January 2018 until 31 December 2018.  Opt-in eligible Service Members must 
be in a paid status at the time of enrollment.  Service Members who meet the 
criteria above but are not in a paid status during the election window, will 
be given an opportunity to enroll during their first period of paid status.  
Hardship extensions to the enrollment window for opt-in eligible Service 
Members who are unable to enroll in BRS during the 2018 enrollment period 
will be considered on a case by case basis in line with reference (a).  If a 
Service Member chooses to opt-in, their decision is irrevocable.  Whether you 
choose to opt-in or not, all Service Members who are opt-in eligible must 
complete the Blended Retirement System Opt-In Course.

4.  Commands must notify all opt-in eligible Service Members within their 
command.  Command administrative departments should also contact their 
personnel support divisions on a regular basis to access a list of all opt-in 
eligible Service Members within their command.  Additionally, those opt-in 
eligible Service members who have an up-to-date email address in Navy 
Standard Integrated Personnel System in line with reference (c) will receive 
notification of opt-in eligibility via e-mail.

5.  All Navy commands must ensure that opt-in eligible Service Members 
complete the Blended Retirement System Opt-In Course.   This course will be 
available in January 2017 on Joint Knowledge Online and Navy E-learning. 
Although this course will be accessible by all Service Members, completion no 
later than 31 December 2017 is mandatory for all opt-in eligible Service 
Members.  Additionally, command financial specialist can provide support for 
unit-level basic financial literacy and BRS education.  More robust financial 
counseling services are available through personal financial managers at your 
local Fleet and Family Support Center or online via a Military OneSource 
personal financial counselor.

6.  The importance of the decision to enroll in BRS or remain in the current 
retirement system cannot be overstated.  This decision is among the most 
important financial decisions an opt-in eligible Service Member may make.  I 
am depending on an all-out leadership effort to ensure that the training is 
completed and Service Members are making the most informed financial decision 
possible.

7.  This NAVADMIN remains in effect until superseded or cancelled, whichever 
comes first.

8.  Released by Vice Admiral R. P. Burke, N1.//
