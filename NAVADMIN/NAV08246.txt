SUBJ/PAYMENT OF DEATH GRATUITY (DG) BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER 
(EFT)// 
REF/A/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON DC/162307Z MAY 08// REF/B/DOC/NPC/25JUL08// 
NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 134/08, DEATH GRATUITY BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION.  
REF B IS MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1770-280, DEATH GRATUITY.// RMKS/1.  THIS 
NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES CHANGES IN PROCEDURES FOR DEATH GRATUITY (DG) 
PAYMENT.  EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, THE PRIMARY METHOD OF PAYMENT OF DG BY 
THE DEFENSE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING SERVICE-CLEVELAND CENTER (DFAS-CL) 
WILL BE ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER (EFT).  RESEARCH HAS INDICATED THAT 
CHECK PAYMENTS, ESPECIALLY IN LARGE AMOUNTS, MAY BE HELD BY MOST 
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR 7 TO 10 BUSINESS DAYS.  EFT PAYMENTS WILL 
IMPROVE THE SECURITY AND SPEED BY WHICH THESE FUNDS WILL BE MADE 
AVAILABLE TO THE ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARY.
2.  PAPER CHECKS WILL ONLY BE OFFERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE IF THE 
BENEFICARY REQUESTS ANOTHER FORM OF PAYMENT.  WHEN A CHECK IS ISSUED, 
DFAS-CL WILL INCLUDE A LETTER THAT PROVIDES THE BANK WITH THE ISSUING 
AUTHORITY'S CONTACT INFORMATION (TO FACILITATE VERIFICATION OF THE 
CHECK'S AUTHENTICITY).  THE ASSIGNED CASUALTY ASSISTANCE CALLS OFFICER 
(CACO) WILL ALSO OFFER TO ACCOMPANY THE ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARY TO THE 
BENEFICIARY'S FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.  CACO'S WILL INFORM BENEFICIARIES 
THAT MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE POLICIES THAT PREVENT IMMEDIATE 
ACCESS TO FUNDS PAID BY CHECK.  ONCE PAYMENT IS MADE, THE ASSIGNED CACO 
WILL NOTIFY OPNAV
(N135C) AND THE CACO'S REGIONAL CASUALTY ASSISTANCE CALLS/FUNERAL 
HONORS PROGRAM MANAGER.
3.  REF A ANNOUNCED CHANGES TO PAYMENT OF THE DG AND EXPLAINED THE 
PRECEDENCE OF ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES.
4.  REF B PROVIDES DG DOCUMENTATION PROCESS INSTRUCTIONS WHEN PAYMENT 
IS MADE VIA EFT AND IS AVAILABLE AT 
HTTP://BUPERSCD.TECHNOLOGY.NAVY.MIL/BUP_UPDT/508/MILPERS/1770-280.HTM.  
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT PROCESSING DG PAYMENTS IS AVAILABLE AT
