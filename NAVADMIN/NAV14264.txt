RMKS/1.  Navy Fleet Post Office (FPO) addresses for ships, mobile units, and 
ashore FPOs are being converted to an address format compatible with the U.S. 
Postal Service*s (USPS) address system, which is similar to the concept used 
for residential addresses across the U.S.  New standardized address formats 
will improve service, reduce mail transit times, and improve efficiency for 
Navy FPO directory services performed afloat and ashore.
    A.  For ships, official mail addresses began converting to the
    new format effective 1 October 2014, with personal address
    conversion starting 15 November 2014.  Fleet Postal Officers and
    Postal Assistance Advisors will directly contact ships to assist
    Supply Officers with implementation guidance.
    B.  For ashore FPOs, the new format is effective immediately and
    will be implemented by Regional Postal Managers and Postal
    Assistance Advisors.
    C.  For Navy mobile units, the new address format is effective
    immediately and will be provided each time a Mobile Routing
    Instruction is requested.

2.  Ships and Mobile Units will include a new unit number and
*virtual* box number along with a 5-digit ZIP Code in the Navy standardized 
address format as follows:
    Line 1:  Name
    Line 2:  Ship or Mobile Unit name
    Line 3:  Ship or Mobile Unit number, box number
    Line 4:  FPO (AP, AE, AA) ZIP Code (5 digits only)

3.  Ashore FPOs now include a Postal Service Center (PSC) number and box 
number along with a 5-digit ZIP Code in the address as follows:
    Line 1: Name
    Line 2: PSC number, box number
    Line 3: FPO (AP, AE, AA), ZIP Code (5 digits only)

4.  Benefits to the Navy using the new address format are:
    A.  Postal patrons will be able to use the USPS*s Internet Change
    of Address process at https://www.usps.com/ when rotating to/from
    new assignments that use FPO addresses.
    B.  USPS mail software requires only 5-digit ZIP Codes on new
    Navy addresses.
    C.  Reduced mail transit times because mail will be automatically
    redirected to new forwarding addresses.

5.  Please ensure widest distribution of new Navy standardized FPO mail 
address format.

6.  This message supersedes all previous FPO address guidance.  Additional 
addressing information and assigned unit addresses / box numbers will be 
provided in upcoming messages from CPF and USFF Fleet Postal Officers.
