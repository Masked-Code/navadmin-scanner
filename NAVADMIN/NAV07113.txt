RMKS/1.  THIS MESSAGE SOLICITS NOMINATIONS FOR THE SURFACE NAVY
ASSOCIATION'S "OLD TAR" AWARD.
2.  THE "OLD TAR" AWARD WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE SURFACE NAVY ASSOCIATION 
(SNA) IN 1996 TO RECOGNIZE THE ACTIVE DUTY ENLISTED SURFACE WARFARE 
SPECIALIST (ESWS) WITH THE EARLIEST DATE OF QUALIFICATION.  THE AWARD 
IS A REPLICA OF THE STATUE "THE CHIEF"
WHICH STANDS AT THE NAVY MEMORIAL IN WASHINGTON, DC.  THE STATUETTE IS 
MOUNTED ON ORIGINAL PLANKING FROM THE USS CONSTITUTION AND REMAINS IN 
THE SACRED CUSTODY FOR DISPLAY BY THE "OLD TAR" AS LONG AS HE/SHE 
SERVES ON ACTIVE DUTY.  THE STATUETTE IS SHIFTED UPON RETIREMENT TO THE 
NEXT "SELECTED" RECIPIENT.
3.  THE CURRENT "OLD TAR" IS MASTER CHIEF ASHLEY SMITH, UNITED STATES 
NAVY WHO IS CURRENTLY ASSIGNED AS COMMAND MASTER CHIEF, USS KITTY HAWK 
(CV-63).  MASTER CHIEF SMITH IS SLATED TO RETIRE IN MAY 2007.
4.  THE CRITERIA FOR THE "OLD TAR" AWARD IS:  ACTIVE DUTY ENLISTED 
SURFACE WARFARE SPECIALIST WITH THE EARLIEST DATE OF QUALIFICATION AS 
RECEIVED BY THE SNA BEFORE THE ANNOUNCED CLOSING DATE FOR NOMINATIONS 
(NOMINEES MUST SUBMIT APPROPRIATE CERTIFIED TRUE COPIES OF PAGE 4 OR 
ESWS CERTIFICATE).  NOMINATIONS RECEIVED AFTER THE CLOSING DATE THAT 
ARE OF AN EARLIER DATE OF QUALIFICATION OF THE SELECTED AWARD WINNER 
WILL RECEIVE A LETTER OF RECOGNITION ONLY.  IN THE EVENT OF MORE THAN
ONE NOMINEE HAVING THE SAME ESWS QUALIFICATION DATE, THE RECIPIENT WILL 
BE DETERMINED FIRST BY THE MOST TIME AT SEA, AND SECONDLY, BY THE PAY 
ENTRY BASE DATE.  IF A CANDIDATE IS QUALIFIED IN MORE THAN ONE 
SPECIALTY AREA, THEIR PRIMARY DESIGNATION MUST BE SURFACE WARFARE.
5.  THE CHANGE IN CUSTODY OF THE "OLD TAR" STATUETTE IS RECOGNIZED AT 
THE SURFACE NAVY ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM HELD IN JANUARY IN 
WASHINGTON, DC.  ALSO, A REPLICA OF THE CHIEF STATUETTE IS PRESENTED TO 
THE RETIRING "OLD TAR".  THE REPLICA PRESENTATION SERVES TO RENEW 
KNOWLEDGE ON THE RECOGNITION; AND AS A REAFFIRMATION OF FAITH BY SNA 
NATIONALLY THAT BECOMING AN ESWS IS, WAS, AND WILL REMAIN IMPORTANT.
THE REPLICA IS PROVIDED FOR HIS/HER RETENTION FOR LIFE WITH A "VERY 
WELL DONE".
6.  IT IS REQUESTED THAT ALL NOMINATIONS BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE 
SURFACE NAVY ASSOCIATION AT 2550 HUNTINGTON AVE., SUITE 202, ALEXANDRIA,
