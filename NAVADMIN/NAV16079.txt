RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the establishment of the Oceanography Chief 
Warrant Officer (CWO) designator, 780X.

2.  In order to meet the increasing demand for officers with specific 
technical meteorology and oceanography knowledge, skills, and abilities,
the Secretary of the Navy has approved the establishment of the Oceanography 
CWO Designator.  Composed of Warrant Officers in the ranks of CWO2 (W-2) 
through CWO5 (W-5), this program provides a deliberate means of identifying, 
developing, and commissioning technically proficient Sailors to provide 
environmental support for the most sophisticated and diverse Naval platforms 
in history.

3.  The establishment of the Oceanography CWO Program will coincide with the 
disestablishment of the Oceanography Limited Duty Officer (LDO) Program and 
associated designator 680X.  Officers in the Oceanography LDO program will 
continue to be afforded promotion and growth opportunity, and are encouraged 
to off-ramp, via lateral transfer, to the Oceanography designator 180X when 
eligible.

4.  In addition to the eligibility criteria outlined in references (a) and 
(b), Sailors must have previously qualified as Aerographers Mate Forecasters 
(NEC 7412).

5.  The first selection of eligible candidates for this designator will occur 
in the FY-18 In-service Procurement Board.

6.  Points of contact are:  CDR Christi Montgomery, Oceanography Community 
Manager, BUPERS 317E, (901) 874-2461/DSN 882 or e-mail
christi.montgomery(at)navy.mil, and CWO5 Elizabeth Rivera, CWO Community
Manager, BUPERS 319, (901) 874-2464/DSN 882 or e-mail
