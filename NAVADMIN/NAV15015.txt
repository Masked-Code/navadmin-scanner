SUBJ/2016 NAVY LEGISLATIVE FELLOWSHIP CALL FOR APPLICATIONS//

AMPN/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1560.21E, LEGISLATIVE FELLOWS PROGRAM//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits applications for the 2016 Navy Legislative 
Fellowship program.  The Legislative Fellows program allows Naval Officers 
and Department of the Navy civilians to broaden their understanding of the 
legislative process and the operation of the U.S. Congress through a year-
long full-time assignment to the office of a Member of the House of 
Representatives or the Senate.  The Legislative Fellows program also enhances 
the Navy’s ability to fulfill its role in the national policy development 
process.

2.  This is a highly competitive program.  Applicants* records must reflect 
sustained superior performance and potential for future assignments in 
critical billets.  Upon completion of the program, officers earn a 
Legislative Additional Qualification Designator. Additionally, there is an 
opportunity to earn a Legislative Studies Certificate through a sponsoring 
agency.

3.  Military Applicants.  Participation is open to unrestricted line 
officers, restricted line officers, and staff corps officers in the permanent 
grades of O-3 through O-5.  The selection process will focus on individual 
performance, promotion potential, academic and subspecialty qualifications, 
needs of the Navy, and availability for follow-on assignment.  Officers with 
permanent change of station orders already issued will not be considered.
    a.  Applicants must be available for permanent change of station 
assignment to Washington, DC, from November 2015 through December 2016.  
During the fellowship, officers will be assigned to the Office of Legislative 
Affairs (OLA) for administrative purposes.  Upon execution of orders, fellows 
agree to serve for three years following completion or termination of the 
fellowship.  A follow-on utilization tour in legislative affairs is preferred 
(making career timing an important consideration), but depends on community-
specific billet requirements, needed officer progression, and availability of 
legislative assignments.  All officer applicants must contact their detailers 
for counseling on the career impact of participation in the Legislative 
Fellowship program.
    b.  Submit applications via e-mail to the OLA point of contact no later 
than 27 February 2015.  Program information and submission guidance are 
available on the Navy Legislative Affairs website at 
http://www.navy.mil/local/ola/legislative_fellowship1.asp.
    c.  Points of contact are LCDR Natalia Henriquez, Navy Fellows Program 
Manager, OLA, at (703) 697-2885/DSN 227 or via e-mail at 
natalia.henriquez(at)navy.mil; and LCDR Angelin Graham, PERS-440, at
(901) 874-4056/DSN 882 or via e-mail at angelin.graham(at)navy.mil.

4.  Civilian Applicants.  Senior civilian employees, GM/GS-13 and above or 
equivalent, interested in the Legislative Fellowship program must contact 
their local civilian training officer for information on submission of 
applications for the 2016 program.  Parent commands are responsible for all 
program costs.  Questions concerning Department of the Navy civilian 
participation should be directed to Ms. Janet Evans at (202) 685-6493 or via 
e-mail at janet.m.evans(at)navy.mil. A description of the program can be 
found at

5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.

6.  Released by Vice Admiral W. F. Moran, N1.
