SUBJ/TEMPORARY INCREASE IN BAH RATES IN SELECT AREAS//

NARR/REF A IS TITLE 37 U.S.C. 403(B)(8), BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR HOUSING.   
REF B TEMPORARY INCREASE IN BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR HOUSING RATES APPROVED BY THE 
DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL POLICY.// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces temporary basic allowance for 
housing (BAH) increases for Sailors authorized BAH in 28 military 
housing areas (MHA) from 1 October 2022 to 31 December 2022. 
 
2.  In line with references (a) and (b), the Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Military Personnel Policy has approved temporary BAH rate 
increases for MHAs that have experienced an average increase of 20 percent or 
more in rental housing costs as determined by rental housing market data 
collected by the Department of Defense (DoD) from March to August 2022.  Navy 
centric MHAs listed include San Diego, CA (CA038), Miami/Fort Lauderdale, FL 
(FL061), Kings Bay/Brunswick, GA (GA074), Newport, RI (RI256), and 
Providence, RI (RI257).  A full list of the 28 MHAs impacted and frequently 
asked questions can be found at  
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/References/Pay-Benefits/N130C/.  It is 
important to note that if your MHA is not listed, you are not eligible for a 
BAH increase.  Sailors are encouraged to review the 
BAH rate charts carefully as rates vary within MHAs (i.e. some ranks may not 
see an increase). 
 
3.  The increased BAH rates are automatic and are only payable from 
1 October 2022 to 31 December 2022 for Sailors authorized a housing 
allowance in 1 of the 28 impacted MHAs.  No application nor supporting 
documentation is required, the increase will automatically be applied to 
those entitled to BAH in the affected MHAs.  Temporary increases in BAH rates 
are not subject to rate protection, which means that it is possible Sailors 
will see lower or higher BAH rates when the 2023 BAH rates become effective 
on 1 January 2023.  That said, the temporary 2022 rates are based on the 
same data being used in determining 2023 BAH rates and DoD is making every 
effort to ensure these rates remain as stable as possible as we transition 
into 2023.  Because the temporary rates vary within each MHA (dependent on 
rank) and depend on actual rental market data, the BAH increase for those in 
the 28 MHAs may be less or more than 20 percent. 
 
4.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or 31 December 2022, 
whichever occurs first.
