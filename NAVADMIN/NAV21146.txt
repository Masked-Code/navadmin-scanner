ASSIGNMENT PAY.// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the annual special duty assignment pay 
(SDAP) recertification process for fiscal year (FY) 2021.  In line with 
references (a) and (b), commanding officers (CO) are required to annually 
review and certify the entitlement to SDAP for each Sailor.  This 
recertification is vital in verifying that every Sailor who is assigned to an 
eligible billet remains qualified to fill that billet and is receiving the 
correct level of SDAP. 
 
2.  Certification shall commence upon the release of this NAVADMIN and 
continue through 31 August 2021.  Enlisted Incentive Program Department 
(BUPERS-328) will stop SDAP for all SDAP recipients at all commands failing 
to complete the recertification process on time.  Commands should prioritize 
timely completion of this process to preclude pay disruptions for eligible 
Sailors.  SDAP recertification reports received at BUPERS-328 will not be 
forwarded to the servicing personnel support detachment (PSD).  Any action 
required to start, stop or change the level of SDAP of a Sailor must be 
submitted to PSD via the command pay and personnel administrator 
(CPPA) using the transaction online processing system (TOPS). 
 
3.  To verify if a Sailor is eligible and receiving the correct level of 
SDAP, a complete list of authorized skills and pay amounts can be found by 
visiting the MyNavy Portal (MNP) website at  
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Enlisted-Career-Admin/SRB-SDAP-Enl-Bonus/, then scroll to 
and click on *SDAP Levels with Admin Updates.* 
 
4.  Follow these procedures to certify the SDAP report of your Command. 
    a.  Obtain and print the annual SDAP report of your command. The annual 
SDAP report only pulls those Sailors that are currently drawing SDAP.  The 
report will not highlight potentially eligible Sailors who are not currently 
receiving SDAP. 
        (1) The command annual SDAP report may be obtained by sending a 
digitally signed e-mail to the SDAP recertification report help desk at 
mill_sdap_recert.fct(at)navy.mil.  You may also contact BUPERS-328 at 
(901)874-3260/DSN 882 for additional assistance with this process. 
        (2) Annual SDAP report requesters are to include their primary unit 
identification code (UIC) in the subject line and any required subordinate 
UICs in the e-mail body. 
        (3) Reports will only be provided to command career management 
system-interactive detailing (CMS-ID) users with the activity manning manager 
(AMM) role.  Requester must have CMS-ID AMM access for all subordinate UICs 
requested.  Commands with no AMM will need to submit a CMS-ID AMM access 
request which can be found by visiting the MNP website at  
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Portals/55/Career/Detailing/MyNavyAssignment/My
Navy_Assignment_Access.pdf 
        (4) The SDAP report will be returned as an attachment either in an 
encrypted e-mail or via the Department of Defense Secure Access File Exchange 
at https://safe.apps.mil/. 
    b.  Verify your command as a whole and make changes as follows: 
        (1) Add all Sailors who are eligible for SDAP, but not listed in the 
annual SDAP report.  To add, simply handwrite or type the name, rate, 
effective date and level on the bottom of the annual SDAP report.  If there 
is not enough space, attach a list on command letterhead. 
        (2) Draw a line through any Sailor who is no longer eligible and 
provide a brief description (transfer/separation/loss of Navy enlisted 
classifications). 
        (3) Verify levels are in line with the most recent SDAP 
eligibility chart by visiting the MNP website at 
https://mynavyhr.navy.afpims.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Enlisted-Career-Admin/SRB-SDAP-Enl-Bonus, then scroll to and click 
on *SDAP Levels with Admin Updates.* 
        (4) The original signature of the CO must be on each page of the 
annual SDAP report accompanied by the following statement, *After review, I 
certify that all required additions and changes have been annotated, actions 
required to start, stop, increase or decrease has been processed via PSD 
prior to submission of recertification and all Sailors at this command are 
receiving the correct SDAP entitlement.*  This statement can be handwritten, 
typed or affixed by a label.  A cover letter is not required, however it 
may be included if additional space is required to add SDAP eligible Sailors 
or if an explanation of changes is warranted. 
        (5) Provide a point of contact in the top right-hand corner of the 
first page of the annual SDAP report. 
        (6) Send the SDAP report via encrypted e-mail to 
mill_incen_pays.fct(at)navy.mil.  The e-mail subject line must 
contain UIC and point of contact with rate, name, phone number and  
e-mail.  You may also contact BUPERS-328 at (901)874-3260/DSN 882 for 
additional assistance with this process. 
        (7) If you are having trouble sending encrypted e-mail, ensure that 
your encryption e-mail certificate is posted to the global address list.  If 
you are still having encryption issues, contact BUPERS-328 at (901) 874-
3260/DSN 882. 
        (8) E-mail is the preferred method, but if you need to send the 
report via regular mail, please send to 
            Navy Personnel Command 
            Enlisted Incentive Program Department (BUPERS-328) 
            5720 Integrity Drive 
            Millington TN 38055-0130 
 
5.  Should a service record or payment update becomes necessary, each command 
is responsible for completing this action though their local servicing 
PSD.  All corrective transactions older than 240 days will be processed by 
BUPERS-328 via an emailed request submitted to 
mill_incen_pays.fct(at)navy.mil. 
 
6.  Commands can check the status of their SDAP recertification at 
https://mynavyhr.navy.afpims.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Enlisted-Career-Admin/SRB-SDAP-Enl-Bonus, then scroll to the SDAP 
section and click on *SDAP Delinquent List.*  Immediate superior in commands 
(ISIC) are strongly encouraged to use this site to ensure all subordinate 
commands have completed the recertification.  Please allow 5 to 10 days after 
submission for the webpage to be updated. 
 
7.  For commands who had SDAP payments stopped as a result of failing to 
complete the required process in time, SDAP can only be restored by BUPERS-
328.  SDAP can be restored for delinquent commands upon completion of the 
directed recertification process with the added requirement of an ISIC 
endorsement.  This endorsement cannot be signed by direction nor by an acting 
ISIC.  A list of delinquent commands will be forwarded to the Chief of Naval 
Personnel and the N1 staffs at U.S. Fleet Forces and U.S. Pacific Fleet via 
the Military Pay and Compensation Branch (OPNAV N130). Once the 
recertification and ISIC endorsement are received by BUPERS-328, suspended 
SDAP payments will resume, to include back pay for any missed payments. 
 
8.  It is recognized that the recertification process is burdensome for 
Sailors and commands.  OPNAV N130 is working with Navy Pay and Personnel 
(NP2) programmers to embed recertification functions within the next 
generation of pay systems to improve process efficiency.  Until these systems 
are deployed, the current process must be followed with care to ensure 
continued payment of entitlements to all eligible Sailors. 
 
9.  Point of contact.  BUPERS-328, mill_incen_pays.fct(at)navy.mil, 
(901) 874-3260/DSN 882. 
 
10.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or 1 October 2021, 
whichever occurs first.
