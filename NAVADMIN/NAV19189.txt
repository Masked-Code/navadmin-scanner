SUBJ/NOTICE OF CONVENING FY-20 ACTIVE-DUTY NAVY CAPTAIN AND COMMANDER 
SELECTIVE EARLY RETIREMENT BOARDS//

RMKS/1.  The Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) approved the convening of fiscal 
year (FY) 2020 selective early retirement (SER) boards in order to consider 
captains and commanders in the line and staff corps on the active-duty list 
for early retirement.  The captain SER boards will convene on 20 September 
2019.  The commander SER boards will convene on 11 September 2019.

2.  As in FY-19, the SECNAV is convening the FY-20 SER boards in order to 
ensure the highest quality officer corps in the senior grades of captain and 
commander.  Our growing Navy requires the most consistently reliable top 
performers to lead and sustain a modern, ready and lethal force as the number 
of ships, squadrons and required manpower levels increase.  The Navy is 
committed to retaining and promoting the best leaders to meet the challenges 
of tomorrow, and to enforcing the highest performance standards for Navy 
leaders.  Our junior officers and enlisted Sailors deserve the best senior 
officers to emulate and lead them.  Each SER board will select only those 
officers whose early retirement, in the opinion of a majority of the board 
members, is in the best interest of the Navy.  When determining those 
officers who should be recommended for early retirement, the SER boards will 
consider a number of factors, including performance, the requirement for 
exemplary conduct, and adverse information.  The majority of eligible 
officers whose records will be considered by the SER boards are fully capable 
of performing the duties of their current grade.  Selecting zero officers in 
a competitive category is an acceptable outcome for the SER boards because no 
mandatory quotas are established.  The process of reviewing records and 
selecting officers for early retirement ensures the Navy will have a 
professional, healthy senior officer corps that is ready to meet the demands 
of the Navy the Nation needs.

3.  Captains and commanders whose records were considered by the FY-
19 SER boards may again be considered by the FY-20 SER boards.  In order to 
meet the Navys needs, the Secretary of Defense has authorized the SECNAV to 
waive the statutory limitation in section
638(c) of title 10, U.S. Code, which prohibits a captain or commander from 
being considered by a SER board more than once in a 5 year period.

4.  The following officers may be considered by the SER board:
    a.  Captains.  Captains with 3 or more years time in grade when the SER 
board convenes, and in the year groups and zone for their respective 
competitive category listed in paragraph 6.
    b.  Commanders.  Commanders who have failed selection for promotion to 
the grade of captain two or more times, and in the year groups and zone for 
their respective competitive category listed in paragraph 6.

5.  The following officers are not eligible for consideration by the SER 
board:
    a.  Officers with approved voluntary retirement requests.
    b.  Officers with statutory retirements in FY-19 or FY-20.
    c.  Officers whose names are on a list of officers recommended for 
promotion.

6.  The following list indicates the name, active-duty list (lineal) number 
and date of rank of the senior officer and junior officer eligible for early 
retirement in all competitive categories of the line and staff corps for the 
grades of captain and commander.  Each junior officer eligible, each senior 
officer eligible and all officers whose lineal number falls between the 
senior and junior officers eligible will be considered by the SER board, 
subject to the limitations in paragraph 5.
