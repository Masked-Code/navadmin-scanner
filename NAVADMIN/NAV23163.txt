SUBJ/THE 250TH BIRTHDAY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA// 
 
RMKS/1. In 2026 the U.S. Navy will conduct an International Naval Review 
(INR) to commemorate the 250th birthday of the United States of America.   
This event will be a celebration of the American spirit and the unquenchable 
thirst for liberty that earned our young nation its independence in 1776. 
 
2.  To celebrate 250 years as a maritime nation, the U.S. Navy will 
develop and conduct an INR highlighting our partnerships with sea services 
from around the world.  We will align community outreach events in every 
region and leverage our fleet weeks, Navy weeks, Blue Angels air shows, and 
United States Navy Museums to tell our story during this nation-wide 
commemoration of the 250th birthday of the United States of America. 
 
3.  In that spirit, I direct the following actions:

fleet weeks, Navy weeks, Blue Angels air shows, and Navy Museums special 
exhibits should promote the themes and messages across the nation. 
e.  OPNAV N3N5 will prioritize plans for the nations 7th INR to take place on 
4 July 2026 in New York City Harbor. 
f.  NHHC will utilize its network of more than 1,500 educational and historic 
institutions to promote the 250th birthday of the United States of America. 
g.  USFFC, as the officer conducting exercise, will execute the fleet portion 
of the INR and supporting events. 
 
4.  As the past informs the present and guides our nation to the future, the 
2026 International Naval Review will commemorate our rich national history 
and maritime heritage.  It will showcase the strength of our Navy and our 
partners to the world, and it will inspire the next generation of Americans 
who will serve in the U.S. Navy of tomorrow.
