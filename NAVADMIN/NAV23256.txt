4.  Selections are conditional upon the selectee remaining fully eligible in 
all respects, meeting physical qualifications for commissioning as determined 
by the bureau of medicine and surgery (BUMED), and assignment by naval 
service training command (NSTC) to an approved Naval reserve officers 
training corps (NROTC) affiliated university based upon an official degree 
plan and acceptance letter from the university.  Upon completion of an NSTC 
approved baccalaureate degree program, selectees will receive appointments as 
ensigns, USN. 
 
5.  Commanding officers should take the following actions: 
    a.  Notify selectees and alternates of their selection and ensure they 
receive a copy of this message. 
    b.  Notify NSTC N92 selection and placement (N92/STA-21) via e-mail 
at GRLK_STA21@navy.mil no later than 1 December 2023 of any selectee or 
alternate who does not desire to participate in the program. 
    c.  Immediately report to NSTC (N92/STA-21) all conditions or 
circumstances that may disqualify a selectee or alternate from participating 
in the STA-21 program via e-mail at GRLK_STA21@navy.mil. 
 
6.  Selectees and alternates should take the following actions: 
    a.  Complete a physical examination for a training program leading to a 
commission in the unrestricted line, nurse corps, or civil engineering corps, 
as applicable, in accordance with references (a) and (b) at a military 
treatment facility.  Note that many commissioning standards exceed the 
enlisted standards required to remain on active duty. 
    b.  Ensure copies of completed physicals, report of medical history 
(DD2807-1), and report of medical examination (DD2808), including human 
immunodeficiency virus results from a test taken after 1 January 2023, are 
submitted no later than 30 December 2023 to: 
 
Commander 
Naval Service Training Command 
Attn:  N92/STA-21 
320A Dewey Avenue BLDG 3 
ROOM 106 
Great Lakes, IL 60088-2845 
or via DOD-safe (https://safe.apps.mil/).   
 
Aviation option selectees/alternates must have flight physicals uploaded 
directly into aeromedical electronic resource office by a flight surgeon, and 
submitted to Naval aerospace medical institute.  The selectees and 
alternates must be certified as qualified or have a waiver recommended by 
Naval medicine operation training center.  All required physical forms can be 
downloaded from the STA-21 homepage at 
https://www.netc.navy.mil/Commands/Naval-Service-Training-Command/STA-
21/.  Commands should not forward physical forms directly to BUMED. 
    c.  Send acceptance letters from no more than three NROTC host or NROTC 
cross-town affiliated universities to the NSTC address listed above or via 
DOD-safe.  Application to more than one university is advisable.  Selectees 
will begin the STA-21 program with attendance at the Naval science institute 
(NSI) in one of two classes starting no later than 12 February 2024 or 1 
April 2024 for 
a 6-week period. 
    d.  Send an official degree plan from an NROTC host or NROTC cross-town 
affiliated university where they have been accepted. 
Degree plans must cover the time actually attending college.  Degree plans of 
selectees should begin with the summer term 2024.  All STA-21 selectees will 
be required to attend the NSI enroute to their assigned university. 
 
7.  Alternates:  Each alternate must complete the same actions outlined in 
paragraph 6 of this message.  If a primary selectee declines participation in 
the program, is determined to be not physically qualified, or otherwise 
becomes ineligible for continuation in the program prior to executing orders, 
a qualified alternate will be selected.  This notification often comes at the 
last minute, therefore, alternates who desire participation in the STA-21 
program need to be complete with the actions listed above when notified. 
 
8.  The deadline for required degree plans and college admission 
documentation is 1 December 2023.  It is in the best interest of each 
selectee and alternate to submit verification of eligibility criteria as soon 
as possible to expedite university assignment and release of permanent change 
of station orders.  Selectees will not be ordered to NSI en route to their 
assigned NROTC university until all conditions outlined in paragraph 6 have 
been met. 
 
9.  The preferred method of delivery of all documents is through DOD-safe 
utilizing email GRLK_STA21@navy.mil (ensure an email with the encrypted 
passphrase is also sent to GRLK_STA21@navy.mil). Documents can also be mailed 
to the address above. 
 
10.  Points of contact are: 
    a. Mr. Jim Branch, james.r.branch8.civ@us.navy.mil. 
    b. Mr. David Burmeister, david.a.burmeister.civ@us.navy.mil. 
 
11.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
