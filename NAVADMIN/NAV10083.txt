RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
 AND ADVANCEMENT POLICY CHANGES THAT BECOME EFFECTIVE 1 AUGUST 2010.  
THESE CHANGES ARE A RESULT OF FEEDBACK FROM SELECTION BOARDS AND 
INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION MANPOWER MANAGEMENT ASSIGNMENT/GLOBAL SUPPORT 
ASSIGNMENT (IAMM/GSA) PARTICIPANTS.  SPECIFIC CHANGES WILL INCLUDE:
    A.  REGULAR REPORTING SENIORS WILL IDENTIFY THOSE 
SAILORS/OFFICERS PERFORMING AN IAMM/GSA ASSIGNMENT BY CLASSIFICATION 
IN A NEW BILLET SUBCATEGORY CODE.  THIS BILLET SUBCATEGORY IS BEING 
ADDED TO ENSURE IAMM/GSA SAILORS ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR SERVICE 
AWAY FROM THEIR PARENT COMMAND AND REMAIN COMPETITIVE WITH THEIR 
COUNTERPARTS WHO ARE PRESENT AT AND EVALUATED BY THEIR PARENT
COMMAND. 
    B.  BOTH CONCURRENT IAMM/GSA AND REGULAR EVALUATIONS WILL BE 
USED TO DETERMINE PERFORMANCE MARK AVERAGES (PMA) AND TIME IN RATE 
(TIR) WAIVERS.  THIS ENSURES OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE WHILE ON 
IAMM/GSA IS PROPERLY REWARDED. 
    C.  REPORTING SENIORS WILL DOCUMENT ALL OFFICIAL PHYSICAL 
FITNESS ASSESSMENTS (PFAS) CONDUCTED DURING A REPORTING PERIOD USING 
NEW PFA CODES ON FITREPS/EVALS (BLOCK 20).  THIS CHANGE REINFORCES 
THE REQUIREMENT THAT COMMANDS MUST MAINTAIN ACCURATE DATA IN PHYSICAL
 READINESS INFORMATION MAINTENANCE SYSTEM (PRIMS) AND PROVIDES 
SELECTION BOARDS WITH ACCURATE INFORMATION CONCERNING A MEMBER'S PFA 
PERFORMANCE DURING THAT REPORTING PERIOD.
2.  THESE CHANGES WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL PERFORMANCE REPORTS WITH 
AN END DATE OF 1 AUGUST 2010 OR LATER.  THIS ALLOWS FOR RECERTIFICATION 
OF OUR 
FITREP/EVAL SOFTWARE, MAINTAINS OUR FY10 STATUTORY BOARD SCHEDULE AND
 MINIMIZES IMPACT TO OUR SAILORS AND THE ADVANCEMENT PROCESS.  BUSINESS 
RULES WILL BE DETAILED 
IN SUBSEQUENT NAVADMINS, PER THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULE:
  15 MAY 2010 - PFA DOCUMENTATION
  15 JUNE 2010 - IAMM/GSA CHANGES
  15 JULY 2010 - NAVFIT98 ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION CHANGES
BUPERSINST 1610.10C WILL BE PROMULGATED IN JULY 2010, AND WILL BECOME
