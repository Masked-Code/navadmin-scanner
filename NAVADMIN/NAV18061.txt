RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the June 2018 Active Duty 
Officer Lateral Transfer/Redesignation Board.  The lateral transfer and 
redesignation process is a key tool by which the Navy manages the talents of 
its officers.  It provides flexibility in officer community manning and 
improves the return on investment in officer training and education for the 
Navy by leveraging the specialized skillsets of officers throughout their 
careers.  As part of the process, applications from qualified unrestricted 
line, restricted line (RL), staff corps, and limited duty officers (LDO) are 
now being accepted for the Active Duty Officer Lateral Transfer/Redesignation 
Board which convenes 4 June 2018.  Full-time Support and Selected Reserve 
officers are not eligible to apply for this board.

2.  In addition to the year group (YG) limitations imposed in paragraph 6, 
applicants must also meet eligibility requirements detailed in references (a) 
through (c), and are required to review and comply with any additional 
community requirements found in the June 2018 Letter of Instruction located 
at: http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/boards/administrative/ 
TransferRedesignation/Pages/Status.aspx.
    a.  Officers who do not meet eligibility requirements in line with 
references (a) through (c) such as time-in-grade, years-of-commissioned 
service (YCS), or time-in-service must submit a waiver request in addition to 
or in conjunction with their lateral transfer/redesignation application as 
specified by specific communities.
    b.  A waiver request must include the commanding officer (CO) endorsement 
and a waiver request letter of the officer.  The CO may endorse the waiver in 
the same letter as the lateral transfer package endorsement.
    c.  Active Component LDOs in the Supply Corps (651X) and Information 
Warfare Community (68XX) are designated for off-ramp as listed in reference 
(j).  Those who are eligible and desire to redesignate within their parent 
communities should submit their requests in line with reference (j) vice this 
board.

3.  Submit applications and waiver requests (as required), using the format 
in reference (b) via email to cscselboard(at)navy.mil.  Email subject line 
should reflect *Board Package:  Board No. 240*.  If no means of electronic

7.  Notes:
    a.  Must have Surface Warfare Officer (SWO) qualification completed to 
apply for transfer.  Officers under SWO Continuation Pay Revised Junior 
Critical Skills Retention Bonus, SWO Lieutenant Commander (LCDR) Retention 
Bonus or Department Head (DH) Retention Bonus contract are not eligible for 
transfer until completion of bonus obligation.  SWOs serving under an 
agreement for any of the SWO bonuses are eligible to apply to the board if 
the board convening date is within one year of satisfaction of the full bonus 
obligation.  Quotas out may be limited due to manning levels for any given 
YG, community billet requirements, the status of DH contract goals for YGs 
with less than six YCS, and the assignment status of the individual officer.  
Officers within their detailing window must communicate with their detailer 
prior to submitting a lateral transfer application.  Executing orders, 
slating to a billet, or serving in a hard fill billet or one with significant 
training required could disqualify an officer for consideration and release 
from the community until arrival to the next duty station or upon completion 
of a minimum activity tour.  Requests for lateral transfer out of the SWO 
community from LCDR and above will be considered on a case-by-case basis due 
to shortages in these grades.
    b.  Waivers to the requirements of paragraph 4h of reference (b) for 
nuclear-trained Surface and Submarine Warfare Officers may be considered on a 
case-by-case basis.
    c.  Officers commissioned under a still-valid SWO-option agreement 
(Engineering Duty (ED), Intelligence, Information Professional, Cryptologic 
Warfare, Oceanography (OCEANO)) must contact their respective RL option 
community manager regarding desire to be released from the SWO-option 
agreement and seek lateral transfer to a different community.
    d.  Nuclear-trained SWOs YG-12 and senior are available for lateral 
transfer consideration.  YG-13 is open to officers applying to EDO(N) only.
    e.  Officers screened *not cleared* for their next career milestone are 
eligible.
    f.  The YG range provided displays possible opportunities. Contact your 
specific community placement officer with questions regarding quota 
availability for each Type/Model/Series/YG.  General aviation officers (1300) 
are eligible to apply for lateral transfer regardless of Active-Duty Service 
Obligation (ADSO) from winging. Aviation officers (131X and 132X) are 
eligible to apply for lateral transfer if the officer has fulfilled ADSO, or 
will be within 12 months of completing ADSO at the time the board convenes.  
Aviation officers with obligated service as a result of Aviation Bonus (AvB) 
are eligible to apply if the officer will be within 12 months of completing 
AvB obligation at the time the board convenes. Additionally, aviation 
officers with obligated service as a result of AvB are eligible to apply if 
the officer will be within 12 months of DH tour projected rotation date (PRD) 
at the time the board convenes, regardless of contrary AvB contract language. 
Redesignation immediately following DH tour may result in cancellation of 
Aviation Incentive Pay (AvIP) and AvB, which will be adjudicated by Aviation 
Officer Assignment (PERS-43).  Graduates from U.S. Naval Test Pilot School 
class 150 and 151 may apply for Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer (AEDO) 
only, regardless of ADSO (contact AEDO Officer Community Manager (OCM) for 
details).  If selected, Aviation Officers should expect to redesignate 
immediately.  Exceptions may be made for the completion of ADSO, 
fulfillment/expiration/cancellation of AvB contract, or PRD, as determined by 
Aviation OCM (BUPERS-313).  Officers selected to AEDO should expect to 
redesignate immediately.  Aviation Officers in operational flying billets 
(billet designator XXX1 or XXX2) will not redesignate until vacating the 
billet.  BUPERS-313 authorizes redesignation timing.  By accepting a lateral 
transfer out of Aviation (13XX) an officer consents to voluntary termination 
of flight status (except for AEDO selects) effective the date of 
redesignation with the lateral transfer application and CO endorsement 
fulfilling the requirements set forth in reference (h).
    g.  ED Community.
        (1) Applicants desiring out quota from ED:
            (a) ED out-quotas are extremely limited.  Redesignation requests 
must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis with careful consideration given to 
impact on overall community health.
            (b) Applicants must have fulfilled at least 24 months of their 
postgraduate education payback tour in order to apply.
        (2) Applicants desiring redesignation to ED:
            (a) Officers without a warfare qualification are expected to 
submit an application for the ED Dolphin Program in line with reference (i).
            (b) Applicants from YGs 15-12 (paragraph 6c) are desired.  YG 11-

board.  Applicants from YG 08 are desired if applicants are currently 
enrolled in or have completed an approved Masters Degree.  See MILPERSMAN 
1212-040 for a list of approved degrees and corresponding subspecialty codes.
    h.  Civil Engineer Corps (CEC) Officers under a CEC Critical Skills 
Retention Bonus (CSRB) contract are eligible to apply to the board if the 
board application due date is within one year of satisfaction of the full 
bonus obligation.  Officers with more than one year of obligation remaining 
on their CEC CSRB contract may submit a waiver to be released prior to 
fulfillment of their bonus obligation.  Waivers shall be submitted to the CEC 
OCM for review on a case-by-case basis and can be submitted with the 
application.  If approved, the notice of approval for early release from the 
CSRB contract shall be included with the lateral transfer application. 
Release from the CSRB contract will be considered a voluntary release subject 
to repayment of any unearned amount.
    i.  LDO redesignation requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, 
considering impact to overall community health.  Nuclear LDO submissions will 
not be considered.  All other designators must have completed four YCS and 
accepted permanent LDO appointment to LT prior to lateral 
transfer/redesignation.  LDO out quotas are extremely limited but special 
consideration will be given to officers projected to be statutorily separated 
for years of service prior to attaining the rank of commander.
    j.  Officers YG 15 and senior seeking lateral transfer into the Surface 
Warfare Community are strongly encouraged to contact the SWO OCM prior to 
applying in order to discuss critical SWO career milestone requirements.
    k.  Naval Special Warfare (NSW) will no longer consider or select lateral 
transfers via this board.  All applicants will be considered by a separate 
NSW selection process and must submit their application via current OCM to 
the Sea Air Land (SEAL) OCM.  More information, including required 
application contents and submission due dates, can be found on the SEAL OCM

    n.  YG-15 has highest anticipated inventory requirement. Inventory 
requirements for YGs 08 and 09 are met.  However, the HR community is 
targeting increased inventory for OA subspecialists. YGs 08 and 09 applicants 
with 321X subspecialty from completed graduate education and/or experience

opportunity for YG 06 applicants for lateral transfer.
    o.  HR applicants without a masters degree resulting in 3XXX 
subspecialty, shall request to have their APC calculated by Naval
