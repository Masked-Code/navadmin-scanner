RMKS/1.  THE NAVY CHAPLAIN CORPS WILL CELEBRATE ITS 233RD BIRTHDAY ON 
28 NOVEMBER 2008.  MINISTRY AND SERVICE TO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE SEA 
SERVICES HAS BEEN THE HALLMARK OF THE CHAPLAIN CORPS.  EACH DAY, 
CHAPLAINS AND RELIGIOUS PROGRAM SPECIALISTS WORK TOGETHER REACHING OUT

ENCOURAGEMENT.  THEY ARE IN EVERY CORNER OF THE GLOBE ON SHIPS AT SEA, 
IN THE DESERTS OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, OFF THE COAST OF OUR OWN SHORES 
AND AT BASES THROUGHOUT AMERICA AND OVERSEAS.

NEEDS OF THOSE WHO SERVE BY FACILITATING DIVERSE RELIGIOUS REQUIREMENTS,
