SUBJ/2024 CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS PROFESSIONAL READING PROGRAM// 
 
RMKS/1. Nearly two centuries ago, Navy leaders took the first step in 
establishing a professional education program to help train and educate 
Sailors beyond apprenticeship at sea. Knowing well the importance of using 
lessons from our past to help think through the challenges of the present and 
future, these leaders provided the Fleet with a library of 37 recommended 
books. They knew it was important for our Navy to be a learning organization 
- with people who think critically and seek professional and warfighting 
excellence - in order to remain the world's premier warfighting force. 
 
2. I am continuing that momentum with a warfighting-focused Chief of Naval 
Operations Professional Reading Program (CNO-PRP) to support your 
professional development, broaden your knowledge, and challenge your 
thinking. This list of 14 books aligns with my "America's Warfighting Navy," 
published in January, where I outlined my priorities of warfighting, 
warfighters, and the foundation that supports them. 
 
3. I encourage each of you to read the CNO-PRP. The ideas found in these 
books will not only expand your thinking, but also directly contribute to 
maintaining our warfighting advantage. They support the development of Great 
People, Great Leaders, and Great Teams that can out-think any adversary 
anytime and anywhere. Most importantly, they will make our Navy stronger and 
more ready to preserve the peace, respond in crisis, and win decisively in 
war, if called. 
 
4. This book list will be periodically updated to ensure we keep pace with 
the changing character of war. The list, as well as updates to the list, will 
be posted here: https://www.navy.mil/Leadership/Chief-of-Naval-
Operations/Chief-of-Naval-Operations-Professional-Reading-Library/. 
 
5. Admiral Franchetti sends, the 33rd Chief of Naval Operations.
