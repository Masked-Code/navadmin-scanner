WARFARE (IW) CAPABILITIES AND CONCEPTS (DEFINED REFS A AND B) ARE KEY 
ELEMENTS UPON WHICH THE COOPERATIVE STRATEGY FOR 21ST CENTURY SEAPOWER

SEAPOWER MISSIONS OF FORWARD PRESENCE, DETERRENCE, SEA CONTROL, POWER 
PROJECTION, MARITIME SECURITY, AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE/DISASTER 
RESPONSE PROVIDE FOUNDATIONAL CAPABILITIES THAT ARE WELL-SUITED TO 
ADAPT TO THE EVOLVING DEMANDS AND MISSIONS OF IW.

GLOBAL FLEET STATIONS AND OUR EFFORTS WITH GLOBAL MARITIME PARTNERSHIPS 
AND MARITIME HEADQUARTERS/WITH MARITIME OPERATIONS CENTERS ARE EXAMPLES 
OF HOW THE NAVY HAS ADAPTED TO ADDRESS IW DEMANDS AND MISSIONS. RECENT 
SUCCESSES IN COORDINATING THE EVOLUTION OF NAVY INTELLIGENCE AND STRIKE 
CAPABILITIES TO MEET URGENT COMBATANT COMMANDER REQUIREMENTS FOR 
COMBATING TERRORISM AND COUNTERINSURGENTS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED FURTHER 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE NAVY TO CONTRIBUTE.
