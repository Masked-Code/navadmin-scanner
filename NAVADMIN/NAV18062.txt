RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides information and updates on the Navy’s 
participation in the Defense Attache Service (DAS) for Navy personnel.

2.  The Navy looks to its most qualified and capable officers and enlisted 
personnel to fill demanding and rewarding positions as Senior Defense 
Officials/Defense Attaches, Naval Attaches, Assistant Naval Attaches, 
Operations Coordinators and Operations Assistants in exotic and unique 
locations.  They will serve as a part of the U.S. Defense Attache Office 
(USDAO) team, based at U.S. Embassies in 78 countries.  All candidates are 
trained at the Defense Intelligence Agency’s (DIA) 13-week Joint Military 
Attache School, and depending on their assigned country, extensive language 
training may be provided prior to arriving on station.  Naval Attaches are 
the voice of the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) and Chief of Naval 
Operations, articulating policies as well as Navy strategy to a host nation.  
Naval Attaches observe and report information to reduce strategic surprise, 
and call attention to issues that will affect U.S. interests in time for 
decision makers to act.  Naval Attaches have provided observations that have 
been briefed at the highest levels of government.  Our Naval Attaches build 
strong, lasting relationships with partners who share a common vision of 
maritime security.  As part of the U.S. Embassy country team and in support 
of the Ambassadors objectives, Naval Attaches play a critical role in 
enhancing relationships in host nations which are not traditional or long-
time partners.

3.	The SECNAV considers the Navy’s contribution to the DAS as one of his 
most critical responsibilities, as expanded upon in references (a) and (b).  
For Naval Attaches, SECNAV is the final approval authority for officers 
nominated to serve in the DAS under DIA.  The Director of Naval Intelligence 
manages the day-to-day operation of the Navy Attache Program as detailed in 
reference (c).

4.	For those who meet the selection criteria of references (d) and (e), 
service in the DAS offers unique opportunities for the best and most highly 
qualified Navy personnel.  Through a robust, competitive selection and 
training process, service members and their families will ultimately be 
posted at U.S. Embassies around the world in one of more than 150 DAS 
positions.
a.	Over the next year, Navy Attache Affairs will screen for attache 
positions in:  Albania, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burma, 
Cameroon, Chile, China, Djibouti, Ecuador, Egypt, Fiji, France, Germany, 
Greece, Honduras, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kenya, 
Madagascar, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Philippines, 
Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Tunisia, United Arab 
Emirates, Ukraine, and United Kingdom.
b.	In addition, exceptional Limited Duty Officer/Chief Warrant Officer and 
enlisted personnel will be able to screen as Operations Coordinators (OPSCO) 
and Operations Assistants (OPSAsst) positions in:  Australia, China, 
Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Malaysia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, United 
Kingdom, Uruguay, and Vietnam.

5.	To demonstrate the importance SECNAV places on duty at DAOs, as 
discussed in reference (a), procedures are in place at Navy Personnel Command 
(NPC) to expand the eligibility for DAS assignments.  Active promotion and 
advertising of the program has been implemented and NPC is working to further 
incentivize and reward DAS service through statutory promotion board 
precepts.  Additionally, these tours frequently offer language training, 
Foreign Language Proficiency Pay, and Special Duty Assignment Pay for 
enlisted personnel.

6.	For additional information about these exceptional opportunities visit

whichever occurs first.

Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.
