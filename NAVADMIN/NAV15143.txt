RMKS/1.  Per reference (a), this NAVADMIN provides details on the Continuous 
Evaluation Concept Demonstration (CECD) process and establishes response 
requirements for commands receiving CECD reports.  Personnel are reminded of 
their responsibility to self-report potentially derogatory information to 
their Chain of Command and Security Manager as required by chapter 10 of 
reference (b).  Commanders shall report potentially derogatory information to 
the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudication Facility (DODCAF) via the 
Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or successor systems.

2.  CECD uses technology to continuously conduct automated records checks 
using data from government and commercial sources to identify potentially 
derogatory information that may indicate a personnel security concern.

3.  This demonstration continues to evolve with each lesson learned. Under 
the current process, when potentially derogatory information is discovered, a 
report is forwarded directly to the members? Command via the Case 
Adjudication Tracking System (CATS).  The next step in the process is for the 
command to notify the DODCAF of this potentially disqualifying information 
via a JPAS Incident Report. Specifically, command actions include the 
following:
    a.  Within five days, acknowledge command receipt of the CATS message via 
a JPAS Incident Report and include any available amplifying information.
    b.  Assist the individual with the development of a plan of action and 
milestones to address and mitigate the issue.
    c.  Initiate a follow-up report and/or submit a final report to the 
DODCAF to complete the reporting process in JPAS.

4.  It is important for commands to have at least one CATS account and a 
primary and alternate Security Manager because command notification of a 
member flagged for an unreported violation will only occur through CATS.  
Access to CATS is granted through Echelon II Security Managers.

5.  Echelon II commands will ensure subordinate commands obtain and maintain 
CATS access and respond to every CECD alert by submitting a JPAS incident 
report within five days of its receipt.

6.  Commands shall reinforce the requirement for all cleared employees to 
immediately self-report any potentially derogatory information.

7.  Commands that have received CECD reports shall submit lessons learned via 
email to the POC listed in paragraph 9 NLT 15 August 2015.

8.  Reporting requirements contained within this NAVADMIN are exempt from 
Information Management Control Per Secretary of the Navy Manual 5214.1 
December 2005 Part IV Paragraph 7.o.

9.  Point of contact:  CDR Jeremy L. Butler, at: email:
