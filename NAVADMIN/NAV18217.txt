REF/A/DOC/CONGRESS/13AUG18//
AMPN/REF A IS PUBLIC LAW 115-232, JOHN S. MCCAIN NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019.//

RMKS/1.  In line with section 603 of reference (a), the authority to 
prescribe a reduced flat rate per diem for long-term temporary duty has been 
repealed.  Effective 13 August 2018, members on travel over 30 days will 
receive the normal daily per diem rate for the area to which you are 
entitled.  The reduction to 75 or 55 percent of the locality rate is 
terminated.  Reduced flat rate per diem for travel over 30 days will apply 
through midnight on 12 August 2018.  Full per diem applies to any travel 
after 12 August 2018.

2.  Commander, Navy Personnel Command, Pay and Personnel Management 
Department (PERS-2) will release a Pay and Personnel Information Bulletin 
(PPIB) in the near future with further guidance to the fleet.

3.  On the effective date of reference (a), travelers are advised that 
lodging receipts are required for all lodging payments, the actual cost of 
lodging not to exceed the full locality lodging per diem rate will be paid, 
and the full meals and incidental expenses will no longer be reduced by 75 
percent or 55 percent.  Members who have already settled their travel claims 
and were erroneously reimbursed flat per diem for days after 12 August 2018 
are advised to file a supplemental travel claim.

4.  Point of contact for this matter is LCDR Randy Krekeler, N130C, at 
(703) 604-5474/DSN 664 or via e-mail at nxag_n130c(at)navy.mil.
