SUBJ/MILITARY FAMILY APPRECIATION MONTH// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  AS WE PAUSE FOR THE HOLIDAYS, I WOULD LIKE ALL TO 
TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT OUR FAMILIES.  ALL WE DO, WHAT WE 
ACCOMPLISH, AND THAT WHICH WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE ARE GIVEN MEANING AND 
GREAT VALUE BY OUR FAMILIES.  THEY ARE THE FOUNDATION FROM WHICH WE 
DEVELOP, BUILD, AND ENJOY OUR SUCCESSES. 
2.  ALONG WITH SIGNALING THE BEGINNING OF OUR HOLIDAY SEASON, 
NOVEMBER IS NATIONAL MILITARY FAMILY APPRECIATION MONTH.  SINCE THE 
VERY FOUNDING OF OUR NAVY, OUR FAMILIES HAVE PLAYED AN INTEGRAL PART 
AND THERE?S NO BETTER TIME TO THANK THEM.  THEIR SUPPORT, SACRIFICE, 
AND UNFAILING ABILITY TO MANAGE THE INTRICACIES KNOWN ONLY TO NAVY 
FAMILIES ALLOWS OUR NAVY TO ATTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE LEVELS OF 
CAPABILITIES, CAPACITIES, AND READINESS REQUIRED IN OUR WORLD. 
3.  THE WAY NAVY FAMILIES COME TOGETHER WHEN SAILORS DEPLOY ? SHARING 
COLLECTIVE AND INDIVIDUAL SUCCESSES AS WELL AS EXTENDING HELPING 
HANDS IN TIMES OF NEED -- IS TRULY INSPIRATIONAL.  I EXTEND THE 
APPRECIATION OF OUR ENTIRE NAVY, ALONG WITH MY PERSONAL THANKS, TO 
EACH AND EVERY NAVY FAMILY MEMBER WHO SUPPORTS AND STANDS BY THEIR 
SAILOR AND NAVY CIVILIAN THROUGHOUT THEIR NAVY CAREERS AND BEYOND.  
4.  PLEASE JOIN ME THIS MONTH IN CELEBRATING THE MILITARY FAMILY BY 
EXPRESSING, IN OUR WORDS AND ACTIONS, HEARTFELT APPRECIATION FOR ALL 
THEY DO FOR US AND OUR NAVY.  WE ARE SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE THEIR 
SUPPORT. 
5.  WARM REGARDS, ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
