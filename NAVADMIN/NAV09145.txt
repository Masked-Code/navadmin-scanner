GENERATION AND SUSTAINMENT REQUIREMENTS.  CDR ESCOE'S STRATEGIC 
CONTRIBUTIONS, ADVICE, AND MENTORSHIP HAVE ADVANCED LOGISTICS 
TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND PROCESSES IN A NASCENT AND GROWING 
NAVY.  MANY OF HIS EFFORTS HAD AN IMMEDIATE AND REGIONAL EFFECT IN 2008, 
BUT THE MORE ENDURING BENEFIT WILL BE THE U.S. NAVY'S ABILITY TO LEARN 
FROM THESE EXPERIENCES AND PRACTICES TO IMPROVE BUDGET, ACQUISITION AND 
SUPPLY CHAIN MAN  AGEMENT LOGISTICS IN DEVELOPING NAVIES IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST AND GLOBALLY. 
   B.  THE CY2008 CIVILIAN LOGISTICIAN OF THE YEAR IS MR. DAVID RENN,

PROACTIVE DILIGENT WORK PERFORMANCE.  SPECIFICALLY, HE IDENTIFIED AND 
RESOLVED A POTENTIAL SAFETY OF FLIGHT ISSUE WITH THE F404 ENGINE PARTS 
LIFE TRACKING SYSTEM.  HE ALSO WORKED DILIGENTLY TO DEVELOP A MASTER 
PLAN THAT WAS LOGISTICALLY SUPPORTABLE, WHILE ALSO MITIGATING THE RISKS 
ASSOCIATED WITH 1,174 OVER-FLOWN COMPONENTS.  HE ALSO DEVELOPED A 
COMPREHENSIVE 4-YEAR INSPECTION PLAN COVERING 26 DIFFERENT COMPONENT 
PART NUMBERS.  HIS EFFORTS RESULTED IN A COST AVOIDANCE OF OVER $50M

THE MULTI INDENTURED/MULTI ECHELON (MIME) MODELING TECHNIQUE, THE REAL 
ALLOWANCE TEAM SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED BOTH EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS 
OF CVN AVCALS.  THEIR EFFORTS OVER THE PREVIOUS FOUR YEARS CULMINATED 
IN A 13 PERCENT COST SAVINGS PER CVN AVCAL, VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY 
$36.1 MILLION PER SHIP, FOR EACH OF THE SIX CVNS OUTFITTED THROUGHOUT 
2007 AND 2008 (AN AGGREGATE COST SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $216 MILLION).

EXPREPS.  ALL OF THIS WAS ACHIEVED DESPITE A 7 PERCENT INCREASE IN CVN 
OPERATIONAL TEMPO (AS MEASURED IN FLIGHT HOURS).  BY DEVELOPING THE 
CRCS AND CADS AND IMPLEMENTING MILE RBS ENHANCEMENTS, THE RETAIL 
ALLOWANCE TEAM PRODUCED TANGIBLE RESULTS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY
