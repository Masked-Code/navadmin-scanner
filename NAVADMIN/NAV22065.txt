RMKS/1.  The Navy League of the United States (NLUS) will hold its annual Sea 
-Air-Space (SAS) exposition from 4 to 6 April, 2022 with a co-located youth 
STEM exhibition on 3 April, 2022 at the Gaylord National Resort and 
Conference Center, located in National Harbor, MD.  SAS provides a platform 
for the professional development of Department of the Navy personnel on the 
latest developments in naval warfare, as well as an opportunity for Navy 
engagement with representatives from a broad cross-section of government, 
industry, academia, and the international community. 
 
2.  The SAS schedule is designed with a focus on readiness and innovation, 
with panels covering topics such as acquisition, cyber, strategic sealift, 
leadership, shipbuilding, and manpower.  SAS will showcase leaders from 
across the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, other governmental 
agencies and industry.  Additionally, many international delegations will be 
in attendance, including several Heads of Navy (HoN).  A full list of 
speakers and more information on international representation can be found at 
https://seaairspace.org/. 
 
3.  Per reference (a), attendance at non-DoD hosted conferences which have 
historically exceeded $250,000 may require SECNAV/UNSECNAV approval.  SAS 
2022 meets this threshold.  Therefore, requests for attendance shall be 
consolidated by Echelon-2 commands and provided to OPNAV N95 with the number 
of attendees and cost estimates to N95 POC: LCDR Veronica Camiolo, 
veronica.a.camiolo.mil(at)us.navy.mil, to track overall costs and  attendance 
data.  Final conference requests are to be submitted no later than 18 March 
2022.  If no cost is incurred by the government (i.e. people local to area), 
no submission or approval is required.  The following restrictions apply: 
    a.  Subject to command discretion, attendance is authorized for local 
    participants at no cost to the government. 
    b.  SAS 2022 is primarily an East Coast event.  Funded TAD travel from 
West Coast/International commands should be closely examined unless member 
has an active role in the event (sitting on a panel, making an official U.S. 
Navy presentation, etc).  Excessive attendance will be subject to cuts based 
on overall cost. 
    c.  NLUS has offered free attendance at the below ten events to all 
military and civilian personnel.  Because there is a maximum number of seats 
available, attendees are required to pre-register.  Per reference (b), this 
free attendance does not constitute a gift for purposes of applicable ethics 
regulations, and therefore may be accepted by all military and civilian 
personnel.

consult with their ethics counselor for assistance in determining whether 
attendance is permissible. 
    e.  All Navy participation in SAS 2022 shall be consistent with the Joint 
Ethics Regulations found at reference (c).
