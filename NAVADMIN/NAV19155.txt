(AERR).//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Advancement Examination Readiness Review 
(AERR) schedule from October to December 2019.
AERR events provide an opportunity for selected rating subject matter experts 
from Fleet and shore-based commands to impact their respective ratings by 
updating and validating the examination question bank.  Selected chief, 
senior chief and master chief petty officers on Active-Duty, Full-Time 
Support and Reservists currently on Active Duty for Special Work may take 
part in the process.  AERRs enable the Navy to advance the most qualified and 
rating- knowledgeable Sailors.

2.  AERRs are held at Naval Education and Training Professional Development 
Center (NETPDC) Pensacola, FL.  Temporary Duty Travel
(TDY) in support of AERR events is considered mission critical and is flag 
officer approved.  All costs pertaining to TDY are funded by NETPDC.

3.  In line with reference (a), Type Commanders (TYCOM) and rating sponsors 
will recruit rating fleet subject matter experts, select AERR attendees plus 
two alternate members, and provide names and contact information no less than 
45 days prior to the AERR convening date to NETPDC via e-mail at 
sfly_netpdc_aerr(at)navy.mil with a subject line of AERR Selectees.

4.  The following AERRs are scheduled from October through December 2019.  
AERR schedule is in the following format:

Convene Date:               Rating (number of FSMEs required)

6.  In line with reference (b), nomination waivers with accompanying 
justification must be approved by NETPDC prior to TYCOM and rating sponsor 
selections.  To maximize TDY funding, outside continental United States 
waivers must be approved by NETPDC, and require justification by meeting 
specific rating skills, experience or platform/command type not available in 
the continental United States.
