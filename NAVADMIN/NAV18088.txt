NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 203/14, OVERSEAS/REMOTE DUTY SCREENING POLICY CHANGE.  
REF B IS NAVADMIN 159/17 PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION ORDERS LETTER OF 
INTENT.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels references (a) and (b).

2.  With increased orders lead time (OLT), letters of intent (LOI) are no 
longer as impactful and less critical for Sailors and their dependents.  OLT 
is expected to remain around six months in aggregate for the foreseeable 
future, with a shift in the CMS-ID window to 9-12 months.  Sailors should 
receive orders with adequate time to complete the required documentation and 
logistical planning for both continental United States (CONUS) and 
overseas/remote assignments before beginning the permanent change of station 
(PCS) process, negating the need for the LOI.

3.  The other PCS tools that were available as outlined in reference (a) 
remain in effect to make the PCS process smooth for Sailors and their 
dependents.

4.  Naval Personnel Command (NPC) will resume issuance of LOIs as necessary 
to best meet Sailor needs, based upon budgetary constraints, OLT, and other 
factors as determined by NPC leadership.

5.  For assistance or further information, contact the NPC Help Desk at 
(866) 827-5672/DSN 882 or via e-mail at: uasknpc(at)navy.mil.
