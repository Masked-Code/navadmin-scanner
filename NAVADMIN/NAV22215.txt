RMKS/1.  This message announces the Navy's education opportunities through 
the Center of Excellence in Logistics and Technology (LOGTECH) Institute for 
Defense and Business, University of North Carolina (UNC) during fiscal year

throughout their organizations.  Since 2001, LOGTECH has brought together key 
military officials from the Department of Defense (DoD), U.S. government 
executives, academic thought leaders, and senior private sector participants

and business practices.  Partnering with the Kenan-Flagler Business School at 
UNC-Chapel Hill, LOGTECH offers two distinct education programs for military, 
DoD, and private sector personnel: 
     a. LOGTECH Executive Course.  This program is designed for military Flag
