10.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a promotion selection board 
via the Letter to the Board (LTB) process.  NAVADMIN 220/19 announced the 
introduction of a new application known as Electronic Submission of Selection 
Board Documents (ESSBD), accessible through MyNavy Portal (MNP).  ESSBD 
improves the speed, transparency, and confidence of receipt over current LTB 
submission methods, such as hard copy and e-mail submitted letters and 
related attachments. 
    a.  ESSBD will be available for all promotion, advancement and selection 
boards. 
    b.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to electronically 
submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without attachments, 
and will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) exactly what 
will be delivered and presented to the board. 
    c.  To use ESSBD, candidates must access document services through MNP 
at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record.  On-screen instructions will 
direct the submitter thereafter. 
    d.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted.  If required, a full visual user 
guide is available athttps://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-
promotion. 
    e.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command not later than 2359 
(central time) 10 days prior to the convening date of the respective 
board.  Submitters are cautioned to not wait until the deadline date to 
submit LTBs via ESSBD or other available avenues. 
Selection To               Convening Date     Due Date / Time 
Rear Admiral               25 SEP 23          14 SEP 23 / 2359 CST 
Rear Admiral (lower half)  26 SEP 23          15 SEP 23 / 2359 CST 
    f.  If having problems submitting board packages via ESSBD 
(network connectivity, system maintenance, etc.) or if sending a board 
package from a non-NMCI network (bumed.mil, eu.navy.mil, etc.), please review 
procedures listed in NAVADMIN 220/19 and MILPERSMAN 1420-010 for alternative 
submission methods. 
    g.  The written communication may call attention to the board any matter 
concerning the record of the officer that the officer considers 
important.  Written communication may include, as enclosures, correspondence 
from any individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not 
originated by the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of 
the eligible officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must 
contain a written acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she 
desires such correspondence be presented to the board. 
Correspondence without such an acknowledgement is considered third-party 
correspondence and will be returned without being presented to the 
board.  Classified correspondence will not be accepted.  All officers are 
reminded it is their responsibility to ensure their personnel records are 
substantially accurate and complete. 
 
11.  Merit reorder will not be authorized for the subject boards.
