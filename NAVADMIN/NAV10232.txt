SUBJ/PUBLIC-PRIVATE VENTURE RESIDENT ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM//

RMKS/1. THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RESIDENT 
ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM (RECP) PILOT IN PUBLIC-PRIVATE VENTURE (PPV) 
HOUSING AT NAVY AND MARINE CORPS BASES IN HAWAII BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER 
2010.

2. OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS, OUR PPV HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN 
ELIMINATING INADEQUATE NAVY FAMILY HOUSING. HISTORICAL DATA SHOWS, 
HOWEVER, THAT PPV RESIDENTS USE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ELECTRICITY PER DAY 
THAN RESIDENTS IN THE COMMUNITY LIVING IN COMPARABLE HOMES.

3. IN 1998, THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (OSD) ESTABLISHED 
POLICY FOR THE PAYMENT OF UTILITIES IN PRIVATIZED FAMILY HOUSING TO 
ENCOURAGE A REDUCTION IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION. THE RECP REPRESENTS THE 
NAVY'S NEXT STEP IN ESTABLISHING AN ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM IN PPV 
HOUSING CONSISTENT WITH OSD POLICY. THE RECP IS DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE 
ENERGY CONSERVATION BY IDENTIFYING THOSE THAT USE "EXCESS" UTILITIES 
AND ENSURING THE SAVINGS ARE USED TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY 
AND BENEFITS TO THE PPV NEIGHBORHOODS, RESULTING IN IMPROVED QUALITY OF 
LIFE FOR OUR MILITARY RESIDENTS.

4. THE RECP PILOT WILL HAVE THREE PHASES. THE EDUCATION AND 
COMMUNICATION PHASE BEGINS WITH THE RELEASE OF THIS MESSAGE. THE MOCK 
BILLING PHASE WILL START ON 1 SEPTEMBER 2010, AND THE LIVE BILLING 
PHASE WILL BEGIN 1 JANUARY 2011. AFTER ONE YEAR, WE WILL EVALUATE THE 
PILOT TO DETERMINE PROGRAM APPLICABILITY TO OTHER PROJECTS OR AS AN 
ENTERPRISE-WIDE SOLUTION TO MANAGING PPV HOUSING ENERGY CONSUMPTION.

5. RESIDENTS IN HAWAII WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE INFORMATION VIA THE 
REGION WEBSITE: HTTP://WWW.GREATLIFEHAWAII.COM/RECP/ AS WELL AS THE PPV 
PARTNER'S WEBSITE: HTTP://WWW.FCNAVYHAWAII.COM.
