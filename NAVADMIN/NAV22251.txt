results under this label in PRIMS-2 and retain official body composition 
assessment and physical readiness test score sheets for five years in line 
with reference (a).  CFL and ACFLs are reminded to log into their PRIMS-2 
account every 30 days to keep their account from being deactivated.

through MyNavy Portal, My Records and will electronically submit their

charge are encouraged to use incentive programs for the physical readiness 
program (special liberty, award certificates, etc.).
    d.  Fitness Report and Evaluation Guidance.  In line with reference (d), 
commands should enter a 1-letter code indicating the result of each official 
PFA conducted during the reporting period in block 20.  Format for block 20
