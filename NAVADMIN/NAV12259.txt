SUBJ/SUICIDE PREVENTION AWARENESS MONTH//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES SEPTEMBER AS NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION 
AWARENESS MONTH.  THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAS CHARGED LEADERSHIP WITH THE 
RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE THIS ISSUE HEAD ON.  OUR NAVY'S SUICIDE PREVENTION 
EFFORTS MUST BE AN ALL HANDS EVOLUTION - ALL OF THE TIME.  LEADERS NEED TO BE 
ENGAGED BECAUSE PREVENTION DEPENDS ON LEADERSHIP.

2.  OUR PEOPLE ARE OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSET.  PROMOTING A LIFESTYLE OF TOTAL 
FITNESS - PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY, SOCIALLY AND SPIRITUALLY - REINFORCES THE 
SECRETARY OF THE NAVY'S 21ST CENTURY SAILOR AND MARINE INITIATIVE AND SUPPORTS 
THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATION'S SAILING DIRECTIONS.  SUPPORTING A LIFESTYLE OF 
TOTAL FITNESS WILL KEEP US ON A COURSE TO PREVENTING SUICIDES.

3.  THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER WILL SEE US CONTINUING OUR EFFORTS TO PREVENT OUR 
SAILORS FROM MAKING SUICIDE A CHOICE TO RELIEVE THE PAIN FROM STRESS, 
CHALLENGES AND DIFFICULTIES THEY MAY BE FACING.
TO FACILITATE RAISING OUR COLLECTIVE AWARENESS, MULTIPLE SUICIDE PREVENTION 
TOOLS AND RESOURCES WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR COMMANDS TO USE IN THEIR 
AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS.  THE FOLLOWING WEEKLY AWARENESS CONCEPTS ARE PROVIDED AND 
WILL BE USED THROUGHOUT THE MONTH TO GUIDE AWARENESS DISCUSSIONS AND MESSAGE
DELIVERY:
    A.  WEEK 1:  BUILDING RESILIENCE
    B.  WEEK 2:  NAVIGATING STRESS
    C.  WEEK 3:  ENCOURAGING BYSTANDER INTERVENTION TO A-C-T
    D.  WEEK 4:  REDUCING BARRIERS FOR SEEKING SUPPORT THROUGH COUNSELING

4.  THIS WEEK, COMMAND SUICIDE PREVENTION COORDINATORS WILL BE SUPPLIED TOOLS 
AND RESOURCES FOR COMMAND USE, THESE INCLUDE FACT SHEETS FOR INCORPORATION 
INTO COMMAND TRAINING SESSIONS, DAILY PLAN OF THE DAY NOTES, BULLETINS FOR 
POSTING ON COMMAND BULLETIN BOARDS, AND AN INDIVIDUAL STRESS NAVIGATION PLAN 
FOR USE BY COMMAND LEADERSHIP AND SUICIDE PREVENTION COORDINATORS DURING GROUP 
AND INDIVIDUAL TRAINING SESSIONS.  THESE TOOLS AND RESOURCES SUPPORT THE FOUR 
CONCEPTS ABOVE AND MAY BE VIEWED AT WWW.SUICIDE.NAVY.MIL AND 
WWW.NAVYNAVSTRESS.COM.  CONTAINED WITHIN THESE PRODUCTS ARE MESSAGES THAT HAVE 
BEEN TAILORED TO EMPHASIZE POSITIVE THEMES OF DEDICATION, OPTIMISM, 
DETERMINATION, AND HUMOR.  THESE THEMES SHOULD HELP OUR SAILORS HONE THEIR 
ABILITIES TO THRIVE IN LIFE, NOT JUST SURVIVE.

5.  ON 28 SEPTEMBER 2012, THE WINNING ENTRY FROM THE SUICIDE PREVENTION PUBLIC 
SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT CONTEST (SPPSAC) WILL BE ANNOUNCED.  THE WINNING VIDEO 
WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR VIEWING ONLINE AND BROADCASTED REGULARLY ON DIRECT-TO-
SAILOR TELEVISION, THE AMERICAN FORCES NETWORK AND PENTAGON CHANNEL.

6.  WE ARE THE WORLD'S GREATEST NAVY AND TOGETHER WE CAN BUILD STRENGTH AND 
RESILIENCE IN THOSE ON OUR TEAM.  WE MUST ALL ENCOURAGE COUNSELING AS A VIABLE 
RESOURCE TO HELP NAVIGATE STRESS AND TO REMAIN MISSION READY.
