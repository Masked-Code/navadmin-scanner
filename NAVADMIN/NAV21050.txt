RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 Navy 
Active-Duty and Navy Reserve Enlisted Advancement Selection Boards for Chief 
Petty Officer.  The Active Component (AC)/Full-Time Support (FTS) cycle is 
250, and the Selected Reserve (SELRES) cycle is 108.  The Reserve Component 
(RC) board will consider personnel serving on Active-Duty as FTS and SELRES, 
to include those serving on voluntary and involuntary recall and mobilization 
orders.  Mobilized Individual Ready Reserve and Canvasser Recruiter personnel 
are considered under the SELRES requirements for advancement.  This is a 
change from policy in reference (a). 
 
2.  RC Timeline 
    a.  28 February 2021:  Individual augmentation evaluations used for time-
in-rate (TIR) waivers must have an ending date by this date and must be 
available to the board. 
    b.  12 June 2021:  RC candidates changing ratings must be in their new 
rating by this date to be considered for selection in the new rating. 
    c.  28 June 2021:  Letter to the board (LTB) deadline for the RC E-7 
selection board. 
    d.  12 July 2021:  RC E-7 selection board convenes.  All eligibility 
requirements, to include any waivers, must have final approval and be posted 
to the records of the candidates prior to this date. 
    e.  30 July 2021:  RC E-7 selection board scheduled to adjourn. 
 
3.  AC Timeline 
    a.  28 February 2021:  Individual augmentation evaluations used for TIR 
waivers must have an ending date by this date and must be available to the 
board. 
    b.  9 July 2021:  AC board candidates changing ratings must be in their

    c.  26 July 2021:  LTB deadline to the AC E-7 selection board. 
    d.  9 August 2021:  AC E-7 selection board convenes.  All eligibility

4.  Eligibility Criteria.  Candidates must meet the eligibility requirements 
outlined in chapters 2 and 11 of reference (a) and this NAVADMIN prior to the 
scheduled board convening date.  All requirements must be reflected in the 
enlisted master file prior to the board convening.  Requirements achieved or 
posted to the record of the candidates after the scheduled board convening 
date will be considered late and do not make a candidate eligible for the 
regularly scheduled board or entitle a candidate to a special selection 
board.  If candidates are deemed ineligible for advancement and invalidated 
in Navy Enlisted Advancement System (NEAS), but later regain eligibility, 
submit a message formatted e-mail to Naval Education Training Professional 
Development Center (NETPDC)(N321) and Selection Board Eligibility Branch 
(PERS 802) requesting validation of eligibility status and provide an 
explanation.  Eligibility requirements include: 
    a.  The name of the candidate appears on the selection board eligibility 
list in the correct competitive group on their profile sheet.  Candidates 
should register for e-mail notification for profile sheet updates via MyNavy 
Portal (MNP) at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-advancement-center/my- 
advancement.  Candidates and commands share equal responsibility to ensure 
the eligibility list is accurate.  Because eligibility status can change 
without direct notification, candidates should verify their profile sheet on 
a continuous basis.  Commands must verify their examination status 
verification reports weekly through the projected board adjourn date at the 
NEAS website via MNP at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-advancement-
center/my-eso. 
    b.  TIR date must be on or before 1 January 2019.  In line with reference 
(a), the terminal eligibility date used to compute TIR is 1 January 2022.  If 
an early promote (EP) TIR waiver is granted, the evaluation used to grant the 
EP TIR waiver must be available to the board. 
    c.  High year tenure (HYT) waivers must be approved prior to the board 
convening.  HYT date or approved HYT waivers for the current paygrade must be 
dated 1 September 2021 or later.  Candidates who will be at HYT on 1 
September 2021 for the next higher paygrade are ineligible for advancement, 
regardless of any approved HYT waiver. 
    d.  Commands must revalidate members whose disapproved or canceled 
retirement authorization is adjudicated prior to selection board convening 
date by sending an e-mail with a reason for revalidation to PERS-802.  See 
paragraph 208 of reference (a) for fleet reserve request impacts to 
eligibility. 
    e.  Security clearance requirements.  See paragraph 203 of reference 
(a).  Ratings requiring a security clearance are AC, AE, AG, AO, AT, AWF, 
AWO, AWR, AWS, AWV, AZ, CTI, CTM, CTN, CTR, CTT, EOD, ET, FC, FCA, GM, HT, 
IC, IS, IT, LN, MA, MC, MN, ND, OS, QM, SB, SO, STG and YN, as well as all 
nuclear and submarine ratings. 
    f.  Rating specific and competitive group eligibility 
requirements.  Candidates must meet special requirements for certain ratings, 
as outlined in paragraphs 203 and 206 of reference (a). Required Navy 
enlisted classifications (NEC) must be posted in the enlisted master file 
prior to the regularly scheduled board convening date.  NECs posted to the 
enlisted master file after the regularly scheduled board convening date, even 
with a prior date, will not entitle a candidate to a special selection 
board.  Commands must verify and submit a message formatted e-mail to NETPDC 
(N321) and PERS-802 requesting invalidation of those selection board eligible 
candidates who no longer meet rate specific and competitive group 
qualifications listed in reference (a) or below by the scheduled board 
convening date. 
        (1) Nuclear trained Sailors must hold additional NEC N33Z to indicate 
Engineering Watch Supervisor (EWS)/Propulsion Plant Watch Supervisor (PPWS) 
qualification per reference (b). 
        (2) Non-nuclear trained submarine Sailors must be designated as 
either SS, SU or SQ in line with reference (c) as of the board convening date 
to be eligible.  Candidates designated as SG or SP are not eligible for 
advancement. 
 
5.  Record review and communication with the E-7 selection board refer to 
reference (d). 
    a.  Communication to the board must originate from the individual 
candidate and must be accompanied under the signed LTB of the candidate. 
    b.  All LTBs and each enclosure must contain the candidates full name and 
10-digit DoD identification number.  Candidates must verify that the correct 
board number is on their signed cover letter.  Board numbers are: 
        (1) 335 for SELRES. 
        (2) 336 for FTS. 
        (3) 360 for AC. 
    c.  Electronic submission of selection board documents (ESSBD) is the 
preferred method to submit an LTB as directed by reference (d).  Candidates 
may access ESSBD via MNP at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-
promotion.  After login and navigating to the Advancement and Promotion 
webpage, select the *ESSBD* tile link. 
    d.  If unable to submit a LTB package using ESSBD (e.g. low bandwidth, 
system outage, etc.) candidates should review procedures in reference (d) to 
submit via alternate methods or candidates may mail a LTB to the addresses 
below.  Mailed LTBs should be on plain white paper and paper clipped (no 
staples, binders, folders or tabs).
