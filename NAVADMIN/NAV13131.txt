RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the 2012 Navy (non-career) Linguists; Command 
Language Program and Language Professionals.

language skills as key operational enablers.  Having considered all entries, 
it is my distinct pleasure to announce Navy's 2012 award
winners:

(NIOC) Georgia.

Warfare Group 10.

3.  It is important to recognize the role which Language, Regional Expertise, 
and Culture (LREC) play in modern Naval Operations.  In today's operational 
environment, LREC is central to everything from Humanitarian Operations to 
building lasting relationships with foreign partners.  LREC's importance is no 
more evident than reviewing the contributions of the winners listed above as 
well as those of their competition.

4.  I extend my sincere appreciation for the continuing support of these vital 
Navy language programs and outstanding Sailors.  To our award winners, thank 
you for your ongoing dedication and professionalism.
