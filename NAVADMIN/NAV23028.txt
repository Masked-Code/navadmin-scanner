SERVICE PROCUREMENT PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION OF 26 JANUARY 2023.
REF B IS OPNAVINST 1420.1B, ENLISTED TO OFFICER COMMISSIONING PROGRAMS 
APPLICATION ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Training and Administration of the 
Reserve (TAR) Officer In-service Procurement Program (TAR ISPP) and solicits 
applications from qualified enlisted Sailors.  This program will send 
qualifying enlisted Sailors directly to Officer Candidate School (OCS) to 
commission as a TAR officer.  Applications will be accepted for all TAR 
designators based on community management quota determinations.

2.  This program is open to TAR enlisted Sailors possessing a baccalaureate 
degree who have completed at least 6 months of time in service and their 
initial training pipeline.

3.  Application procedures and education requirements are outlined in this 
NAVADMIN and references (a) and (b).

4.  As delineated in reference (a), applicants must meet the prescribed 
qualifications in line with this program and the program authorization (PA) 
of the designator for which they are applying.

5.  Selection process:
    a.  Nominations will occur at the commanding officer (CO) level with 
endorsement by the immediate superior in command (ISIC).
Nominations from the initial training pipeline will not be accepted.
The nominating CO and ISIC do not need to be a TAR officer.
Applicants must be favorably nominated using the COs recommendation section 
in the officer programs application, OPNAV 1420/1.  The COs endorsement must 
contain:
        (1) a statement indicating that the applicant is serving on full duty 
without limitation,
        (2) a statement that the applicant meets physical fitness and body 
fat percentage standards, and
        (3) a statement addressing any adverse performance evaluation data as 
well as positive steps taken by the applicant to address these performance 
issues.
    b.  COs should ensure all portions are completed and that the applicant 
meets all TAR ISPP and designator-specific eligibility criteria.
    c.  COs will then forward nominations to their ISIC for endorsement.
    d.  The ISIC, if in concurrence, will forward nominations and endorsement 
to Officer Definite Recall Program (PERS-92).
    e.  PERS-92 will review all nominations to ensure that TAR ISPP and 
individual PA requirements are met.  PERS-92 will reject any nomination that 
is incomplete, ineligible, or if the applicant requested designator is closed 
due to unavailable quotas.  In such cases, PERS-92 will return nominations to 
the originating command and the ISIC will be notified of the discrepancy 
which prevented further processing.
    f.  PERS-92 will forward complete nomination packages to Reserve 
Community Management (BUPERS-35) for consideration at TAR ISPP selection 
panels.  Selection panels will be held at least semi- annually or in 
conjunction with scheduled TAR transfer and re- designation boards.
    g. Following the TAR ISPP selection panel, PERS-92 will notify COs and 
applicants of the results and ensure selectees are processed to attend OCS at 
the earliest opportunity.

6.  Additional requirements:
    a.  Applicants must be of good moral character and have no record of 
disciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 15, 
no court-martial convictions, and no civilian felony convictions by any civil 
court or misdemeanors (except minor
($300 or less fine) traffic violations) within the three years preceding 
selection.  An offense involving driving under the influence of an intoxicant 
(driving under the influence or driving while intoxicated, etc.) is a major 
traffic violation and is disqualifying if within 4 years the preceding 
selection date.  Any substantiated in-service drug use or in-service alcohol 
abuse (any record of either, regardless of date) will result in 
disqualification.
    b.  To ensure applicants are ready for OCS physical fitness requirements, 
applicants must have passed their most recent physical fitness assessment 
(PFA) with an overall score of at least *excellent*.  If no official physical 
readiness test scores are available, a mock PFA will suffice provided it is 
administered by a qualified command fitness leader.  The run option is the 
preferred cardio option for the PFA.
    c.  Applicants must have a minimum of 6 months of time in service in 
order to apply.
    d.  There is no requirement for an applicant to have achieved their 
warfare qualification.  Not having a warfare qualification will not be viewed 
adversely by the TAR ISPP selection board.

7.  No waivers are authorized for TAR ISPP.

8.  Due to the nature of the selection process, applicants and their commands 
will be contacted directly by PERS-92 for notification of results.  Once 
notifications are complete, TAR ISPP results will be released on the TAR 
transfer/re-designation website.

9.  PAs can be found by going to the MyNavy HR website
(https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/) and clicking on career management, then 
community management, then officer community.

10.  Points of contact:
    a.  TAR ISPP program questions, please contact LCDR Sidney Larson, 
Division Director, PERS-92 at (901) 874-4512 or 
sidney.e.larson.mil(at)us.navy.mil.

Community Manager (BUPERS-351) at (901) 874-4346 or

11.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until 30 December 2024 or when 
superseded.
