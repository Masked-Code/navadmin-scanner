RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the disestablishment of the Full-Time 
Support (FTS) culinary specialist (CS) rating.  This disestablishment applies 
to only FTS CS and supports the FTS rebalance initiative set forth by Chief 
of Navy Reserve (CNR).  An in depth community health and billet review 
revealed the majority of FTS CS billets do not support the FTS mission, 
solidifying the decision to disestablish the FTS CS rating.  Additionally, 
the disestablishment allows for alignment with CNRs strategic priorities, 
while increasing readiness as defined in references (a) and (b). 
 
2.  FTS CS rating disestablishment.  The disestablishment of the FTS CS 
general service rating will be effective 1 February 2021.  This rating 
disestablishment applies to FTS only and does not affect Active Component 
(AC), Selected Reserve (SELRES) or Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) CS 
Sailors.  An extensive review of advancement opportunity, career diversity 
and Fleet requirements for the FTS CS rating concluded that the rating does 
not allow for healthy career progression and is no longer sustainable. 
 
3.  Rating disestablishment actions required.  FTS CS Sailors have several 
options for future service and must request an option to be approved for 
conversion to another AC or FTS rating no later than 1 December 2020.  FTS CS 
Sailors are strongly encouraged to transition to AC CS.  For Sailors in 
paygrades E-1 through E-6 with under 14 years of service electing to convert 
to another FTS rating to remain FTS, commands will submit career waypoints 
(C-WAY) applications as soon as possible in order to maximize the opportunity 
for receipt of a C-WAY conversion quota prior to 1 December 2020.  Sailors 
who are currently C-WAY final denied or become C-WAY final denied prior to 
January 2021 will be separated at their current expiration of active 
obligated service (EAOS).  Commands are advised to conduct career development 
boards with Sailors affected by this NAVADMIN in order to fully review all 
career options. 
    a.  FTS CS Sailors in paygrades E-6 and below who will have less than 14 
years of total service prior to EAOS have the following options: 
        (1) Remain in the CS rating and reenlist into the AC upon approval of 
conversion via C-WAY.  C-WAY approval must be granted to execute an AC 
reenlistment obligation, which must equal or exceed remaining service on 
current reserve enlistment. 
        (2) Remain FTS and convert to a community that has convert-in quotas 
via C-WAY.  Sailors who desire to convert to another FTS rating must apply 
and be approved based on the December 2020 C-WAY submission cycle. 
        (3) If at EAOS or eligible for early separation, apply for 
SELRES option via C-WAY. 
    b.  FTS Sailors who will have more than 14 years of total service at EAOS 
or who are E-7 and above, regardless of years of service, have the following 
options: 
        (1) Remain FTS and convert to a rating that has conversion 
opportunity, since personnel above 14 years of service do not participate in 
C-WAY, members must contact the FTS community manager for conversion 
options.  Sailors who desire to convert to another FTS rating must be 
approved by 1 January 2021.  If not approved, Sailors must choose another 
option. 
        (2) Remain in the CS rating and reenlist into the AC.  The 
reenlistment obligation must equal or exceed remaining service on current 
reserve enlistment. 
        (3) If eligible, FTS CS Sailors with 18 or more years of service 
(YOS), but less than 20 YOS, who request transfer to the Fleet Reserve will 
be permitted to do so in rate, not to exceed 20 years of service. 
        (4) If eligible, FTS CS Sailors with 20 or more YOS, who do not 
desire to convert to another FTS Rating or reenlist into the AC, must submit 
their request to transfer to the Fleet Reserve no later than 31 January 2021. 
These Sailors are not authorized to reenlistment or extend without Reserve 
Community Manager (BUPERS-35) approval. 
 
4.  Reenlistments because of these actions are authorized outside of the 
timeframes established in reference (c).  All Sailors approved for AC 
conversion, must reenlist prior to 31 January 2021 in the AC to finalize the 
conversion process. 
 
5.  All Sailors selected for rating conversion must convert uniform rating 
badges to the appropriate rating badge upon rating conversion approval or no 
later than the effective date of the FTS CS rating disestablishment. 
 
6.  Advancement exam and promotion board adjustments. 
    a.  Navy-wide advancement exam administration schedule: 
        (1)  E-7 (FTS):  no pending exams prior to rating disestablishment. 
        (2)  E-4 through E-6 (FTS):  last exam cycle prior to 
disestablishment - September 2020 (cycle 248).  E-4 through E-6 Sailors 
selected for advancement in cycle 248 (September 2020) who are selected for 
conversion to AC CS, will be advanced to the higher paygrade once their 
conversion is approved.  FTS E-4 through E-6 Sailors selected for advancement 
in cycle 248 (September 2020), who are converted to another FTS rating must 
submit an advancement determination request to Navy Personnel Command, 
Enlisted Advancement Branch (PERS-8031) at advancements-active(at)navy.mil, 
requesting advancement to the next paygrade in the new rating. 
    b.  E-7 and E-8/E-9 selection board schedule: 
        (1)  E-8/E-9 (FTS):  no remaining boards held prior to rating 
disestablishment. 
        (2)  E-7 (FTS):  The last board prior to disestablishment - September 
2020 Fiscal Year-21 (cycle 246).  Sailors selected for advancement to Chief 
Petty Officer must submit an advancement determination request to Navy 
Personnel Command, Enlisted Advancement Branch (PERS-8031) at advancements-
active(at)navy.mil, requesting advancement to the next paygrade in the new 
rating. 
 
7.  Based on the FTS CS rating disestablishment, effective 1 February 2021, 
all Sailors who converted to the AC will be detailed by the AC CS 
detailers.  All Sailors converted to another FTS rating will be detailed by 
their newly assigned rating detailer.  Once final enlisted community managers 
conversion decisions are published, FTS Sailors who have or will convert, and 
are in receipt of permanent change of station orders but have not transferred 
to their new duty station, must contact their detailer before executing 
orders.  Every effort will be made to maintain current projected rotation 
dates for FTS CS Sailors who reenlist in the AC as a CS. However, if the 
Sailor is in a billet that no longer matches their rating, they may receive 
new orders that meet Fleet requirements in their newly assigned rating. 
 
8.  This NAVADMIN does not modify any previous guidance concerning Fleet 
reserve or conversion package submissions.  Sailors will compete in C-WAY for 
a new rate per established C-WAY policy.  Once a Sailor is converted, they 
will retain their C-WAY quota for conversion and reenlistment in their new 
rate. 
 
9.  Points of contact are as follows: 
    a.  Reserve Enlisted Community Manager (BUPERS-352), CDR Joshua Lipps at 
(901) 874-4511/DSN 882, or via e-mail at joshua.lipps(at)navy.mil.
