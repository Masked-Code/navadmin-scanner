SUBJ/2008 DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. HOLIDAY OBSERVANCE// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. 
OBSERVANCE TO BE HELD 21 JANUARY 2008.  THE THEME FOR THIS YEAR?S 
OBSERVANCE IS ?REMEMBER! CELEBRATE! ACT! A DAY ON, NOT A DAY OFF!? 
2.  DR. KING ENVISIONED A UNITED AMERICA CREATED THROUGH 
NON-VIOLENT SOCIAL CHANGE.  HE MOTIVATED HIS FELLOW CITIZENS 
THROUGH MASTERY OF THE SPOKEN WORD AND WILLINGNESS TO SACRIFICE 
ON BEHALF OF OTHERS.  HIS COMMITMENT TO CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
EVENTUALLY COST HIM HIS OWN LIFE.  DR. KING?S LEGACY NOW LIVES ON 
THROUGH THIS NATIONAL OBSERVANCE AND OUR COMMITMENT TO LIVE BY 
THE PRINCIPLES HE ESPOUSED. 
3.  IN A SERMON DELIVERED ON 4 FEBRUARY 1968, DR. KING SAID, 
?IF ANY OF YOU ARE AROUND WHEN I HAVE TO MEET MY DAY, I DON?T 
WANT A LONG FUNERAL.  AND IF YOU GET SOMEBODY TO DELIVER THE 
EULOGY, TELL THEM NOT TO TALK TOO LONG... TELL THEM NOT TO 
MENTION THAT I HAVE A NOBEL PRIZE.  THAT ISN?T IMPORTANT.  
TELL THEM NOT TO MENTION THAT I HAVE THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED 
OTHER AWARDS.  THAT?S NOT IMPORTANT... I WANT 
YOU TO SAY THAT I TRIED TO LOVE AND SERVE HUMANITY.?  
4.  ALL COMMANDS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO INCREASE THEIR 
KNOWLEDGE AND AWARENESS OF DR. KING?S ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND HIS 
ENDURING LEGACY. PROGRAMS, EXHIBITS, PUBLICATIONS, AND 
PARTICIPATION IN MILITARY AND COMMUNITY EVENTS RECOGNIZING 
THE DIVERSITY OF OUR AMERICAN HERITAGE 
ARE EXCELLENT WAYS TO DEEPEN OUR COMMITMENT TO THAT LEGACY. 
5.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR. KING, AS
