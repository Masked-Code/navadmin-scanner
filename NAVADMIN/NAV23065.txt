RMKS/1.  References (a) through (g) rescinded the Navy's COVID-19 
vaccine mandate.  COVID-19 vaccination is no longer required for 
Navy Service members, and refusing the COVID-19 vaccine is no longer 
a basis for separation from the Navy. 
 
2.  Reference (d) ended administrative separations based solely on 
COVID-19 vaccine refusal.  Separation processing may continue in 
cases where there are other reasons for separation. 
 
3.  In line with reference (e), COVID-19 vaccination status shall 
not be a consideration in assessing individual Service member 
suitability for deployment or other operational assignments.  Navy 
Service members who are unvaccinated against COVID-19 and are 
approaching, in, or past their assignment window should contact 
their detailer if not already being processed for their next 
assignment. 
 
4.  Reference (b) directed the military services to cease processing 
requests and appeals seeking religious accommodation from the COVID- 
19 vaccine.  Such requests and appeals by Navy Service 
members are now closed and are considered returned without action. 
Navy Service members who submitted requests or appeals seeking 
relief from other mandatory vaccinations along with a COVID-19 
vaccine request that have not yet been adjudicated will be contacted 
individually in line with reference (g). 
 
5.  In line with reference (g), the records of currently serving 
Navy Service members who requested religious accommodation from 
COVID-19 vaccination are being centrally reviewed to identify and 
remove any adverse information related to vaccine refusal, should it 
exist.  Other current and former Navy service members 
may petition the Board for Corrections of Naval Records regarding 
COVID-19 vaccination related matters. 
 
6.  In line with reference (g), selection board precepts will 
include language that precludes consideration of adverse 
information regarding COVID-19 vaccine refusal in the case 
of Service members who submitted religious accommodation requests.
