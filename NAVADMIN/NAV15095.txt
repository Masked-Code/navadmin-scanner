RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN is a planning order (PLANORD) for events in support of 
the commemoration of the 240th U.S. Navy Birthday and Heritage week (240 
BDAY).  Coordination and Planning is directed to support working group 
planning, operation order (OPORDER) development and execution of 240 BDAY 
commemorations Navy-wide.

2.  Situation:
    a.  On 13 October 2015, the Navy will celebrate its 240th birthday.
The central theme of this year's 240 BDAY and Heritage Week will be
"Ready Then, Ready Now, Ready Always." The announcement of this theme now 
allows planners at all echelons to focus talking points, guest speaker 
solicitations, etc. for this year's commemorations.  On 5 October 2015, the 
Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) will mark the commencement of a week-long 
Navy Heritage celebration in Washington, DC culminating with a commemoration 
at the National Capital Region (NCR) Navy Birthday Ball on 10 October 2015.
    b.  The Navy will leverage the 240 BDAY as an opportunity for enhanced 
public engagement, both at home and where our forces are stationed abroad.  
Per reference (b), the continued development of an overarching strategic 
approach will ensure alignment throughout the Navy enterprise and provide 
guidance for planning and execution. The intent is to maximize public 
awareness by conducting local events in areas with a Navy presence.  On a 
broader scale, we will use the 240 BDAY to tell our Navy's story, strengthen 
our Navy's connection to the American public, and improve the American 
public's appreciation for our Navy's role in our Nation's history and 
culture.
    c.  The 240 BDAY commemorations will include a series of events in fleet 
concentration areas (CONUS and OCONUS) and at local commands throughout the 
Navy concluding, by 13 October 2015.  240 BDAY planning should include a 
range of events coordinated to promote participation by the local populace 
and civic leadership per references (a) through (e).
    d.  The Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) is planning to 
conduct Navy Leadership Flag Officer Forums during the week of 5-10 October 
2015 to coincide with 240 BDAY events throughout the NCR, thereby maximizing 
senior Navy leadership ability to participate. Additional information will be 
provided via separate correspondence (SEPCOR).
    e.  The 239 BDAY effort was divided into two phases:  phase I was 
planning and program development; and Phase II was the execution of the 239 
BDAY plan concluding 13 October 2014.  This PLANORD directs incorporation of 
an additional phase for the 240 BDAY; Phase III is assessment and plan 
refinement (14 October 2015 to 31 March 2016). This phase encompasses the 
assessment of the effectiveness of the 240 BDAY activities vs. planned 
effects, and the refinement of processes to further maximize Navy-wide 
actions.  This phase will begin immediately after the 240 BDAY.  Phase I is 
the planning/program development of 240 BDAY (1 April 2015 - 1 September 
2015).  This phase encompasses the detailed planning required to execute 240 
BDAY events.  Phase II is the execution of the 240 BDAY (2 September 2015 - 
13 October 2015) plan.  This will begin upon the release of the 240 BDAY 
EXORD by Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command (COMUSFLTFORCOM).   Phase III 
is the assessment and plan refinement phase of the 240 BDAY and will occur 
from 14 October 2015 to 31 March 2016.
    f.  COMUSFLTFORCOM is the lead for all phases and may provide amplifying 
guidance, to include delegating authority to other echelon II and below 
commands to lead specific phases or provide support with the exception of 
efforts aligned to support NCR events.  In every case, all events will be 
synchronized with NCR events.  For optimal sequencing, all Navy Birthday 
Ceremonies (including those associated with Navy Birthday Balls) should, to 
the maximum extent possible, be planned to execute prior to the NCR Navy 
Birthday Ball on 10 October 2015.

3.  Mission:  Navy commands will synchronize their efforts in celebrating the 
U.S. Navy's birthday each year to gain the maximum institutional benefits for 
internal and external audiences.  For the purpose of the effort, 
institutional benefit includes:
    a.  Increased awareness and support for the U.S. Navy.
    b.  Enhanced appreciation of Navy missions, history and heritage for 
Sailors and former Sailors and their families.
        (1) COMUSFLTFORCOM will develop a strategic plan and direct execution 
Navy-wide.
        (2) Per reference (c) and to the extent feasible, 240 BDAY events
should leverage tours of Navy installations, fitness events, U.S. Navy Band
performances, Navy Birthday Ceremonies, Navy Birthday Balls, Navy Heritage
Celebrations, and similar events to raise awareness of our Navy Birthday,
History and Heritage Paragraph 0507 of reference (e) provides guidance
concerning public engagement events appropriate for commemoration of our
Navy's Birthday.

4.  Execution:
    a.  CNO'S intent.
        (1) Purpose.  Synchronize the Navy's efforts in celebrating its
240th Birthday to gain the maximum institutional benefit for internal and
external audiences.
        (2) Method.  OPNAV and COMUSFLTFORCOM will provide the guidance and 
oversight necessary to align commands on the preparation and execution of 
240th BDAY.  As part of this effort, best practices developed for the
239th BDAY Celebration will be refined for use in 240th BDAY and future 
commemorations.
        (3)  End State.
            (a) Enhanced Naval heritage and traditions;
            (b) Maximized opportunities for participation in Navy 
commemoration events;
            (c) Increased awareness of, and support for, the Navy by key 
audiences;
            (d) Improved Navy-wide processes and coordination for Navy 
Birthday commemorations.
    b.  Initial Planning Guidance.
        (1) Use the 240 BDAY as an avenue to share Naval history and 
heritage.
        (2) Plan and execute 240 BDAY in a manner consistent with above 
references and other applicable laws and policy.
        (3) Identify guest speakers/guests of honor early in the planning 
process, with an eye toward maximum institutional benefit.
    c.  Official and Unofficial Navy Birthday Related Events:  Based on
COMUSFLTORSCOM feedback from the 239 BDAY process, this PLANORD contains 
express authorization for official Navy Birthday Commemoration Ceremonies to 
be held in connection with unofficial Navy Birthday Balls and similar social 
events (e.g. in a "two tiered" fashion) where feasible and to the extent 
consistent with law and regulation.  A "two tiered" approach may be employed 
to better leverage official engagement opportunities associated with certain 
unofficial Navy Birthday related events and allow for more flexibility in 
unit level planning of official evolutions.
        (1) Official Navy Birthday Commemoration Ceremonies.  Official
Navy Birthday Commemoration Ceremonies directly support the mission of the 
U.S. Navy.  They are authorized on a stand-alone basis (e.g. a ceremony 
onboard a Navy installation) as well as when held in conjunction with 
unofficial Navy Birthday Balls and similar social events.  Official Navy 
Birthday Ceremonies held in conjunction with unofficial Navy Birthday Balls 
and similar social events will normally follow a "two-tiered" sequence: Tier 
1 (official Navy Birthday Commemoration Ceremony) followed by Tier 2 
(unofficial Navy Birthday Ball or similar social event). Official Navy 
Birthday Commemoration Ceremonies often include (subject to availability) a 
Navy color guard, a performance by the Navy Band (for ceremonial music only), 
a presentation or pageant commemorating the Navy's Birthday and mission, and 
appropriate Guest of Honor remarks.  Active unit level planning, management, 
and execution efforts in support of Official Navy Birthday Commemoration 
Ceremonies is authorized in a manner consistent with mission, resource and 
legal constraints. These efforts may include provision of the following in 
support of official ceremony requirements: security, transportation of
Ceremonial participants, ceremony photography, informational notifications 
via official military information channels, audio/visual support, and other 
appropriate logistical support required for the official ceremony. Official 
Navy Birthday Commemoration Ceremonies are to be conducted to in a manner 
consistent with applicable mission, resource, and legal constraints.
        (2) Unofficial Navy Birthday Balls and Similar Social Functions.
Though sometimes held in conjunction with an Official Navy Birthday
Commemoration Ceremony, Navy Birthday Balls and similar social events are 
traditionally organized by groups of Sailors acting in an unofficial capacity 
or other non-federal entities (NFE) chartered to provide support to the 
military and/or its service members.  These events normally involve an 
invited Navy speaker or guest of honor, dinner, musical entertainment, 
dancing, refreshments, and other social activities. Navy Birthday Balls are 
normally supported through NFE organized ticket sales to attendees, though 
they may also be supported by appropriate NFE fundraising activities, and 
non-appropriated funds (NAF), if available and authorized by law and policy.  
While Navy Birthday Balls involve celebrations of the Navy's birthday, 
history and heritage, they are not official Navy events.  Given that Navy 
Birthday Balls and similar social events involve celebrations of the Navy's 
mission and heritage and are normally attended by a broad cross section of 
active duty and civilian Navy personnel and their families as well as members 
of local Navy host communities, they often afford important Navy engagement 
opportunities.  Therefore, the Navy may provide limited logistical support to 
unofficial Navy Birthday Balls (e.g. to include official speakers and 
notifications to military personnel through military information channels) as 
consistent with reference (d).
        (3) Resource and Funding Constraints.  It is important that 
participation of Navy personnel and use of Navy resources in support of Navy 
Birthday related events receive appropriate prior review to determine the 
nature of the Navy Birthday related event (e.g. official or unofficial) and 
to further ensure that any use of official time and appropriated and/or non-
appropriated funds employed in support are consistent with fiscal and 
standards of conduct requirements. Review by servicing legal counsel of unit-
level evolution planning and execution is advised.  Appropriated funds are 
generally unavailable for unofficial events and may not be used for feeding 
and entertainment of Navy and/or other persons absent express statutory 
authority. Any fundraising and other similar activities must comply with 
references (d) and (i).  Gift acceptance by Navy personnel must also comply 
with references (d) and (i) or (j) and (k) as applicable. Reference (l) 
contains policy on MWR support to Navy Birthday Celebrations, to include 
authorization of limited MWR non appropriated funds via Navy Region and 
Installation Commanders in certain cases. See paragraph 5. below for 
additional funding guidance.
        (4) Maximum use of the Navy Lessons Learned Information System 
(NLLIS) to capture best practices and lessons learned for events surrounding 
the 240 BDAY is directed.
        (5) Further develop measures of effectiveness and performance (MOPs 
and MOEs) for activities associated with the 240 BDAY, building on efforts 
from the 239 BDAY.
    c.  Tasking.
        (1) COMUSFLTFORCOM assign appropriate representation to support 
phases I through III.
        (2) Provide initial, mid, and final planning reviews as well as a 
detailed after action report to DNS following 240 BDAY.

5.  Funding.  Per reference (b), funding of outreach events should come from 
within existing programmed and budgeted resources and must be consistent with 
applicable law and policy.  Individual commands are responsible for funding 
all costs and ensuring judiciousness in the use of appropriated funds.  
Reference (f) provides additional community outreach guidance and funding 
limitations for Fiscal Year 2015.

6.  Command relationships.
    a.  COMUSFLTFORCOM  is the supported command.
    b.  CNIC, COMNAVRESFORCOM, CHINFO AND NAVHISTHERITAGECOM are supporting 
commanders.
