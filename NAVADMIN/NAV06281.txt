SUBJ/NAVY BIRTHDAY 2006 -- STILL DEFENDING FREEDOM//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  FOR THE FIFTH STRAIGHT YEAR WE WILL CELEBRATE OUR
NAVYS BIRTHDAY -- THIS ONE THE 231ST -- AT WAR.  IN FACT, IT WAS
FIVE YEARS AGO THIS MONTH THAT NAVAL FORCES LAUNCHED THE FIRST
STRIKES AGAINST THE TALIBAN FROM SHIPS STEAMING IN THE INDIAN OCEAN.
TODAY, FROM THE WESTERN PACIFIC INTO THE PERSIAN GULF AND
MEDITERRANEAN, ALL THE WAY TO THE HORN OF AFRICA AND EVEN TO OUR OWN
SHORES, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DEPLOYED SAILORS CONTINUE TO TAKE THE
FIGHT TO THE ENEMY.
2.  WE ARE HELPING STEM THE TIDE OF TERRORISM AND PREVENTING THE
CONDITIONS FROM WHICH IT PROLIFERATES, AND WE ARE DOING IT ALL IN
MAGNIFICENT FASHION.  I NOTE WITH PARTICULAR PRIDE THAT THERE ARE
MORE SAILORS SUPPORTING OPERATIONS ON THE GROUND IN THE CENTRAL
COMMAND AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY (12,500) THAN WE HAVE AT SEA IN THE
SAME THEATER.  AS INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEES OR AS UNITS, THESE BRAVE MEN
AND WOMEN ARE BEARING WELL THE LEGACY OF COURAGE UNDER FIRE LEFT US
BY OUR PREDECESSORS IN NAVY BLUE.
3.  SOME OF THOSE PREDECESSORS HELPED WIN THE COLD WAR, ANOTHER
GLOBAL STRUGGLE AGAINST ENEMIES OF FREEDOM, WHICH BEGAN SIXTY YEARS
AGO.  MORE THAN 2,000 OF OUR SHIPMATES MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE
IN KOREA AND VIETNAM, AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS WERE WOUNDED.  DUE TO
THEIR EFFORTS, AND THE SUSTAINED, STEADY EFFORT BY THE HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF OTHER MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED IN THE NAVY DURING THIS
CRITICAL PERIOD, THE COLD WAR ENDED PEACEFULLY AND DEMOCRACY WAS
EMBRACED BY MUCH OF THE WORLD.  I ENCOURAGE NAVY COMMANDS TO
INCORPORATE COLD WAR THEMES INTO THEIR 2006 NAVY BIRTHDAY EVENTS AND
TO HONOR FORMER COLD WARRIORS DURING APPROPRIATE CEREMONIES.
4.  THE NAVAL HISTORICAL CENTER [NHC], NAVAL HISTORICAL FOUNDATION
[NHF] AND HISTORIC NAVAL SHIPS ASSOCIATION [HNSA] STAND READY TO
ASSIST.  THE NHC WEBPAGE WWW.HISTORY.NAVY.MIL CONTAINS A VAST
ARCHIVE OF COLD-WAR RELATED MATERIAL AND INCLUDES MANY HISTORICAL
RESOURCES.  THE CENTER HAS ALSO INITIATED AN EXPANSION OF THE
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE U.S. NAVY TO INCLUDE A GALLERY ENTITLED "THE
NAVY IN THE COLD WAR: KOREA, VIETNAM, AND THE SOVIET CONFRONTATION."
 WHILE THE GALLERY WILL NOT BE COMPLETED IN 2006, THERE ARE
MATERIALS AVAILABLE THAT THE NHC CAN PROVIDE THAT DISCUSSES THE
GALLERYS PROPOSED CONTENT.
5.  THE NHF WEBSITE WWW.NAVYHISTORY.ORG FEATURES A NAVAL HERITAGE
SPEAKERS LIST THAT INCLUDES EXPERTS CONVERSANT ON COLD WAR SUBJECTS
AND, LIKE THE NHC, OFFERS ORAL HISTORY COLLECTIONS FEATURING
INTERVIEWS WITH NUMEROUS COLD WAR VETERANS.  INFORMATION ABOUT SHIPS
THAT SAW SERVICE DURING THE COLD WAR CAN BE FOUND AT HNSAS
WWW.HNSA.ORG WEBSITE.  POINTS OF CONTACT INCLUDE:
- NHC: MR. JACK GREEN, 202-433-7880, JACK.GREEN@NAVY.MIL
- NHF: DR. DAVE WINKLER, 202-678-4333, DWINKLER@NAVYHISTORY.ORG
- HNSA: MR. JEFF NILSSON, 757-356-9422, INFO@HNSA.ORG.
6.  AS ONE OF MY PREDECESSORS, ADM GEORGE ANDERSON (CNO 1961-1963)
-- A COLD WARRIOR HIMSELF -- PUT IT, "THE NAVY HAS BOTH A TRADITION
AND A FUTURE, AND WE LOOK WITH PRIDE AND CONFIDENCE IN BOTH
DIRECTIONS."  I KNOW YOU SHARE THAT PRIDE AND CONFIDENCE WITH ME.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SHIPMATES.
7.  ADM MIKE MULLEN, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
