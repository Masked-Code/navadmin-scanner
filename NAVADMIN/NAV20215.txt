RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces a modification to paragraph 5.b of reference 
(a) and the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Active-Duty Officer Continuation Plan.

2.  Paragraph 5.b is modified to read:
    b.  All Chief Warrant Officers (CWO) who are on Active Duty at the time 
the promotion board meets and are considered in zone for promotion and who 
are subject to mandatory retirement for years of active service prior to the 
release of the selection list will be considered for continuation.  If 
selected, these officers will be continued for a period sufficient to allow 
them to accept promotion or, if not selected for promotion, until the last 
day of the calendar month following the month in which the FY-21 CWO 
promotion selection board results are released (e.g. if the ALNAV announcing 
the results is released in December 2020, continuation will go through 31 Jan 
2021).

3.  All other provisions of references (a) through (e) remain in effect.

4.  This NAVADMIN will be canceled for record purposes on 30 September 2020.

5.  Released by Vice Admiral John B. Nowell, Jr, N1.//
