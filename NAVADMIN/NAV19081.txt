RMKS/1.  The Navy League of the United States (NLUS) will hold its annual 
Sea-Air-Space (SAS) exposition from 6 to 8 May, 2019 at the Gaylord National 
Resort and Conference Center, located in National Harbor, MD.  SAS provides a 
platform for the professional development of Department of the Navy personnel 
on the latest developments in naval warfare, as well as an opportunity for 
Navy engagement with representatives from a broad cross-section of 
government, industry, academia, and the international community.

2.  This year’s SAS theme “Sustainability, Agility, Superiority”
is appropriate in this age of growing maritime competition.  The SAS schedule 
is designed with a focus on readiness and innovation, with panels covering 
topics such as acquisition, cyber, strategic sealift, leadership, 
shipbuilding, and manpower.  SAS will showcase leaders from across the United 
States Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, other governmental agencies and 
industry.  Additionally, many international delegations will be in 
attendance, including several Heads of Navy (HoN).  A full list of speakers 
and more information on international representation can be found at 
www.seaairspace.org.

3.  Per reference (a), attendance at non-DoD hosted conferences which have 
historically exceeded $250,000 may require SECNAV/UNSECNAV approval.  SAS 
2019 meets this threshold.  Therefore, requests for attendance shall be 
consolidated by Echelon-2 commands and provided to OPNAV N98 with the number 
of attendees and cost estimates to N98 POCs: CDR Brian Binder at 
brian.a.binder(at)navy.mil, (703)695-1669 and LCDR Kyle Johnson at 
kyle.j.johnson(at)navy.mil, (703)695-8548 to track overall costs and 
attendance data.  Final conference requests are to be submitted no later than 
12 April, 2019.  Overall approval of DON-wide attendance is expected in mid-
April.  If no cost is incurred by the government (i.e. people local to area), 
no submission or approval is required.  The following restrictions apply:
    a.  Subject to command discretion, attendance is authorized for local 
participants at no cost to the government.
    b.  SAS 2019 is primarily an East Coast event.  Funded TAD travel from 
West Coast/International commands should be closely examined unless member 
has an active role in the event (sitting on a panel, making an official U.S. 
Navy presentation, etc).  Excessive attendance will be subject to cuts based 
on overall cost.
    c.  NLUS has offered free attendance at the below ten events to all 
military and civilian personnel.  Because there is a maximum number of seats 
available, attendees are required to pre-register.
Per reference (b), this free attendance does not constitute a gift for 
purposes of applicable ethics regulations, and therefore may be accepted by 
all military and civilian personnel.

        (1) Opening ceremonies and plenary sessions
        (2) Sea Services luncheon
        (3) Sea-Air-Space luncheon

    d.  Additionally, on the first day of SAS there is a Cohen Group 
breakfast that is an “invitation only" event.  If invited, attendees should 
consult with their ethics counselor for assistance in determining whether 
attendance is permissible.
    e.  All Navy participation in SAS 2019 shall be consistent with the Joint 
Ethics Regulations found at reference (c).

4.  Registration information is available on the SAS website at 
www.seaairspace.org.  There is no charge to attend SAS for Navy qualified

    b.  Active duty and reserve U.S. military
    c.  Retired U.S. Navy personnel
    d.  U.S. federal, state and local government employees
    e.  NLUS Members

5.  Within the National Capital Region, transportation to SAS 2019 will be 
available from the Pentagon, Naval Support Facility, Washington Navy Yard, 
Naval Research Laboratory, Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, Crystal City, Office 
of Naval Intelligence, and Coast Guard Headquarters. This service will

Maryland, and Dahlgren and Quantico in Virginia.  Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania 
will have one roundtrip on one day of the event. More information and bus
