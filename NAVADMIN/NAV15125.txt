RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces that the Ombudsman Registry

required to execute Public Key Infrastructure Enforcement (PKIE) and 
Cryptographic Logon (CLO).  A CAC will be required to access the Ombudsman 
Registry website, however, the "Contact Your Ombudsman" feature will remain 
accessible to all family members attempting to contact their Command

submit an Ombudsman Monthly/Quarterly Worksheet via the automated ombudsman 
data collection system at www.ombudsmanregistry.org.  Commanding Officers of

behalf of the command.  As of 1 October 2015, ombudsmen will no longer be 
able to perform this function via the Ombudsman Registry, as they will not be 
issued Volunteer Logistical Access Credentials Cards (VOLACs) to access the 
Ombudsman Registry.

will email the Ombudsman Monthly/Quarterly Worksheet to the Commander, Navy
