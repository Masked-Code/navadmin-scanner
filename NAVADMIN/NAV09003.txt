OBSERVANCE DAY TO BE HELD ON JANUARY 19, 2009.  THIS YEAR'S THEME,

CHAMPION OUR DIVERSITY AND CELEBRATE THE HARD WON FREEDOMS AS DR. 
KING INTENDED.
2.  DR. KING ENVISIONED A UNITED AMERICA CREATED THROUGH NON- VIOLENT 
SOCIAL CHANGE.  HE LEARNED FROM HISTORY, THEOLOGY, AND THE EXAMPLE OF 
OTHERS, AND HIS GIFT WAS IN TRANSLATING THOSE LESSONS INTO MESSAGES
