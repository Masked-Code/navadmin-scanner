SUBJ/FY-10 ACTIVE DUTY E-9, E-8 AND E-7 SELECTION BOARD MEMBERSHIP 
NOMINATIONS// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE SOLICITATION OF ENLISTED SELECTION 
BOARD PARTICIPANTS FOR THE FY-10 ACTIVE DUTY MASTER CHIEF, SENIOR CHIEF 
AND CHIEF PETTY OFFICER SELECTION BOARDS.  THE BOARDS ARE SCHEDULED FOR 
30 MARCH THROUGH 10 APRIL 2009 FOR E-9, 20 APRIL THROUGH 8 MAY 2009 FOR 
E-8, AND 22 JUNE THROUGH 24 JULY 2009 FOR E-7.  NOMINATIONS ARE DUE TO 
PERS-81 BY 19 DECEMBER 2008 FOR THE E-9 BOARD, 16 JANUARY 2009 FOR THE 
E-8 BOARD AND
6 MARCH 2009 FOR THE E-7 BOARD.
2.  A MASTER CHIEF'S CAREER IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL THEY HAVE 
PARTICIPATED AS AN ENLISTED SELECTION BOARD MEMBER.  EVERY SENIOR 
LEADER IN OUR NAVY IS BUSY WITH MANAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP CHALLENGES AT 
THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMANDS, BUT PARTICIPATION BY SENIOR LEADERS IN 
SELECTION BOARDS IS PARAMOUNT TO NAVY'S CONTINUED SUCCESS IN SELECTING 
21ST CENTURY LEADERS.  EVERY MASTER CHIEF PETTY OFFICER NOT OTHERWISE 
RESTRICTED FROM PARTICIPATING IN AN ENLISTED SELECTION BOARD IS 
STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO VOLUNTEER TO SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE FY-10 
ACTIVE DUTY MASTER CHIEF, 
SENIOR CHIEF OR CHIEF PETTY OFFICER SELECTION BOARD.    
3.  SOME COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT MEMBERSHIP ON AN ENLISTED 
SELECTION BOARD INCLUDE:
    A.  FROCKED MASTER CHIEFS CANNOT PARTICIPATE AS A SELECTION BOARD 
MEMBER.  FROCKED MASTER CHIEFS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE 
IN THE ENLISTED SELECTION BOARD PROCESS.  AS A FROCKED MASTER CHIEF, 
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SAILORS IMPACTED THROUGH EARLY PARTICIPATION IS 
MUCH GREATER.  
THE EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM EXPOSURE TO THE SELECTION BOARD PROCESS IS 
PARAMOUNT TO A MASTER CHIEF'S SUCCESS AS A LEADER.
    B.  MASTER CHIEFS WITH PCS ORDERS TO TRANSFER DURING SELECTION 
BOARDS CANNOT PARTICIPATE.  NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND CAN PROVIDE ORDMODS 
IF MASTER CHIEFS ARE SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN A SELECTION BOARD.
    C.  MASTER CHIEFS WITH PROMOTABLE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THEIR LAST 
EVALUATION/FITREP ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR BOARD MEMBERSHIP.  ON PREVIOUS 
SELECTION BOARD APPLICATIONS, A MEMBER WAS REQUIRED TO HAVE AT LEAST A 
MUST PROMOTE PROMOTION RECOMMENDATION IN ORDER TO APPLY; HOWEVER, THAT 
RESTRICTION HAS BEEN REMOVED.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF THERE ARE THREE MASTER 
CHIEFS ASSIGNED TO THE SAME COMMAND, ONE OF THE MASTER CHIEFS MUST 
RECEIVE A PROMOTABLE RECOMMENDATION.  
THE MASTER CHIEF WHO RECEIVED A PROMOTABLE PROMOTION RECOMMENDATION IN 
THIS SCENARIO SHOULD NOT BE PREVENTED FROM PARTICIPATING IN AN ENLISTED 
SELECTION BOARD BECAUSE OF THAT RECOMMENDATION.
    D.  MASTER CHIEFS WITH A FAMILY MEMBER WITH A MEDICAL OR PERSONAL 
ISSUE WHO ASSUME THEY CANNOT PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A SELECTION 
BOARD SHOULD DISCUSS THEIR SITUATION WITH THEIR COMMAND MASTER CHIEF, 
COMMANDING OFFICER, AND THE BOARD SPONSOR.  A FEASIBLE SOLUTION MAY 
ALLOW THEM TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A SELECTION BOARD.  
4.  THE APPLICATION/NOMINATION FORM CAN BE ACCESSED AT:

FY10ENLISTEDSELECTIONBOARDNOMINATIONCH1.DOC.  
THE APPLICATION/NOMINATION MUST BE ROUTED THROUGH COMMANDING OFFICERS 
AND COMMAND MASTER CHIEFS FOR SUBMISSION TO THE COGNIZANT FLEET AND 
FORCE MASTER CHIEFS.  
IF THE FORM IS BEING SUBMITTED BY A CMC/COB/SEL, THE COMMANDING OFFICER 
SHOULD CONDUCT THE REQUIRED COUNSELING, SIGNING THE FORM IN THE 
CMC/COB/SEL SIGNATURE SPACE.
5.  CAREFUL CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO A NOMINEE'S AVAILABILITY 
TO SERVE ON THE SELECTION BOARDS.  COMMANDING OFFICER CONCURRENCE FOR 
THE NOMINEE TO PARTICIPATE IN A BOARD IS REQUIRED.  COMMANDING OFFICERS, 
COMMAND MASTER CHIEFS, AND THE ENLISTED SELECTION BOARD PARTICIPANTS 
MUST UNDERSTAND THAT ONCE SELECTED, BOARD DUTY IS NOT OPTIONAL.  
SELECTED MEMBERS WILL NOT BE EXCUSED EXCEPT IN THE MOST EXTREME CASES.  
6.  SELECTION BOARD MEMBERSHIP NOMINEES SHALL:
    A.  NOT HAVE THEIR SPOUSE OR OTHER RELATIVE, WHETHER BY BLOOD OR 
MARRIAGE, ELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE BOARD FOR WHICH THEY ARE 
APPLYING.  RELATIVE SHALL INCLUDE, BY BLOOD OR MARRIAGE, ADOPTION OR 
BLENDED FAMILY, ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RELATIONSHIPS:  PARENT, CHILD, 
SIBLING, UNCLE OR AUNT, NEPHEW OR NIECE, OR FIRST COUSIN (INCLUDES EX).
