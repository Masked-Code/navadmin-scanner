RMKS/1.  The annual Secretary of Defense Awards Program recognizes the 
Department of Defenses most outstanding field-level and depot-level military 
maintenance units from a very competitive field of candidates.  I would like 
to extend my congratulations and gratitude for all Navy units that submitted 
nomination packages in accordance with references (a) and (b).  Each nominee 
should be proud of their accomplishments.

2.  References (c) and (d) announced the winners of 2015 Secretary of Defense 
Maintenance Awards for field-level and depot-level maintenance.  Navy 
displayed a strong showing for field-level maintenance.  The field-level 
awards are given to two of the most outstanding field-level maintenance units 
in each of three categories (small, medium, large) across the Department of 
Defense.  The Navy winners for the 2015 SECDEF Maintenance Awards are as 
follows:
Field-Level Large Category:  TRIDENT Refit Facility (TRF), Kings Bay, GA
Field-Level Medium Category:  USS GETTYSBURG (CG-64), Naval Station Mayport, 
FL

3.  These awards will be formally presented to the winning units on 8 
December 2015 during the Secretary of Defense Maintenance Awards Ceremony in 
Phoenix, AZ.  The highlight of this event will be the announcement of the 
Phoenix Award.  The Phoenix Award goes to the very best maintenance unit from 
the field-level awards winners.  It represents the very best of all the 
field-level winners, and is the highest award for field-level maintenance.

4.  The 2015 Department of Defense Maintenance Symposium will be held from 7-
11 December 2015, at the Phoenix Convention Center, located in Phoenix, AZ.  
The Department of Defense Maintenance Symposium is DoD's premier maintenance 
community event, and is intended to be a forum to discuss key maintenance 
related topics and increase the overall awareness of DoD maintenance 
initiatives.  The symposium is open to DoD contractors, civilian, and 
military personnel from all Services.  Maximum participation from the 
maintenance community is highly encouraged.  Interested personnel can 
register at (http://www.sae.org/events/dod/attend/hotel-travel).

5.  Congratulations on a job well done to both TRF Kings Bay and USS 
GETTYSBURG! Your efforts exemplify excellence in the maintenance profession 
within the United States Navy, which has garnered recognition throughout the 
Department of Defense.  You should be very proud of your accomplishments, as 
you now represent the best of military maintenance.  BRAVO ZULU!
