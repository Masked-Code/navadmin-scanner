SUBJ/NAVY BIRTHDAY 2009// 

RMKS/1.  ON 13 OCTOBER 1775, THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS COMMISSIONED 
TWO ARMED VESSELS TO INTERCEPT SHIPS CARRYING SUPPLIES TO THE BRITISH ARMY.  
IT WAS A COURAGEOUS AND BOLD DECISION FOR THE COLONIES, ONE WHICH WOULD 
EVENTUALLY LEAD TO VICTORY IN OUR WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE AND THE CREATION 
OF OUR NAVY.  234 YEARS LATER, BECAUSE OF YOU, YOUR FAMILIES, AND ALL OUR 
SHIPMATES WHO HAVE GONE BEFORE US, AMERICA'S NAVY CONTINUES TO BUILD ON 
OUR LEGACY OF SERVICE AND TRADITION OF BEING A "GLOBAL FORCE FOR GOOD,
" A LEGACY WHICH CONTINUES TO BE UNMATCHED IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.

2.  OUR SAILORS AND CIVILIANS ARE DEPLOYED AROUND THE GLOBE DEFENDING 
AMERICA'S INTERESTS.  WE ARE IN AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ, AND SURROUNDING WATERS, 
SUPPORTING OUR FORCES AND CONDUCTING COUNTER-PIRACY OPERATIONS TO DEFEND 
THE WORLD'S VITAL COMMERCIAL SHIPPING LANES. WE ARE ENGAGED IN THE PACIFIC, 
AFRICA, AND SOUTH AMERICA, BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER NAVIES AND 
PROVIDING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO THOSE IN NEED.  AND WE ARE IN THE 
MEDITERRANEAN, DETERRING AND PROMOTING PEACE IN A REGION THAT HAS LONG 
BEEN CRUCIAL TO GLOBAL STABILITY.  

3.  I THANK YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES FOR ALL YOU DO.  YOU ARE SHINING EXAMPLES 
OF HONOR, COURAGE, AND COMMITMENT AND AN INSPIRATION TO ALL.
YOU MAKE OUR NAVY GREAT - IT IS YOUR EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE THAT WE CELEBRATE.  
AS SUCH, ON 13 OCTOBER, WHETHER YOU ARE AT SEA OR ASHORE, I ASK THAT YOU 
TAKE A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON YOUR EXTRAORDINARY ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND OUR 
NAVY'S 234-YEAR LEGACY WHICH EACH OF YOU CONTINUE TO BUILD UPON.  

4.  WE SERVE IN THE GREATEST NAVY THAT HAS EVER SAILED, AND IN THE 
WORDS OF OUR FIRST COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, GEORGE WASHINGTON, "IT FOLLOWS 
THAT AS CERTAIN THAT NIGHT SUCCEEDS THE DAY, THAT WITHOUT A DECISIVE 
NAVAL FORCE, WE CAN DO NOTHING DEFINITIVE AND WITH IT, EVERYTHING HONORABLE 
AND GLORIOUS."  HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SHIPMATES.  

5.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
