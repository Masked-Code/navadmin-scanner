RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the implementation of Uniform National 
Discharge Standards (UNDS), Batch 1.

2.  Background.
    a.  As of 19 June 2019, Navy vessels (USS, USNS, combatant craft,
    service craft, boats, and any other artificial contrivance) are
    required to comply with new UNDS for the following eleven Batch 1
    discharges:
        (1) Aqueous Film-Forming Foam
        (2) Chain Locker Effluent
        (3) Distillation and Reverse Osmosis Brine
        (4) Elevator Pit Effluent
        (5) Gas Turbine Water Wash
        (6) Non Oily Machinery Wastewater
        (7) Photographic Laboratory Drains
        (8) Seawater Cooling Overboard Discharge
        (9) Seawater Piping Biofouling Prevention
        (10) Small Boat Engine Wet Exhaust
        (11) Welldeck Discharges
    b. The UNDS requirements are available at https
    ://www.esd.whs.mil/dd/ and reference (a).
    c. Existing Navy operations should already be in compliance with
    most of the discharge standards through the use of current systems
    and practices. However, the new requirements will impose some
    additional reporting, information logging, and record-keeping
    responsibilities.  These include, but are not limited to:
    (1) All commands that own or operate one or more vessels will
        be required to assign an UNDS Person in Charge (PIC) for each
        vessel.  The PIC will be responsible for ensuring compliance with
        the UNDS discharge requirements as well as all UNDS reporting and
        recordkeeping requirements. For larger vessels, the UNDS PIC duties
        are expected to be assigned to the ship's Commanding Officer or
        vessel master; for smaller vessels, a single person can be assigned
        PIC duties for multiple vessels.
    (2) Vessels that inadvertently make a discharge of one of the
        UNDS, Batch 1 discharges that does not comply with the UNDS
        standards must submit an UNDS non-compliance report within five
        days.  Use the Hazardous Substance Release Report format found in
        reference (b), Appendix C but change the subject line to SUBJ/UNDS
        NON-COMPLIANCE REPORT and INFO the appropriate Navy Regional
        Environmental Coordinator (REC) where the vessel is homeported.
    (3) Discharge specific records will be required for certain
        discharges such as chain locker effluent and small boat engine wet
        exhaust.
    d. UNDS regulations are federal regulations, based on the
    federal Clean Water Act.  It is imperative that all Navy vessels are
    in full compliance with these requirements, as failure to comply
    could result in civil actions against the Navy.
    e. The UNDS requirements supersede any standards currently in
    place for a U.S. state or locality, and provide a single set of
    discharge standards nationwide.  Attempts by a state or locality to
    apply additional state or local regulations or permits to these
    discharges must be reported to the appropriate Navy REC.
    f. U.S. Coast Guard or State officials have the authority to
    enforce UNDS requirements.  If such officials request access to
    vessels or records, follow the procedures in reference (b), Chapter
    35 and coordinate with the appropriate Navy REC.

3. Actions.  U.S. Fleet Forces and Pacific Fleet promulgate to Type 
Commanders and all ships and submarines.  Commander Navy Installations 
Command promulgate to all installations with small boats and to all Navy 
RECs.  All other Echelon 2 commands, and Office of Naval Research, promulgate 
to appropriate subordinate commands.
