RMKS/1.  Per references (a) and (b), prior to a Sailor participating in the 
Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA) in the fall of 2021, completion of a 
Physical Activity Risk Factor Questionnaire (PARFQ) is required.  A Periodic 
Health Assessment (PHA) within the past 12 months, as well as a Post-
Deployment Health Re-Assessment (PDHRA) when applicable, is required for 
completion of the PARFQ. 
This NAVADMIN provides guidance for completion of the PHA and/or PDHRA prior 
to a Sailors participation in the fall 2021 PFA. 
 
2.  Medical Cognizance 
    a.  The Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) has established Medical 
Cognizance (MEDCOG) for medical readiness purposes for every unit in the 
Navy, both Active and Reserve, based on physical location.  MEDCOG support 
responsibilities are prescribed to Navy Medicine Readiness and Training 
Commands (NAVMEDREADTRNCOM), located at Military Treatment Facilities.  Each 
NAVMEDREADTRNCOM utilizes their Operational Forces Medical Liaison Services 
(OFMLS) as well as the Readiness clinics to support all Sailors within their 
MEDCOG. 
    b.  Sailors or Commands who are remote or without an embedded medical 
provider capable of performing these assessments will access a provider via 
MEDCOG, by contacting the appropriate point of contact (POC) as outlined in 
paragraph 4.a. of this NAVADMIN in order to schedule their assessments.  If 
Sailors or Commands are uncertain which NAVMEDREADTRNCOM MEDCOG POC is 
assigned to their unit, they can contact the designated POC for Naval Medical 
Forces Pacific or Atlantic as appropriate for their unit per section 4.b. and 
4.c. of this NAVADMIN.  When available, an embedded medical provider or 
locally available Department of Defense medical provider should be used to 
complete the PHA and/or PDHRA. 
 
3.  Sailor Responsibilities and Procedures 
    a.  Each Sailor is required by references (c), (d), and (e) to maintain 
his or her medical readiness requirements, including the completion of the 
PHA and PDHRA.  The Sailor must complete his or her portion of the specified 
assessment(s) prior to contacting his or her medical department or the 
NAVMEDREADTRNCOM. 
    b.  In order to complete Part I of either assessment, the Sailor must log 
in with their Common Access Card (CAC) to the new electronic Health 
Assessment (EHA) website.  The electronic Periodic Health Assessment (EPHA) 
and electronic Deployment Health Assessment (EDHA) websites are consolidated 
into a single site called the electronic Health Assessment (EHA) website, 
located at https://data.nmcphc.med.navy.mil/eha/.  Both the EPHA and EDHA 
websites have a redirect notice to the EHA website, and both currently 
maintain functionality if there is an issue accessing the EHA site. 
    c.  When a Sailor needs to complete a PHA, he or she must select My PHA 
under the PHA link, then click Start New Assessment. 
    d.  When a Sailor needs to complete any deployment related health 
assessment, including the PDHRA, he or she must select Deployer under EDHA. 
If an assessment is required, it will be highlighted with an orange Start 
button, and correspond to the Sailors outstanding assessments reported in the 
Medical Readiness Reporting System (MRRS). 
    e.  In the event the MRRS required deployment related health assessment 
is not highlighted appropriately with the orange Start button, a Sailor can 
bypass this by selecting the blue Report a New Assessment button or blue 
Report a New Standalone Deployment Mental Health Assessment (DMHA) button if 
only a mental health assessment is required. 
    f.  Upon completion of the Service member portion of a PHA, PDHRA, or 
other assessment on the EHA website, Service members must contact their 
embedded medical POC or identified MEDCOG POC, per paragraph 4 of this 
NAVADMIN, to schedule the record review and Provider portion of the 
assessment, Part II.  Both Part I and Part II must be complete in order for a 
Service members PHA, PDHRA, or other EHA to be certified. 

4.  MEDCOG POCs 
    a.  Naval Medical Forces Pacific (NAVMEDFORPAC) and Atlantic 
(NAVMEDFORLANT) have established regional support strategies specific to 
their MEDCOGs, which are kept up to date and can be found at: 
https://esportal.med.navy.mil/bumed/rh/m3/M34/SMMR/PHA_Regional_POCs/default.
