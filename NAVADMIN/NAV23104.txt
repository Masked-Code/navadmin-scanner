    a.  This program expands the reimbursement of relicensing costs 
to include business costs for business-owning spouses, and extends 
the eligibility reimbursement period from 31 December 2024 to 31 
December 2029, in line with references (a) through (c). 
    b.  This program will expand MyCareer Advancement Account 
(MyCAA) eligibility to include pay grades E-6 and O-3. 
    c.  This program enables portability for professional licenses 
between states. 
 
2.  Expanded Spouse Relicensing/Business Cost Policy: 
    a.  A Service Member may now be reimbursed up to $1,000 for 
their spouse's qualified business costs incident to a permanent 
change of station (PCS) move.  The spouse must have owned a business 
at the previous permanent duty station. 
    b.  The term qualified business costs includes moving services 
for equipment, equipment removal, new equipment purchases, 
information technology expenses and inspection fees incurred by the 
spouse. 
    c.  Reimbursement for business costs is effective for PCS orders 
issued on or after 23 December 2022.

3.  MyCAA is a scholarship program providing up to $4,000 in 
financial assistance for licenses, certifications, national tests, 
or associate degrees to pursue an occupation or career field. 
Eligibility includes military spouses of Active Duty Service Members 
in pay grades E-1 to E-5, W-1 to W-2, and O-1 to O-2.   Reference 
(e) expanded the eligibility to include pay grades E-6 and O-3. 
 
4.  Reference (e) also announced that the Service members' Civil 
Relief Act (SCRA) now requires professional licenses to be portable 
(except for legal practice) for Service Members and their spouses 
who relocate between states due to military orders.  This amendment 
to the SCRA is designed to protect Service Members and their spouses 
with professional licenses to retain the use of that license when 
they move out of the jurisdiction covered by that license.  As this 
law is new, each state may have different procedures or 
requirements.  The Department of Defense states in reference (e) 
that it is committed to working with states to promote the sharing 
of licensure best practices and the approval of occupational 
licensure compacts.  This new law does not replace or diminish the 
Spouse Licensure Reimbursement Program and spouses can still apply 
for reimbursement for a new license. 
 
5.  Accessing spouse employment resources is easier with the MyNavy 
Family (MNF) Mobile Application.  It provides a single source of 
authoritative information designed specifically for spouses and 
family members.  The mobile application includes information on all 
available support services to assist family members navigate the
