RMKS/1.  October is National Cybersecurity Awareness Month.  While 
cybersecurity is always a Navy priority, October is when we sharpen our focus 
to ensure that all personnel are aware of their vital roles and 
responsibilities in keeping our information, systems, and platforms 
cybersecure.

2.  The threat to our platforms and missions is real and growing.  Using 
cyber tactics, adversaries and cyber criminals work to disrupt our networks; 
this includes impacting our critical infrastructure and Navy weapons systems.  
As adversaries improve their offensive cyber capabilities, threats such as 
these will only increase.  The threat is real and we are in the fight every 
day.

3.  Like damage control on a ship, cybersecurity is the responsibility of 
everyone.  Cybersecurity is an All Hands effort and integral to everything we 
do.  Robust cybersecurity ensures we can compete, fight and win across the 
spectrum from peaceful presence to violent conflict in all warfare domains.  
For us to prevail against determined foes, cybersecurity must be at the 
forefront of our actions at all times.

4.  During October, we will post content on navy.mil that explains how to 
keep the Navy safe in cyberspace and how to protect your personal 
information.  We ask leaders at all levels to use these materials to continue 
the ongoing cybersecurity dialog and education campaign, highlighting this 
critical responsibility for each of our Navy Sailors, officers, civilians, 
and contractors.  Every week in October will have a different theme for 
Cybersecurity Awareness Month:

    a.  Week One:  Cybersecurity Matters
    b.  Week Two:  Reducing Personal Cyber Risk
    c.  Week Three:  Reducing Mission Cyber Risk
    d.  Week Four:  Developing the Cybersecurity Workforce

5.  Training materials are posted to 
https://www.navy.mil/local/cyberawareness/ and updates will be provided in 
the Navy Plan of the Day at https://www.navy.mil/planofday.asp.  We will also 
repost many of the excellent cybersecurity resources from the Department of 
Homeland Security at https://niccs.us-cert.gov/national-cybersecurity-
awareness-month-2019.  Visit navy.mil during October to learn more about 
thecyber threats we face at work and at home and how to protect against them.

6.  We depend on you to make cybersecurity a priority because you are in the 
cyber battlespace whenever you log onto a system or network.  Your continued 
commitment to cybersecurity protects the Navy and the nation.

7.  Released by VADM Matthew J. Kohler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
