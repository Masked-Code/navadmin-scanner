NARR/REF A PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR THE NAVY SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIM 
INTERVENTION (SAVI) PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTLINES PROGRAM 
REQUIREMENTS.  REF B DIRECTS THE REPORTING OF SEXUAL ASSAULT(S) VIA THE 
OPREP-3 REPORTING SYSTEM.  REF C OUTLINES ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
AND CHANGES THE NAVY SAVI NAME TO SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION AND 
RESPONSE (SAPR).//

RMKS//1.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH REF A, THIS NAVADMIN IS THE FIRST IN A 
SERIES OF QUARTERLY UPDATES DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE FLEET WITH AN 
UPDATE ON NAVY'S SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE (SAPR) EFFORTS.  
THE CROSS FUNCTIONAL TEAM (CFT) CONTINUES TO MEET WEEKLY AND IS MAKING 
GREAT PROGRESS IN THE AREAS OF PREVENTION, RESPONSE/REPORTING, VICTIM 
ADVOCACY, AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

2.  PREVENTION.  AWARENESS THROUGH TRAINING, EDUCATION AND ACTIVE 
LEDERSHIP IS VITAL TO THE SUCCESS OF NAVY'S PREVENTION AND RESPONSE 
EFFORTS.  THE FIRST USFF COMMAND LED WATERFRONT LEADERSHIP AND FIRST 
RESPONDER SAPR WORKSHOP WAS HELD RECENTLY IN NORFOLK, VA, AND WILL BE 
FOLLOWED BY SIMILAR TRAINING EVENTS.  PREVENTION EFFORTS MUST FOCUS ON 
NON-STRANGER AND ALCOHOL-FACILITATED SEXUAL ASSAULT.  A BYSTANDER 
INTERVENTION PILOT PROGRAM KICKED OFF EARLIER THIS MONTH.
THIS TRAINING IS TAILORED TO SAILORS AND DECKPLATE LEADERS WHO ARE 
INSTRUMENTAL IN CREATING A CULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT THAT IS INTOLERANT 
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.  THE BYSTANDER INTERVENTION PROGRAM IS BASED ON A 
COMMUNITY OF RESPONSIBILITY MODEL THAT TEACHES MEN AND WOMEN HOW TO 
INTERVENE SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY IN CASES OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE BEFORE, 
DURING, AND AFTER INCIDENTS WITH STRANGERS, ACQUAINTANCES, OR FRIENDS.  
OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE A CULTURE OF RESPECT THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE 
NAVY ETHOS AND CORE VALUES.

3.  RESPONSE/REPORTING.  REF B HAS BEEN UPDATED WITH GUIDANCE THAT 
COMMANDERS ARE TO CONSULT A JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL (JAG) OFFICER PRIOR 
TO DISPOSITION OF ANY SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE.  SENIOR NAVY LEADERSHIP IS 
BRIEFED WEEKLY ON SAPR STATISTICS AND THE EXECUTION OF THE SAPR PROGRAM.

4.  VICTIM ADVOCACY.  A STRONG VICTIM ADVOCACY PROGRAM WILL ENABLE US 
TO BUILD A BOND OF TRUST WITH OUR SAILORS.  RESEARCH SHOWS THAT VICTIMS 
WHO RECEIVE STRONG ADVOCACY SERVICES ARE MORE LIKELY TO PARTICIPATE IN 
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, AND VICTIM PARTICIPATIONIS THE STRONGEST 
PREDICTOR OF CONVICTION.  THE NAVY'S VICTIM ADVOCACY TEAM IS COMPRISED 
OF PERSONNEL WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF SKILLS TO SUPPORT SEXUAL ASSAULT 
VICTIMS.  SEXUAL ASSAULT RESPONSE COORDINATORS (SARC) ARE AVAILABLE TO 
CONSULT WITH COMMANDS TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE VICTIM RESPONSE AND CARE, 
AND ARE NOW USING AN AUTOMATED CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (CMS) TO CAPTURE 
VICTIM DATA AND ENSURECOMPREHENSIVE SUPPORT.  EQUALLY IMPORTANT, 
MEDICAL PERSONNEL AND CHAPLAINS HAVE DEVELOPED SPECIALIZED TRAINING 
THAT PREPARES THEM TO CARE FOR AND SUPPORT VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.  
SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EXAMINATION (SAFE) KITS ARE ALSO NOW AVAILABLE 
WORLD WIDE.

5.  ACCOUNTABILITY.  FOSTERING A CULTURE AND COMMAND CLIMATE IN WHICH 
PREDATORS CANNOT OPERATE IS AN ALL HANDS EFFORT.  THE JUDGE ADVOCATE 
GENERAL (OJAG) HAS HIRED TWO SEXUAL ASSAULT LITIGATION SPECIALISTS, AND 
IS PROVIDING SPECIALIZED TRAINING TO THE JAG CORPS TO LITIGATE 
SEXUALASSAULT CASES, ENSURING BALANCED PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE.  
ADDITIONALLY, OJAG IS PARTNERING WITH NAVAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE 
SERVICE (NCIS) TO CONDUCT JOINT REVIEWS OF OVER 50 CLOSED CASES TO 
IDENTIFY CRITICAL, POST-INCIDENT FEEDBACK PROTOCOLS FOR 
ACCOUNTABILITYAND PROCESS IMPROVEMENT.

6.  SELF-ASSESSMENT.  A SAPR CROSS FUNCTIONAL TEAM WAS ESTABLISHED, AS 
OUTLINED IN REF C, AND CONTINUES TO MEET WEEKLY TO EVALUATE, DEVELOP 
AND IMPROVE NAVY'S POLICIES, PROGRAMS AND PROCEDURES.

7.  TRAINING.  TO ENHANCE SAILORS' AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF 
NAVY'S SAPR PROGRAM, A PRACTICAL APPLICATION MODULE HAS BEEN ADDED TO 
SUPPLEMENTTHE BASIC KNOWLEDGE MODULE IN GENERAL MILITARY TRAINING (GMT).  
GMT CAN BE ACCESSED BY LOGGING ON TO NAVY KNOWLEDGE ONLINE
(NKO) AT HTTP://WWWA.NKO.NAVY.MIL/.  SEXUAL HARASSMENT QUESTIONS HAVE 
BEEN ADDED TO THE MARCH 2010 ADVANCEMENT EXAMS AND WILL ALSO BE ADDED 
TO THE 2011 EXAM.

8.  SEXUAL ASSAULT UNDERMINES THE MORALE, UNIT COHESION AND OPERATIONAL 
READINESS OF THE TOTAL FORCE.  AN ATTACK ON A SHIPMATE IS AN ATTACK 
AGAINST US ALL.  WE HAVE THE POWER AND RESPONSIBILITY TO INTERVENE 
BEFORE A CRIME OCCURS AND CONTINUE OUR UNIFIED EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE 
THIS CRIME FROM OUR RANKS.  WE SEEK YOUR FEEDBACK AS WE WORK TOGETHER 
TO REDUCE SEXUAL ASSAULTS.
