SUBJ/UNIFORM UPDATE// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN SUPERSEDES NAVADMIN 351/06 AND ANNOUNCES THE 
REVISED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR THE NEW E1 THROUGH O10 NAVY WORKING 
UNIFORM (NWU), THE E1 THROUGH E6 YEAR-ROUND SERVICE UNIFORM (SU), AND 
THE NAVY PHYSICAL TRAINING UNIFORM (PTU).  THIS IS THE FOURTH IN A 
SERIES OF MESSAGES INTENDED TO INFORM AND PREPARE SAILORS FOR THE 
INTRODUCTION OF NEW UNIFORMS.
2.  DUE TO RECENT CONTRACTING AND VARIOUS UNIFORM COMPONENT PRODUCTION 
AND MANUFACTURING CHALLENGES, THE INTRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION 
SCHEDULE FOR THE SU AND NWU IS REVISED.  TO ENSURE SAILORS ARE PROVIDED 
QUALITY UNIFORMS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES COMMENSURATE WITH THE 24 
MONTH ROLLOUT PLAN AND TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF ANY 
UNFORESEEN PRODUCTION DISCREPANCIES, THE INITIAL INTRODUCTION AND 
DISTRIBUTION OF NEW NAVY UNIFORMS WILL OCCUR BY REGION OVER A 
DESIGNATED PERIOD OF TIME RATHER THAN SIMULTANEOUS MULTIPLE SITE 
DELIVERIES.  THE NEW UNIFORMS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE USING NAVY 
EXCHANGE UNIFORM CENTERS AND TEMPORARY OFF-SITE LOCATIONS UNTIL ALL 
REGIONS HAVE BEEN FULLY OUTFITTED.  OUTFITTING OF ACCESSION COMMANDS 
WILL OCCUR SEPARATELY AND INDEPENDENT OF REGIONAL ROLLOUTS AFTER 
COMMENCEMENT.     
3.  THE INTRODUCTION OF THE SU AND NWU IS SCHEDULED AS FOLLOWS:  PHASED 
FLEET AVAILABILITY OF THE SU COMMENCING SUMMER 2008, AND AT RECRUIT 
TRAINING COMMAND (RTC) BEGINNING FY09; PHASED FLEET AVAILABILITY OF THE 
NWU COMMENCING WINTER 2008 AND AT RTC IN SPRING OF 2009.  EACH UNIFORM 
PROGRAM ROLLOUT IS SCHEDULED FOR 24 MONTHS RESPECTIVELY.  THE SEQUENCE 
AND TIMELINE FOR RESPECTIVE ROLLOUTS WILL BE ANNOUNCED VIA SEPARATE 
CORRESPONDENCE. 
4.  THE INTRODUCTION OF THE PHYSICAL TRAINING UNIFORM (PTU) IS 
SCHEDULED AS FOLLOWS:  PHASED FLEET AND RTC AVAILABILITY COMMENCING 
SPRING 2008.  THE PTU ROLLOUT WILL OCCUR OVER A SIX MONTH PERIOD AND 
WILL BE DISTRIBUTED INCREMENTALLY TO DESIGNATED REGIONS.  SEQUENCE AND 
TIMELINE FOR ROLLOUTS WILL BE ANNOUNCED VIA SEPARATE CORRESPONDENCE. 
5.  THE REVISED UNIFORM INTRODUCTION PROVIDES FOR MORE LOGISTICAL 
FLEXIBILITY DURING THE UNIFORM PHASE-IN PROCESS, ENSURES THE NEW 
UNIFORMS CONFORM TO FLEET STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS, AND FACILITATES 
THE PHASING OUT OF UNIFORMS SLATED FOR REPLACEMENT/DELETION.  DURING 
THE SU AND NWU 24 MONTH PHASE-IN PERIOD BOTH CURRENT AND NEW UNIFORMS 
WILL BE AUTHORIZED FOR WEAR.  CLOTHING REPLACEMENT ALLOWANCE INCREASES 
PROVIDED IN FY08 AND FY09 ARE DESIGNED TO FACILITATE PURCHASE OF THESE 
NEW UNIFORMS WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE.  ALL SAILORS ARE REMINDED TO 
BUDGET AND PREPARE PROPERLY FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE NEW UNIFORM 
REQUIREMENTS UPON AVAILABILITY.
6.  NAVY UNIFORM REGULATIONS WILL BE REVISED TO REFLECT NEW UNIFORM 
POLICY GUIDANCE REGARDING MANNER AND OCCASIONS FOR WEAR.  A COMPLETELY 
REVISED UNIFORM REGULATION MANUAL WILL BE ISSUED PRIOR TO THE ROLLOUT 
OF NEW UNIFORMS. 
7.  ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE ROLLOUT OF THE NEW UNIFORMS AND OTHER 
UNIFORM INITIATIVES WILL BE ANNOUNCED VIA FUTURE NAVADMINS AND POSTED
