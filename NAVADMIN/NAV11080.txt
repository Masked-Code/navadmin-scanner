RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE FY10 SHIP ENERGY CONSERVATION AWARDS IAW 
REF A.  ALTHOUGH THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR OVER A DECADE, IT HAS 
TAKEN ON INCREASED SIGNIFICANCE SINCE 2009 WHEN REF B ANNOUNCED SECNAV'S 
DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY ENERGY TARGETS AND ESTABLISHED NEW OVERALL GOALS FOR 
UTILIZING ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES, ENERGY CONSERVATION, AND EFFICIENCY.  
ENERGY CONSERVATION
(ENCON) IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF ENERGY SECURITY, AND ONE OF SECNAV'S TOP 
PRIORITIES.  CREATING AN ENCON CULTURE THAT CONSIDERS ENERGY USE AS WE OPERATE 
ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS IS ESSENTIAL TO A SECURE ENERGY FUTURE AND ACHIEVEMENT 
OF SECNAV'S GOALS.

2.  THE ENERGY CONSERVATION AWARDS PROGRAM PROMOTES EXCELLENCE IN ENERGY 
CONSERVATION AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY.  
RECOGNITION WILL BE GIVEN FOR OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY MANAGEMENT, 
INNOVATIONS IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND ENERGY CONSERVING 
APPROACHES TO TRAINING, DAILY OPERATIONS, HOUSEKEEPING, AND MAINTENANCE.  THIS 
PROGRAM ALSO REINFORCES NAVY'S LEADERSHIP AS AN OUTSTANDING STEWARD OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT.

3.  ALL SHIPS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM AS AN 
EFFECTIVE MEANS OF PROMOTING INNOVATIVE AND EFFECTIVE ENERGY MANAGEMENT WITHIN 
THE NAVY.  THE INTENT IS TO RECOGNIZE ACHIEVEMENTS AT THE UNIT LEVEL.  THE TWO 
CATEGORIES OF AFLOAT UNITS ELIGIBLE FOR TACTICAL ENERGY AWARDS ARE:
    A.  LARGE SHIPS (CREW OF 400 OR MORE)
    B.  SMALL SHIPS (CREW OF LESS THAN 400) 

4.  THE FOLLOWING FOUR FUNCTIONAL AREAS WILL BE WEIGHTED AS THE AWARD CRITERIA 
FOR SHIPS.
    A.  TOTAL ENERGY SAVED (55 POSSIBLE POINTS):  TOTAL ENERGY
    SAVED IN FY10 AS CALCULATED IN BARRELS AND DOLLARS, COMPARED TO
    PRIOR YEAR ENCON BASELINES FOR UNDERWAY, NOT UNDERWAY, AND GAINS
    /LOSSES BY INVENTORY.  THE ENCON BASELINES ARE BASED ON A
    PREVIOUS THREE-YEAR NAVY ENERGY USAGE REPORTING SYSTEM (NEURS)
    HISTORICAL AVERAGE.  THERE IS A ONE YEAR LAG BETWEEN BASELINES
    AND CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE FY10 BASELINE YEARS
    ARE FY08, FY07, AND FY06.  SHIPS MAY VIEW THEIR CLASS AVERAGE
    BASELINE FOR FY10 AND QUARTERLY FUEL REPORTS AT THE ENCON
    WEBSITE HTTP://WWW.I-ENCON.COM.  SHIPS SHOULD USE THESE FUEL
    PERFORMANCE REPORTS TO DETERMINE TOTAL ENERGY SAVINGS.  PROVIDE
    A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ACTIONS TAKEN TO ACHIEVE THE SAVINGS
    IDENTIFIED.  SHIPS MAY USE THE ENCON CHECKLIST POSTED ON THE
    WEBSITE AS A GUIDE.  OPERATIONAL SAVINGS ACHIEVED BY OPERATING
    YOUR SHIP MORE EFFICIENTLY BOTH UNDERWAY AND NOT UNDERWAY ARE
    PRIMARY AWARD CRITERIA.
    B.  COLD IRON ENERGY SAVED (10 POSSIBLE POINTS):  UP TO 10
    POINTS WILL BE AWARDED FOR DOCKSIDE SHORE POWER (COLD IRON)
    ENERGY SAVINGS ACHIEVED BY REDUCING HOTEL LOAD DEMANDS, WHILE
    OPTIMIZING COLD-IRON SUPPORT.  PROVIDE A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF
    ACTIONS TAKEN TO ACHIEVE THE SAVINGS IDENTIFIED.  SINCE ONLY
    NAVAL BASE SAN DIEGO HAS INDIVIDUAL SHIP KW METERING, SHIPS AT
    OTHER LOCATIONS CAN QUALIFY FOR THE FULL 10 PTS BY THE
    DOCUMENTING THE ENCON ACTIONS TAKEN WHILE ON SHORE POWER AND
    PROVIDING KW LOAD DATA BEFORE AND AFTER INSTITUTING THE ENCON
    MEASURES.

    MATERIALS, SUCH AS GUIDES AND SHIPBOARD ENERGY CONSERVATION
    ASSISTANCE TRAINING (SECAT) SOFTWARE.  SHIPS WILL RECEIVE UP TO
    15 POINTS FOR ATTENDANCE AT ENCON SEMINARS AND WORKSHOPS
    CONDUCTED VIA VIDEO TELETRAINING (VTT), OR ONSITE TRAINING AT
    MAJOR NAVAL BASES.  (THE VTT SCHEDULE AND ON SITE TRAINING WILL
    BE POSTED ON THE ENCON WEBSITE.)  XO/CHENG ATTENDANCE EARNS 10
    PTS; MPA/OTHER DEPARTMENT HEADS 3 PTS; AND OIL KING 2
    PTS.  ALSO, CO ATTENDANCE WILL BE USED AS A TIE BREAKER.  SECOND
