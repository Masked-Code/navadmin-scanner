SUBJ/NAVY FAMILY OMBUDSMAN APPRECIATION DAY// 

GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  ON BEHALF OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY, 
I EXTEND MY PERSONAL THANKS TO THE THOUSANDS OF DEDICATED NAVY FAMILY 
OMBUDSMEN FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND SERVICE IN SUPPORT OF OUR SAILORS AND THEIR 
FAMILIES AT HOME AND AROUND THE GLOBE.

2.  YOUR CONTINUED EFFORTS AND SUPPORT ALLOW OUR SAILORS TO FOCUS ON THEIR 
MISSION, KNOWING THAT THEIR FAMILIES AT HOME HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED.

3.  WE LIVE IN CHALLENGING TIMES WHERE INFORMATION FLOWS FAST AND CAN 
SOMETIMES BECOME CONFUSING. OUR NAVY OMBUDSMEN KEEP THE FLOW OF COMMUNICATION 
OPEN BETWEEN COMMANDS AND OUR FAMILIES.  WITH OUR NAVY OPERATING AT A 
DEMANDING PACE, OMBUDSMEN PROVIDE THE GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT FROM GLOBAL SUPPORT 
TO SAILORS, TO DISASTER RELIEF, AND SURGE DEPLOYMENTS.

4.  ON SEPTEMBER 14TH, WE RECOGNIZE THE FUNDAMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE 
DEDICATED VOLUNTEERS.  THEIR MISSION IS CRITICAL TO OUR NAVY'S SUCCESS.  I 
ENCOURAGE ALL COMMANDS TO HOST EVENTS THAT CONVEY OUR GRATITUDE AND 
APPRECIATION.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM, VISIT THE 
NAVY FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTER WEB SITE AT WWW.NFFSP.ORG 

5.  AGAIN, THANK YOU TO ALL THE OMBUDSMEN FOR CONTINUING TO SERVE AND SUPPORT 
OUR NAVY FAMILY.  YOUR MISSION IS VITAL AS WE CONTINUE TO BE A GLOBAL FORCE 
FOR GOOD.  WE WISH YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES ALL THE BEST ON THIS OMBUDSMAN 
APPRECIATION DAY.
