RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the guidance for the administration 
of the Spring 2022 (cycle 110) Navy-wide Advancement Exam (NWAE) for 
Selected Reserve (SELRES) E-5 through E-7 and E-4 Prior Service 
Reenlistment Eligibility Reserve (PRISE-R) candidates, and the use 
of an alternative final multiple score rank-order method without an 
exam for all other SELRES E-4 advancement candidates.  As a 
continued safety measure during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 
19) outbreak, E-4 exams (with the exception of PRISE-R) have been 
cancelled and an expanded testing window has been established for E- 
4 PRISE-R, E-5 and E-6 candidates.  E-7 candidates will complete 
their exams from 1-28 February in order to meet deadlines for the 
chief selection boards.  These expanded testing windows will allow 
for smaller groups of test takers, ensuring adequate social 
distancing can be maintained between Sailors at testing facilities, 
while maintaining the high standards and continued culture of 
learning that drive our enlisted advancement system.  Information 
pertaining to selection board criteria will be promulgated via a 
future NAVADMIN.  All candidates serving as a voluntary recall, on a 
mobilization or as a Canvasser Recruiter (CANREC) will compete for 
advancement as a SELRES.

3.  Eligibility Requirements.  For all E-4 through E-7 candidates, 
eligibility requirements are found in chapter 2 of reference (a), 
with the following information specific only to cycle 110: 
    a.  The terminal eligibility date used to compute time-in-rate 
(TIR) for E-4 through E-6 is 1 July 2022 and for E-7 is 1 January 
2023. 
    b.  The minimum TIR date must be on or before: 
        (1) E-7 - 1 January 2020 
        (2) E-6 - 1 July 2019 
        (3) E-5 - 1 July 2021 
        (4) E-4 - 1 January 2022 
    c.  E-6 and E-7 candidate TIR requirements for early promote 
(EP) Sailors can be waived by one year with commanding officer 
(CO)/officer-in-charge (OIC) approval, in line with paragraph 214 of 
reference (a).  NOTE: Cycle 110 EAW must be manually created for all 
E-6 and E-7 EP TIR waiver authorized candidates. 
    d.  High-year tenure (HYT) date for E-4 through E-6 must be 
effective 1 July 2022 or later.  HYT date for E-7 must be effective 
1 September 2022 or later.  Any HYT waiver must be approved prior to 
1 February 2022 to be able to participate in cycle 110. 
    e.  Candidates who have submitted a formal written request for 
voluntary transfer to the retired reserve (with or without pay) or 
Fleet Reserve on a date prior to their mandated-HYT are ineligible 
for advancement. 
    f.  Candidates in a rating requiring a security clearance must 
have a favorable investigation adjudication by the Department of 
Defense consolidated adjudication facility reflected properly in the 
Defense Information System for Security (DISS) prior to 1 February 
2022.  If the CO/OIC of the candidate grants an interim clearance, 
it must be entered in DISS prior to 1 February 2022.  Candidates 
must maintain security clearance eligibility throughout the 
advancement cycle to be eligible for advancement.  If for any reason 
a clearance is denied, revoked or not reflected in DISS, an exam is 
not authorized and commands will not allow candidates to take the 
exam until the discrepancy is corrected or a new clearance is 
granted and is properly reflected in the candidates EAW.  Ratings 
requiring a security clearance are:  AC, AE, AG, AO, AT, AWF, AWO, 
AWR, AWS, AZ, CTI, CTN, CTR, CTT, EOD, ET, ETV, FC, FCA, GM, HT, IS, 
IT, ITS, LN, MA, MC, MMA, MN, ND, OS, QM, SB, SO, STG, STS, TM and 
YN.  Refer to references (a) and (b) for additional guidance. 
    g.  Branch class and special program indicator (SPI) code.  All 
SELRES including CANREC (with a SPI code of W) are required to take 
the cycle 110 SELRES NWAE. 
    h.  For E-4 and E-5 advancement candidates, compute performance 
mark average (PMA) using all applicable evaluations in the current 
paygrade of the candidate with an ending date that falls within the 
following periods: 
        (1) E-4 - 1 June 2021 to 31 January 2022 
        (2) E-5 - 1 February 2021 to 31 January 2022 
    i.  For E-6 and E-7 advancement candidates, calculate the 
reporting senior cumulative average (RSCA) PMA, as outlined in 
reference (c), using evaluations in the current paygrade of the 
candidate with the ending date that falls within the time periods: 
        (1) E-6 - 1 February 2019 to 31 January 2022 
        (2) E-7 - 1 February 2019 to 31 December 2021 
    j.  Refer to reference (c) and paragraph 308 of reference (a) 
for additional guidance on RSCA PMA and PMA including guidance on 
establishing PMA for new accessions that have graduated from A- 
school and do not have a current evaluation. 
    k.  For guidance on establishing EAW user roles and completing 
worksheets, refer to reference (d).  EAW is mandatory for cycle 110 
and will be the authority for PMA, RSCA PMA and awards. 
    l.  PMK-EE is mandatory for cycle 110 candidates competing for 
advancement, even if no NWAE is being administered and must be 
successfully completed once for the administration paygrade.  The 
PMK-EE completion deadline is 31 December 2021, in line with 
reference (e).  No Sailor competing for advancement shall be 
permitted to participate in the advancement cycle without having 
completed PMK-EE for the administration paygrade. 
    m.  PRISE-R Sailors required to participate in the NWAE to 
complete their rate conversion are only required to complete the 
PMK-EE if they are an E-3 and are eligible for advancement in 
conjunction with testing to complete rate conversion. 
    n.  Commands must accurately validate, complete and finalize all 
EAWs in the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System.  E-4 EAW 
accuracy is critical since Navy Enlisted Advancement System (NEAS) 
will be reprogrammed to use finalized E-4 EAWs (with the exception 
of PRISE-R) rather than the candidate exam answer sheets to create 
E-4 candidate records.  The success of this process will be 
dependent upon the accurate completion of E-4 EAWs to establish 
advancement cycle participation. 
 
4.  Exam Ordering.  Order exams in line with chapter 4 of reference 
(a). 
    a.  Deploying commands and candidates departing to 
congressionally-designated combat zones and approved contingency 
operations areas (CDCZ/ACOA) can order exams up to six months prior 
to the scheduled exam date.  For additional guidance, refer to 
chapter 4 and paragraph 614 of reference (a). 
    b.  Sensitive compartmented information (SCI) Exams. 
Cryptologic technician interpretive (CTI), cryptologic technician 
networks (CTN) and cryptologic technician collection (CTR) SCI exam 
ordering dates can be found on the NEAS website via MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/command-
information.  Select Command Advancement Tools, then NEAS Website. 
Educational Services Officers (ESOs) must verify initial TIR 
eligibility lists on the NEAS website for exam ordering. 
Supplemental SCI exams are ordered via message formatted e-mail to 
sfly_cryptologic.products(at)navy.mil or naval message following the 
guidelines in line with chapter 4 of reference (a).  The deadline 
for additional orders is 4 January 2022. 
    c.  Non-SCI Exams.  Exam ordering dates can be found on the NEAS 
website via MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/command-
information.  Select Command Advancement Tools, then NEAS Website. 
ESOs must verify TIR eligibility lists on the NEAS website during 
the following time periods: 
        (1) Initial exam ordering for non-SCI exams will be 
available from 28 November to 12 December 2021. 
        (2) Eligible candidates who were not added to the initial 
TIR list can be added to a supplemental TIR list.  Supplemental TIR 
lists will be available from 13 December 2021 to 18 January 2022. 
The deadline to order supplemental SELRES exams is 28 February 2022. 
    d.  Exams ordered after the TIR lists have closed and exams for 
PRISE-R Sailors shall be ordered using message formatted e-mail or 
naval message following the guidelines in chapter 4 of reference 
(a).  Ensure a point of contact is included in the submitted e-mail 
or message. 
    e.  Exams for CDCZ/ACOA Sailors or recalled reservists will be 
ordered by the command holding the service record of the Service 
Member.  Authority is granted for these candidates to be 
administered exams with the Active-Duty exam administration. 
However, SELRES, including CANREC candidates, are still required to 
take the cycle 110 SELRES exam and not the cycle 254 (E-7) or cycle 
255 (E-4 through E-6) Active-Duty exam. 
    f.  When an exam is not used during the normally scheduled 
timeline, do not destroy the exam prior to 1 April 2022.  Refer to 
paragraphs 4.f.(1) and 4.f.(2) below for requests to retain exams 
for late administration on the next drill weekend in March 2022. 
Approved late administrations must be administered prior to 1 April 
2022. 
        (1) Since SELRES candidates may take the NWAE anytime from 1 
February 2022 to 14 March 2022, except for E-7 candidates who must 
take it in February, annual training (AT) and additional duty for 
training (ADT) orders are not valid reasons for any Sailors to take 
the late exam.  ESOs shall ensure that Sailors take the NWAE prior 
to going on AT/ADT orders or when Sailors return from their AT/ADT. 
If a Sailor will be on AT/ADT during the entire time of the 
scheduled advancement exam window, then the ESO shall coordinate 
with the gaining command to forward the Sailors exam and EAW. 
        (2) Naval Education and Training Professional Development 
Center (NETPDC (N321)) has the final approval for all late exam 
administration requests, but all SELRES late exam requests must come 
through the Navy Reserve force ESOs prior to contacting NETPDC.  The 
command ESO must e-mail the Navy Reserve Force ESOs at 
CNRFC_Reserve_Forces_ESO(at)navy.mil and carbon copy their immediate 
superior in command ESOs for validation of their late exam 
administration request.  Once the Reserve Force ESOs validate the 
reason of the request, the command ESO will request approval from 
NETPDC to allow the Sailor to take the late exam.  A request for 
approval from NETPDC must be submitted with justification via e-mail 
to sfly_N321_exam_order(at)navy.mil for authorization to retain 
exams for late administration on the next drill weekend in March 
2022.  Ensure the reason for a requested delay and Commander, Navy 
Reserve Forces Command ESO validation is included. 
    g.  ESOs must verify the exam orders at the *View Previous Exam Orders* 
link via the NEAS website within 7 to 10 days of placing the order.  If exam 
order discrepancies are noted, contact the Fleet Services Branch NETPDC 
(N321) as listed on the NEAS website in the NETPDC (N321) Point of Contact 
Table. 
 
5.  Exam Administration and Answer Sheet Returns 
    a.  SELRES E-5 through E-6 and E-4 PRISE-R exam administrations will 
occur from 1 February through 14 March 2022.  SELRES E-7 exam administrations 
will occur from 1 through 28 February 2022. Administration for all late exams 
will follow guidelines in reference (a) and paragraph 4.f. of reference (b). 
    b.  Every effort should be made to spread the administration of 
the exams evenly throughout the exam administration period, in order 
to minimize the number of exam-takers at any one administration to 
ensure maximum social distancing. 
    c.  All commands should develop a plan to meet COVID-19 
mitigations.  Every effort should be made to ensure appropriate COVID-19 
mitigation measures are in place, to include, but not limited to, face 
coverings, adequate social distancing, available hand sanitizer, medical 
(questionnaire) screenings and temperature checks. 
    d.  Following the administration of exams, it is critical that 
ESOs expeditiously mail in answer sheet packages to NETPDC (N321). 
Do not hold exams until the end of the testing window.  Prompt 
return of answer sheets will help ensure results are released in a 
timely manner.  For answer sheet return instructions, refer to 
chapter 6 of reference (a). 
    e.  ESOs must check the exam toteboard on the NEAS website often 
to ensure answer sheets have been received and processed.  The 
toteboard can be accessed via MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/command-
information.  Select Command Advancement Tools, then Exam Toteboard. 
Erroneous answer sheets that will not be counted until they are 
processed successfully. 
 
6.  Discrepancy Correction 
    a.  A detailed discrepancy list can be found at the NEAS website 
via MyNavy Portal.  For guidance on discrepancy correction 
requirements, refer to chapters 3 and 7 of reference (a). 
    b.  Post-exam administration discrepancy correction 
correspondence with NETPDC (N321) is to be submitted using the EAW post-exam 
administration comments (PAC) function, refer to reference (e).  All 
corrections must have a CO/OIC letter and all required supporting 
documentation included as attachments.  Education point corrections require a 
submission of the Joint Service Transcript indicating the degree type and 
date of completion. 
    c.  For guidance on E-4 through E-6 candidates with missed exams due to 
assignment in CDCZ/ACOA, refer to chapter 6 of reference (a). A missed exam 
cycle EAW is required to be completed by selecting *Missed Cycle/Individual 
Augmentee* entry in the *EAW Special Circumstances* data entry field. 
    d.  Selection Board Eligibility Waivers 
        (1) CDCZ/ACOA Candidates.  As an additional enclosure to cycle 110 
letter of transmittal, commands with CDCZ/ACOA candidates should submit a 
list of selection board eligible candidates by activity as an additional 
enclosure with cycle 110 E-7 Letter of Transmittal.  This is a change to 
paragraph 614.f.(5) of reference (a). 
        (2) Non-CDCZ/ACOA Candidates.  Submit message formatted e-mail 
exception to policy for selection board eligibility waiver directly to 
Enlisted Plans and Policy Branch (OPNAV N132C) at NXAG_N132C(at)navy.mil, per 
paragraph 104 of reference (a).  This is a change to paragraph 614.f.(5) of 
reference (a). 
 
7.  NWAE Results.  Selection board eligibility results will be provided via 
Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS) On-line to authorized command 
representatives prior to release of profile sheets.  See chapter 7 of 
reference (a) for additional information on selection board eligibility and
