RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN issues Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 general military 
training (GMT) requirements for all Navy Service Members.  These 
requirements are mandated by Congress and the Department of Defense 
in line with references (a) through (i).  In the competition with 
our pacing challenge, the individual readiness of our people is our 
warfighting advantage.  This GMT provides sailors baseline training 
to protect fellow sailors from harm, protect our operations, and 
protect our networks and information-key tenets that make us better 
warfighters. 
 
2.  In response to Fleet feedback, Navy has minimized mandatory GMT 
topics.  In all cases, commanders are expected to use their judgment 
to tailor GMT to best meet the needs of their command and ensure 
critical concepts resonate in a way that makes us better.
