SUBJ/CNO GUIDANCE TO THE FLEET - FRAGMENTARY ORDER 01/2019:
A DESIGN FOR MAINTAINING MARITIME SUPERIORITY//

RMKS/1.  Our Navy's strategic direction, focused on Great Power Competition, 
is sound.  This Fragmentary Order is written for senior Navy leaders to 
simplify, prioritize and build on the foundation of Design 2.0, issued in 
December 2018.

2.  We will focus our efforts toward Warfighting, Warfighters, and the Future 
Navy.

3.  Modern naval operations are in rapid transition, demanding the 
integrated, multi-domain capabilities of our fleets.  We will respond to this 
transition with urgency.

4.  Combined with a robust constellation of allies and partners who desire to 
build and strengthen the international economic order, we are operating 
towards the same end - continued security and stability that results in a 
free and open maritime commons.  We will continue to partner and stand 
shoulder-to- shoulder with all nations who share a mutual respect for and 
adherence to international law as well as a vision of free and open maritime 
commons.

5.  Together with the United States Marine Corps, our Navy is the bedrock of 
Integrated American Naval Power, a force capable of fulfilling the mandate of 
the National Defense Strategy and the National Military Strategy.

6.  I am confident that we will maximize the Navy we have today while 
delivering the Navy that our Nation will rely upon tomorrow.
