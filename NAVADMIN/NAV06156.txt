RMKS/1.   REF A IS CNO NAVADMIN HIGHLIGHTING THIS YEARS BATTLE OF
MIDWAY COMMEMORATION.
2.  THIS YEAR FROM 1-4 JUNE, WE WILL MARK THE 64TH ANNIVERSARY

OF MIDWAY. ON JUNE 4TH, 1942, A VASTLY OUTNUMBERED U.S. FLEET WOULD

ATOLL NAMED MIDWAY.
3. IT IS FITTING THAT WE TAKE A MOMENT TO CELEBRATE OUR NAVAL
HERITAGE AND REMEMBER THE DEEDS AND SACRIFICES OF THOSE BRAVE PILOTS
AND SAILORS. I CAN'T HELP BUT COMPARE THE RAW COURAGE AND
DETERMINATION OF THE SAILORS AND MARINES OF MIDWAY TO THOSE FIGHTING
TODAY IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, THE PERSIAN GULF, AND A MYRIAD OF OTHER
PLACES AROUND THE WORLD, STILL PROTECTING FREEDOM TO THIS DAY. THE
GREATEST HONOR WE CAN GIVE THOSE WHO FOUGHT AND WON THE BATTLE OF
MIDWAY IS TO KEEP DOING THE REMARKABLE JOB EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU
ARE DOING TODAY. THEIR HEROISM AND DEEDS LIVE ON TODAY AND ARE
REFLECTED IN OUR CORE VALUES OF HONOR, COURAGE AND COMMITMENT. I
HIGHLY ENCOURAGE ALL COMMANDS TO COMMEMORATE THE BATTLE OF MIDWAY IN
A MANNER THEIR MISSIONS WILL ALLOW.
