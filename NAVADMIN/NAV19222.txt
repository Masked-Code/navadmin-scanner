12-STAR MESSAGE ON SUICIDE PREVENTION  THERE ARE NO BYSTANDERS//

RMKS/1.  As we approach the end of suicide prevention awareness month for 
2019, we must acknowledge the sobering fact that we are losing our shipmates 
to suicide at an increasing rate.  A new approach to our Operational Stress 
Control (OSC) program is critical to reversing this trend.  Every day, we 
each play a part in creating a supporting environment where those who need 
help have the courage to seek help.

2.  I applaud our hard work to date, but the approach we have been taking is 
not enough.  Leadership must make the mental and physical well-being of our 
Sailors a priority and get actively involved in resiliency programs.  Sailors 
must be constantly on the lookout for uncharacteristic behavior, and are 
encouraged to support their shipmates and step forward to report what they 
see.  We are the eyes and ears on the deckplates and the first line of 
defense.  To properly train everyone for this critical fight, a fight we must 
wage 24/7, our Command Resilience Teams (CRTs) must take a new approach to 
how they do business with leadership engaged for every Sailor, every day.

3.  This NAVADMIN announces an OSC program policy update.  Effective 1 
October 2019:
    a.  An Expanded Operational Stress Control (E-OSC) program will inform, 
empower and encourage the Navy community of Sailors, civilians and their 
families to identify signs of stress within themselves and others and know 
where to turn for help.  The E-OSC will leverage CRTs and deckplate 
leadership to provide more accessible, collaborative resources and real-time 
assessments of unit culture to promote healthy command climates and mitigate 
risks.
    b.  As we will simplify and align our efforts to gain the best support 
for our Sailors and their families, we can no longer just conduct OSC 
training prior to deployment.  We must change our culture and actions to 
promote excellence for every Sailor, every day.  Therefore, the OSC pre- 
deployment training requirement outlined in reference (a) is cancelled.
Specifically, Navy Operational Stress ControlLeader (NAVOSC-LEAD) and 
Deckplate Leader Operational Stress Control (DPL-OSC) courses as previously 
conducted by the OSC Mobile Training Teams are no longer required.
    c.  Instead, we are shifting the OSC training focus to a more 
comprehensive model that uses OSC regardless of deployment status.  The 
expanded focus of OSC and CRTs will target and address the broad range of 
stressors (relationship problems, career transitions, disciplinary/legal 
issues, performance issues and financial strain) that Sailors experience.
The Executive Officer or second senior officer is the Chairman of the CRT, 
with the responsibility to enforce this requirement.
    d.  CRTs monitor, assess and provide recommendations to support and 
connect Sailors to resources to minimize and/or cope with stress.  To aid 
information flow and keep command leadership abreast of the challenges 
impacting Sailors, deckplate leadership shall provide regular reports to the 
CRT including feedback and lessons learned, in line with references (b) 
through (d).

4.  Our CRTs must embrace a new approach as critical enablers of E-OSC by 
adopting principles of Primary Prevention and Human Factors.  This new 
approach will give CRTs greater capability and responsibility to assess the 
overall well-being, morale and stress-level of the command.
    a.  In August 2019, over 200 Command Climate Specialists (CCSs), Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Response Officers (SAPROs), Inclusion and Diversity 
Officers (IDOs), Alcohol and Drug Control Officers (ADCOs), and Suicide 
Prevention Program Managers received initial advanced Human Factors Process 
(Phase I) training.
    b.  CCSs will continue to train CRTs at each command in line with current 
guidance.  CCSs will complete advanced training by 31 March 2020, enabling 
them to train unit-level CRTs to apply prevention principles, Human Factors 
processes and command climate tools. Unit-level CRT training in these 
advanced principles will be completed by June 2020.

5.  Starting TODAY we can all improve our overall command environments and 
reverse our suicide trend.  Commanders, Commanding Officers, and Officers-in- 
Charge, will immediately implement the following requirements:
    a.  Advertise the MyNavyFamily Application in all Welcome Aboard Letters 
and include contact information to the Ombudsman to assist Navy families with 
transitioning.
    b.  Modify Command Indoctrination to include an introduction to the CRT, 
its functions and the essential role of deckplate leadership.
    c.  Post a list of organic and inorganic resources in a common area to 
connect Service Members and their families to supportive services to receive 
help, when needed.
    d.  Add the Command Sponsor Coordinator and Command Indoctrination 
Coordinator as permanent CRT members.
    e.  Within 60 days of the release of this NAVADMIN (or as soon as 
communications allow), each command will be required to report completion and 
compliance with paragraphs 5.a. through 5.d. to their Immediate Superior in 
Command.

6.  The following resources are available for use by leadership / CRTs at all 
levels to assist in cultivating a culture of healthy stress management.
    a.  Deployed Resiliency Counselors (DRCs).
    b.  Embedded Mental Health Providers.
    c.  Navy Dietitian Support to Operational Forces.
