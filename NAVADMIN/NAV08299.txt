SUBJ/UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS BIRTHDAY 2008// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY, I WISH ALL 
MARINES A VERY HAPPY 233RD BIRTHDAY.
2.  SINCE THE FOUNDING OF OUR NAVY AND MARINE CORPS, WE HAVE REPEATEDLY 
ANSWERED OUR NATION'S CALL.  GUADALCANAL, TARAWA, IWO JIMA, AND MIDWAY 
ARE NOT JUST BATTLES IN OUR PAST; THEY DEFINE WHO WE ARE TODAY.  
3.  THE MARINE CORPS IS AT THE TIP OF THE SPEAR, AND ITS FIGHTING 
CAPABILITY IS UNMATCHED ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.  YOUR CONTINUED 
PROFESSIONALISM AND DEDICATION IN TAKING THE FIGHT TO THE ENEMY AROUND 
THE GLOBE MAKES OUR NATION AND OUR WORLD A BETTER PLACE, AND IS THE 
REASON WE USE THE PHRASE, "SEND IN THE MARINES."
4.  AS YOU CELEBRATE THIS SPECIAL DAY, WE HONOR THOSE WHO HAVE MADE THE 
ULTIMATE SACRIFICE, AND IN DOING SO, HAVE FORGED THE FOUNDATION OF OUR 
NAVY AND MARINE CORPS TEAM.  UNITED STATES MARINES ARE THE EPITOME OF 
PROFESSIONALISM AND STRENGTH, AND YOUR FAITHFUL SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY 
HAS INSPIRED GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS.  ON BEHALF OF YOUR NAVY 
SHIPMATES, HAPPY BIRTHDAY AS YOU COMMEMORATE 233 YEARS OF COURAGEOUS 
SERVICE.  THE UNITED STATES NAVY IS PROUD TO SERVE BESIDE YOU.
5.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
