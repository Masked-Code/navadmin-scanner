RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Training 
and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) Aviation Department Head 
Retention Bonus (ADHRB) program in line with references (a) and (b). 
A vital part of developing a total force strategy and maintaining 
combat readiness is to provide appropriate incentives to retain 
skilled personnel for critical Naval Aviation enterprise billets. 
The TAR ADHRB program provides selected bonuses as an incentive to 
eligible pilots and Naval Flight Officers serving in Department Head 
(DH) billets during FY24 and to retain those officers through a 
post-DH aviation staff tour. 
 
2.  The TAR ADHRB program continues the bonus system of previous 
years that is tied directly to force structure and targets initial 
eligible aviators.  Annual DH rates of up to $40K are listed below 
and vary by community.  DH retention bonuses will be paid in three, 
five or seven equal annual installments.  If a signed contract is 
received before completing 12 months of their initial DH tour, the 
Service Member is eligible for the seven year contract beginning on 
their one year anniversary in the DH squadron.  Service Members may 
sign up for the three or five year contract at any time during their 
initial DH tour, but will not be approved until after their one year 
anniversary in the DH squadron.  The following are the monetary 
dollar rates for squadron DH contracts: 
HM - Pilot                   $40K/YR 
HSC - Pilot                  $25K/YR 
HSM - Pilot                  $35K/YR 
HT - Pilot                   $20K/YR 
VAQ - Pilot                  $40K/YR 
VAQ - NFO                    $25K/YR 
VFC - Pilot                  $40K/YR
