SUBJ/NAVY BIRTHDAY 2007// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  AS WE CELEBRATE AND COMMEMORATE THE 232ND BIRTHDAY 
OF OUR NAVY, I THANK ALL WHO ARE SERVING TODAY, MILITARY  AND CIVILIAN; 
TO OUR FAMILIES WHO STAND BY AND SUPPORT US; AND TO  OUR FELLOW SEA 
SERVICE, THE U.S. MARINE CORPS.  WE ARE A GREAT TEAM READY TODAY AND 
PREPARING FOR TOMORROW.
2.  FROM OUR HUMBLE BEGINNING WITH SIX FRIGATES MORE THAN 200 YEARS 2.  
FROM OUR HUMBLE BEGINNING WITH SIX FRIGATES MORE THAN 200 YEARS AGO, WE 
HAVE BECOME THE MOST DOMINANT AND INFLUENTIAL NAVAL FORCE EVER TO SAIL 
THE WORLD'S OCEANS.  WE ENSURE FREEDOM OF THE SEAS, PROJECT POWER IN 
SUPPORT OF NATIONAL INTERESTS AND SUPPORT ALLIES AND PARTNERS AROUND 
THE WORLD.  WE ARE AT ONCE POWERFUL, YET COMPASSIONATE WHEN REACHING 
OUT TO OTHERS IN NEED.  WHILE THE TOOLS OF OUR PROFESSION; SHIPS, 
AIRPLANES, AND SUBMARINES ARE IMPRESSIVE; THEY ARE OF LITTLE WORTH 
WITHOUT OUR PEOPLE WHO GIVE THEM VALUE.  IT IS YOU, EVERY SAILOR, NAVY 
CIVILIAN, AND FAMILY MEMBER SERVING AROUND THE WORLD OR HERE AT HOME, 
WHO TRULY KEEPS OUR FLEET ON A STEADY COURSE TODAY, AND SETS THE COURSE 
FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.
 YOUR COMMITMENT TO SERVICE AND INDIVIDUAL READINESS MAKES US THE NAVY 
WE MUST BE.  ON DUTY AND OFF, YOU ARE THE FACE OF OUR NAVY AND NATION.
3.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SHIPMATES.  I AM PROUD OF WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU 
DO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND THAT OF YOUR FAMILIES.
4.  ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
