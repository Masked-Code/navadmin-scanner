This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the Spring Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 
Full-Time Support (FTS) Officer Transfer and Redesignation Board on 30 March 
2020.  Applications from qualified Active Component (AC) and Selected Reserve 
(SELRES) officers will be considered by this board.  In line with reference 
(a), this board will also accept applications from FTS officers requesting 
redesignation into another FTS officer community.
2.  Application requirements and procedures can be found via MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning and selecting the FTS 
Redesignation Boards link.  Complete applications with associated enclosures 
must be received no later than (NLT) 2359 on 6 March 2020.
3.  Eligibility
    a.  All applicants must meet eligibility requirements outlined in 
reference (a) and the Spring FY-20 FTS eligibility criteria document found on 
the redesignation website.  Specific eligibility requirements are described 
for each designator and aviation community.  General eligibility criteria 
include projected rotation date (PRD), minimum service requirement (MSR), 
year group (YG) and aviation bonus (AvB) contracts.
        (1) PRD.  Applicants should have a PRD NLT 31 October 2021.
Waiver requests will need to be endorsed by your commanding officer
(CO) with your application.
        (2) MSR.  AC applicants should have completed their MSR prior to 31 
October 2021.  Waiver requests (no additional documentation required by the 
applicant) will be considered on a case-by-case basis by your AC officer 
community manager (OCM).
        (3) AvB.  Aviation officers with obligated service as a result of AvB 
are eligible to apply if the officer will be within 12 months of completing 
AvB obligation or department head tour at the time the board convenes.  
Redesignation immediately following a department head tour may result in the 
cancellation of AvB, which will be adjudicated by Aviation Officer 
Assignments.
        (4) Failure of Selection (FOS).  AC officers in a 2xFOS status for 
promotion to lieutenant commander are eligible to apply for FTS regardless of 
MSR and AvB contract term, a waiver request is not required.
        (5) YG.  The approved eligible YGs are posted on the FTS OCM webpage 
along with the remainder of the application data.
    b.  All AC applications will be routed by the FTS OCM through the 
applicable AC OCM for community release prior to applications being sent to 
the board.  Applicants who are not released by the AC OCM will not be 
eligible for the board.  AC officers with a resignation submitted or a 
lieutenant in a 2xFOS status are eligible to apply and do not require AC OCM 
release.
    c.  Limited duty officers are eligible for the FTS program and must 
possess a four-year baccalaureate degree.
    d.  Service Members who do not meet all eligibility requirements in line 
with reference (a) and the Spring FY-20 FTS eligibility criteria document 
posted on the FTS redesignation board website will be pending waiver request 
approval by Head Reserve OCM (BUPERS-35) without any applicant action.  If a 
PRD waiver is required, the CO must acknowledge the request within the 
application endorsement.
4.  Officers applying for multiple designators and/or communities will be 
selected on the needs of the Navy basis and not personal preference.
5.  AC officers will incur a minimum 2 year FTS obligation if selected.  In 
line with references (b) and (c), aviators selected for the Fleet Logistics 
Support Squadron (VR) community will incur a
3 year FTS obligation.  All SELRES officers will incur a 3 year FTS 
obligation regardless of community.  All FTS obligations will begin on the 
date a Service Member redesignates as an FTS Officer unless otherwise stated 
in reference (c).
6.  Upon approval of the board proceedings, the results of the board will be 
posted on the FTS redesignation board website.  Applicants can expect to see 
the results posted within 30 days of board adjournment.  Within 2 weeks of 
the board results being posted, selectees will receive an acceptance package 
and will have 10 days upon receipt to accept or decline FTS 
transfer/redesignation.
