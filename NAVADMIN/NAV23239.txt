RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces Advancement to Warfighting Positions (A2WP) 
Program Phase II for enlisted Selected Reserve (SELRES) Sailors.  This phase 
will commence on 1 October 2023 to coincide with the start of the first 
quarterly MyNavy Assignment (MNA) cycle of Fiscal Year 2024. 
 
2.  Background.  Reference (a) announced A2WP Phase I, which incentivizes 
volunteers for critical individual augmentation mobilizations by coupling 
permanent advancements with select activations.  SELRES Sailors are also 
encouraged to apply for inactive duty training (IDT) billets in operational 
units with preplanned activations.  A2WP Phase II serves as an incentive to 
encourage volunteers to apply for critical IDT billets, connecting permanent 
advancements with these assignments. 
 
3.  Policy.  E-4 and E-5 SELRES Sailors who meet all eligibility requirements 
for advancement to the next higher paygrade (e.g., commanding officer's 
recommendation, time-in-rate (TIR), professional military knowledge 
eligibility exam, etc.) can apply during the quarterly assignment cycle in 
MNA for select IDT billets in operational units one paygrade higher than 
their current rank. 
These select billets will be clearly labeled as authorized for the A2WP 
Program with the "hot jobs" tag.  If selected for the billet, Sailors will 
permanently advance to the next higher paygrade upon reporting to the first 
drill period with their new unit in line with their IDT orders.  Their TIR 
date will be established in line with reference (b). 
    a.  Selected Sailors must obligate through extension or reenlistment to 
complete 60 months of service, within 60 days prior to their IDT orders start 
date.  Any Sailor with an expiration of obligated service date that already 
matches or exceeds the duration of this requirement is not required to incur 
additional service. 
    b.  Selected Sailors must sign an Administrative Remarks (NAVPERS 
1070/613) acknowledging that they will attend the minimum annual IDT periods 
and annual training with their unit.  Sailors must abide by the satisfactory 
participation policy contained in references (d) and (e) and may be subject 
to administrative action per references (c) and (f) if they fail to meet this 
criteria. 
    c.  Sailors who are disqualified for their IDT assignment prior to the 
first drill weekend in their new unit will no longer be eligible for 
advancement under this program. 
    d.  Sailors otherwise eligible for this program, but not in their normal 
projected rotation date window, should discuss options with their current 
chain of command. 
    e.  Sailors in dwell from prior mobilizations are required to sign a 
Voluntary Waiver Acknowledgement for Mobilizing on Active Duty (NAVPERS 
1300/25) to be eligible for this program, as participating units may have 
preplanned activations scheduled. 
 
4.  A2WP Phase II quotas.  The number of quotas available depends on the 
warfighting readiness of operational units and the community health of 
corresponding SELRES ratings.  With support from the Director, Military 
Personnel Plans and Policy (OPNAV N13), A2WP quotas will be established by 
the Chief of Navy Reserve at least annually. 
 
5.  Selection criteria.  Commander, Navy Reserve Force (CNRFC) will establish 
A2WP Phase II applicant selection criteria and implement a selection process 
to select best and fully qualified applicants. More information will be 
posted on the Navy Reserve Homeport at 
https://www,private.navyreserve.navy.mil/Codes/N1/CNRFC_N121/Pages/NEW_N121_S
ite.aspx.  Navy Reserve Centers and Navy Reserve Activities maintain 
responsibility for ensuring that assigned SELRES Sailors meet advancement 
eligibility requirements. 
 
6.  Additional responsibilities.  CNRFC shall ensure that IDT orders for 
A2WP-selected Sailors include appropriate instructions for Navy Reserve 
Activities to support and process advancements. 
 
7.  Other incentives.  A2WP is designed to supplement and not replace other 
incentive programs.  As such, Sailors selected for A2WP will maintain 
eligibility for other monetary and non-monetary incentives to which they 
would be otherwise entitled in accordance with applicable authorities and 
instructions.  Normally, A2WP Phase II billets will be authorized IDT 
reimbursement funding to best support travel required for these 
positions.  If necessary, OPNAV N13 will adjudicate exceptions to Navy policy 
required to meet the intent of this program. 
 
8.  Points of Contact: 
    a.  For advancement eligibility questions, Sailors should contact their 
Navy Reserve Center or Navy Reserve Activity Educational Services Officer. 
    b.  For specific rate, rating, and Navy enlisted classification questions 
and concerns, Sailors should contact their respective community 
manager.  Contact information can be found on the SELRES Community Manager
