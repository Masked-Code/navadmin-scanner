SUBJ/2014 RAND MILITARY WORKPLACE STUDY// 

NAVADMIN 214/14

MSGID/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/DNS/SEP//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN addresses the 2014 RAND Military Workplace Study.

2.  The study includes a survey that has been sent to all female Active Duty 
and a quarter of all Active Duty males.  The survey asks questions about the 
workplace conditions of our Sailors, and is projected to end on 24 September 
2014.

3.  Navy's participation numbers indicate that our Sailors may not be aware 
of the Survey.  Commanders need to get the word out by letting our Sailors 
know about the RAND Military Workplace Study and its importance to our Navy.  
Sailors should be made aware that the survey is voluntary and confidential.  
No one in DoD will see how an individual Service member responded.

4.  Encourage our Sailors to take the survey, if they have been invited.  
They should remember our core values and have the courage to honestly answer 
the questions.  If Sailors did not receive the survey, but believe they 
should have, they can contact RAND directly via either of the following 
procedures:
    a.  Call the survey help desk at 1-855-365-5914 (OCONUS call collect 240-
453-2620) and the operator will verify your identity, correct the incorrect 
information, and then email the survey information to you.  Hours are 0900-
2359 EST (Monday-Friday),
1000-1800 (Saturday), 1400-2200 (Sunday).  Or:
    b.  Email the help desk at support@randmilitarystudy.org, inform them 
that you have not received your survey information, and provide them a 
contact telephone number with the best time to return your call.  The help 
desk will need to speak to you directly to verify your information and make 
the necessary corrections to participate in the survey.

5.  Point of contact is LT Christopher Hannifan, OPNAV N172, at
(703) 604-6990/DSN 664 or via e-mail at
christopher.hannifan(at)navy.mil.

6.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled.

7.  Released by Vice Admiral S. H. Swift, Director, Navy Staff.//
