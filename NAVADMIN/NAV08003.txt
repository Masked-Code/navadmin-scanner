RMKS/1.  THIS IS THE SECOND OF TWO NAVADMINS UPDATING THE 
BUSINESS RULES ON INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION (IA) 
ASSIGNMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR 
(GWOT).  CURRENTLY, TWO SYSTEMS, THE LEGACY IA MANPOWER 
MANAGEMENT (IAMM) PROCESS AND THE GWOT SUPPORT 
ASSIGNMENTS
(GSA) DETAILING PROCESS OPERATE IN PARALLEL TO MEET NAVY?S 
CONTINGENCY MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS PER REFS A AND B.  THIS 
MESSAGE DESCRIBES THE BUSINESS RULES THAT GOVERN THE GSA 
DETAILING PROCESS,  IMPLEMENTED IN SUMMER 2007, BY WHICH 
THE MAJORITY OF CURRENT AND FUTURE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE 
FILLED. THE FIRST MESSAGE PROVIDED AN UPDATE TO THE IAMM 
PROCESS AND BUSINESS RULES CONTAINED IN REF A.  A FUTURE 
MESSAGE WILL UPDATE SPECIFIC RESERVE COMPONENT GWOT 
ASSIGNMENT BUSINESS RULES.
2.  BACKGROUND.  PER REFS C AND D, IN JUNE 2007 GSA DETAILING 
BEGAN FILLING OVER 1300 CONTINGENCY MANPOWER 
REQUIREMENTS WITH JANUARY 2008 AND LATER REPORT DATES.  
THE PROGRAM EXPANDED IN OCTOBER 2007, BRINGING AN 
ADDITIONAL 2300 REQUIREMENTS INTO THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. 
WITH THIS EXPANSION, GSA DETAILING WILL CAPTURE 
APPROXIMATELY 73 PERCENT OF THE CURRENT REQUIREMENT BY 
MID-TO-LATE CY-2008.  THE GOAL IS TO SHIFT THE REMAINING 27 
PERCENT OF REQUIREMENTS TO THE GSA DETAILING PROCESS AS 
SOON AS PRACTICABLE.  THE PURPOSE OF THE SHIFT IS TO 
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE PREDICTABILITY OF GSA FOR SAILORS AND 
THEIR FAMILIES, ENABLE VOLUNTEERISM, IMPROVE MANNING 
STABILITY AT THE UNIT LEVEL, AND ADD DETAILER INVOLVEMENT 
FOR OVERSIGHT OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND CAREER 
PROGRESSION.  USFF WILL CONTINUE TO FILL A PORTION OF IA 
REQUIREMENTS THROUGH THE IAMM PROCESS UNTIL GSA 
DETAILING IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED.  COMMANDS AND BUDGET 
SUBMITTING OFFICES (BSOS) WILL SEE A REDUCTION IN THE IAMM 
REQUIREMENTS TASKED BY USFF AS THE NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS 
FILLED BY GSA DETAILING INCREASES. OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE AN 
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH GSA ASSIGNMENTS ARE THE NORM, AND 
MID-TOUR IAMM ASSIGNMENTS ARE THE EXCEPTION.
3.  GSA DETAILING ADMINISTRATION.  GSA DETAILING NORMALIZES 
THE PROCESS BY USING THE EXISTING DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM TO 
ADVERTISE AND FILL ACTIVE COMPONENT GWOT SUPPORT 
REQUIREMENTS. SAILORS HAVE THE OPTION TO FILL THESE 
ASSIGNMENTS IN A PREDICTABLE WINDOW AT THEIR REGULAR 
PROJECTED ROTATION DATE (PRD).
    A.  GSA ORDERS.
        (1) ONCE IDENTIFIED FOR A GSA, SAILORS RECEIVE 
PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION (PCS) ORDERS TO EXPEDITIONARY 
COMBAT READINESS CENTER FORWARD SAN DIEGO, CA OR NORFOLK, 
VA.  GSA TOUR LENGTHS MAY VARY, BUT THE STANDARD PCS 
DURATION FOR A GSA IS BETWEEN EIGHT AND 14 MONTHS.
        (2) CONCURRENTLY, SAILORS WILL RECEIVE TDY/ITDY 
ORDERS FROM COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4G3) DETACHING THEM 
FROM ECRC FWD FOR TRAINING, TRANSPORTATION AND 
DEPLOYMENT (OCONUS) IN A TEMPORARY ADDITIONAL DUTY
(TEMADD) STATUS FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION OF PCS ASSIGNMENT. 
SAILORS CAN VIEW TEMADD ORDERS BY LOGGING ON TO BUPERS 
ONLINE (BOL):
             (A) LOG ONTO BUPERS ONLINE AT HTTPS://BOL.NAVY.MIL/.
             (B) SELECT THE "NMCMPS" LINK.
             (C) CLICK "VIEW MY ORDERS" IN UPPER MIDDLE OF THE 
SCREEN.
             (D) VIEW ORDERS.
    B.  GSA TYPE DUTY.  ALL ECRC FWD UICS ARE DESIGNATED TYPE 
TWO SEA DUTY.
    C.  GSA ENTITLEMENTS.  DEPENDENTS SHALL NOT ACCOMPANY 
SERVICE MEMBERS ON THE TEMADD PORTION OF GSA ASSIGNMENTS.  
BASED ON THE ARDUOUS NATURE OF THESE ASSIGNMENTS, GSA 
SAILORS ARE ENTITLED TO MOVE DEPENDENTS TO THE NEW DUTY 
STATION (ECRC SAN DIEGO, CA, OR ECRC NORFOLK, VA, AS
APPROPRIATE) OR TO LEAVE THEM AT THEIR CURRENT PERMANENT 
DUTY STATION (PDS).  DUE TO STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENTS 
WITH HOST NATIONS, MEMBERS AT FOREIGN OCONUS DUTY 
STATIONS MAY NOT BE AUTHORIZED TO LEAVE DEPENDENTS IN 
PLACE AT THE CURRENT PDS.  IF DEPENDENTS STAY AT THE 
FOREIGN OCONUS DUTY STATION, THEY MAY NOT BE COVERED BY 
THE STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT EVEN IF OTHERWISE 
AUTHORIZED TO STAY.  FOR EXAMPLE, A SPOUSE WHO IS A CITIZEN 
OF THE FOREIGN NATION MAY CHOOSE TO STAY AT THE FOREIGN 
DUTY STATION, BUT MAY NOT BE COVERED UNDER THE STATUS OF 
FORCES AGREEMENT ONCE THE SERVICE MEMBER EXECUTES PCS 
OUT OF COUNTRY.  DEPENDENTS REMAINING AT CURRENT DUTY 
STATION ARE ENTITLED TO RETAIN MILITARY HOUSING AND BAH 
ENTITLEMENTS BASED ON CURRENT PDS OR DEPENDENT LOCATION.  
IF GSA ASSIGNMENT EXCEEDS 365 DAYS (PRE-DEPLOYMENT 
TRAINING AND IN THEATER TIME COMBINED), SAILORS MAY ALSO 
QUALIFY FOR A DESIGNATED-PLACE MOVE VIA INDETERMINATE 
TEMPORARY DUTY (ITDY) ORDERS.  CONTACT YOUR DETAILER FOR 
MORE INFORMATION (REF E APPLIES).
    D.  GSA PARENT COMMAND.  ECRC LITTLE CREEK, VA, IS 
DESIGNATED AS THE ECRC FWD ISIC AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GSA 
SAILOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND PERSONNEL SUPPORT (ADMIN, PAY, 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS, ADVANCEMENT, SECURITY 
CLEARANCES, GTCC, ETC.).
    E. GSA PRE-SCREENING REQUIREMENTS.  GSA REQUIRES A 
MEDICAL/DENTAL/ PERSONNEL SUITABILITY SCREENING PER THE 
ECRC CHECKLIST POSTED ON NAVY KNOWLEDGE ONLINE (NKO) AT 
HTTPS://WWW.NKO.NAVY.MIL.  DEPENDENT SCREENING IS NOT 
REQUIRED FOR UNACCOMPANIED ASSIGNMENT FROM THE NEW DUTY 
STATION TO THE OVERSEAS LOCATION.  WHEN SERVICE MEMBER 
SCREENING IS COMPLETE, COMMAND REPRESENTATIVES, WITH 
COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR OR ABOVE ACCESS, SHOULD ENTER 
RESULTS ON BOL USING THE OVERSEAS SCREENING LINK (NOT THE 
IA ASSIGNMENT BUTTON).  COMMANDS WILL PROVIDE 
PSD/PERSONNEL OFFICE WITH THE COMPLETED ECRC CHECKLIST.  
COMPLETED CHECKLIST MUST ALSO BE FORWARDED TO ECRC LITTLE 
CREEK VIA E-MAIL (SUBMIT BUTTON ON THE WEB SITE).  
COMMANDS FAILING TO COMPLETE SCREENING WITHIN THE 30 DAYS 
WILL RECEIVE A DELINQUENT REPORT OF SUITABILITY FOR 
OVERSEAS SCREENING MESSAGE.
    F.  THE GOAL OF GSA DETAILING IS TO NORMALIZE THE IA 
ASSIGNMENT PROCESS. 
OTHER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS EXCEPTIONAL FAMILY 
MEMBERS, DUAL MILITARY COUPLES/SINGLE PARENT ASSIGNMENT 
AND IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER ASSIGNMENT ARE ADDRESSED IN 
EXISTING NAVY POLICIES.
4.  GSA DETAILING BUSINESS RULES.
    A.  BEFORE EACH CMS CYCLE, COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) SHALL 
EXAMINE INCOMING IA DEMAND SIGNAL TO COMPARE SKILL SET 
AND SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS OF EACH GSA 
REQUISITION TO AVAILABLE ROLLERS IN EACH RATING. 
WHEN A LACK OF QUALIFIED ROLLERS NECESSITATES DEVIATING 
FROM RATING SPECIFIED IN A REQUISITION, COMNAVPERSCOM 
(PERS-40) SHALL CONSULT WITH USFF GFM TO SUGGEST SKILL 
SUBSTITUTIONS.  IF SUBSTITUTIONS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE, 
ALTERNATE METHODS TO FILL WILL BE CONSIDERED.
    B.  ALL GSA REQUISITIONS WILL BE LOADED INTO CMS/ID ALONG 
WITH ALL MANDATED SEA DUTY/FLEET READINESS REQUISITIONS.  
USFF, AS MANNING CONTROL AUTHORITY AND AGENCY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR FLEET READINESS, WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE 
PRIORITIZATION INPUT TO ENSURE EQUITABLE ASSIGNMENT OF 
AVAILABLE ASSETS DURING EACH REQUISITION CYCLE.    
COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-40) AND USFF
WILL CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER TO REFINE BUSINESS RULES 
TO OPTIMALLY BALANCE FLEET READINESS AND GSA REQUIREMENTS.    
    C.  GSA ELIGIBLE SAILORS ARE THOSE SAILORS ROLLING FROM 
SEA TO SHORE AND FROM SHORE TO SEA WHO WILL NOT BREAK 
NAVY DWELL/ITEMPO POLICY IF DEPLOYED AND ANY VOLUNTEERS 
FOR A GSA.  EXPECT ENLISTED DETAILERS TO CONTACT ALL GSA- 
QUALIFIED ROLLERS IN THEIR NORMAL NEGOTIATION WINDOW, 
ADVISING THEM OF THE PRIORITY OF GSA ASSIGNMENTS AND THE 
MANY BENEFITS OF APPLYING FOR GSA IN CMS/ID.  IF THERE IS A 
SHORTAGE OF ROLLERS IN THE NORMAL NINE MONTH NEGOTIATION 
WINDOW, DETAILERS MAY CONTACT SAILORS OUT TO 12 MONTHS 
FROM THEIR PRD, SEEKING VOLUNTEERS TO TERMINATE SHORE 
DUTY EARLY TO ACCEPT GSA. 
CONSISTENT WITH NORMAL POLICY, THIS WILL REQUIRE THE 
SAILOR TO SUBMIT A
1306 VIA THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.
    D.  OFFICERS WILL BE CONTACTED BY DETAILERS REGARDING 
POTENTIAL GSA ASSIGNMENTS IN THE NORMAL NEGOTIATION 
WINDOW, WHICH CAN VARY DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE 
REQUIREMENTS OF EACH OFFICER COMMUNITY.
    E.  ANY GSA REQUISITIONS WITH A REPORT MONTH INSIDE OF 
FIVE MONTHS WILL BE TREATED AS "MUST FILL," AND MAY BE 
FILLED BY NON-VOLUNTEERS FROM THE ENTIRE ROLLER POOL 
WITHIN THE FIVE TO NINE MONTH NEGOTIATION WINDOW IN 
ORDER TO MEET REQUIRED REPORT DATE. 
    F.  CONSISTENT WITH NORMAL DETAILING PRACTICES, NO 
"ALTERNATES" WILL BE IDENTIFIED FOR GSA REQUISITIONS.  IF A 
SELECTEE FALLS OUT GREATER THAN 120 DAYS BEFORE FIRST I-
STOP, DETAILERS WILL ATTEMPT TO REPLACE THE UNPLANNED LOSS.  
IF FALLOUT OCCURS AT 120 DAYS OR LESS BEFORE THE FIRST I-
STOP, COMNAVPERSCOM SHALL ATTEMPT TO FIND A REPLACEMENT 
FILL WITHIN 24 HOURS AND, IF NO RESOLUTION, SHALL PASS TO 
USFF FOR IAMM SOURCING.
    G.  SAILORS IN NORMAL DETAILING NEGOTIATION WINDOW (I.E., 
WITHIN NINE MONTHS OF PRD) ARE EXEMPT FROM SELECTION FOR 
IA VIA LEGACY IAMM.
    H.  ANY SAILOR WHO HAS COMPLETED A GSA TOUR IMMEDIATELY 
AFTER A FULL SEA TOUR SHALL BE EXEMPT FROM SELECTION FOR IA 
FOR THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THEIR SUBSEQUENT SHORE TOUR.
5.  GSA DETAILING EXAMPLES.  THE FOLLOWING SCENARIOS ARE 
EXAMPLES OF HOW GSA BUSINESS RULES MAY IMPACT SAILORS AND 
FLEET MANNING.
    A.  ENLISTED (ROLLING FROM SHORE TO SEA).  ENLISTED SAILOR 
APPLIES AND IS ACCEPTED FOR A GSA JOB.  THE SAILOR TRANSFERS 
TO ECRC FWD AND COMPLETES AN EIGHT TO 14 MONTH GSA 
ASSIGNMENT.
        (1) IF THE LENGTH OF THE ASSIGNMENT IS EIGHT MONTHS, 
THE SAILOR IS IN THE WINDOW TO IMMEDIATELY NEGOTIATE 
FOLLOW-ON ORDERS PRIOR TO DEPARTURE ON THE GSA.  AS SOON 
AS THE SAILOR IS GAINED TO ECRC FWD, FOLLOW-ON ORDERS ARE 
ISSUED TO THE NEXT SEA-DUTY ASSIGNMENT.
        (2) IF THE LENGTH OF THE ASSIGNMENT IS 14 MONTHS, THE 
SAILOR IS NOT IN THE NEGOTIATION WINDOW AND MUST WAIT TO 
NEGOTIATE FOLLOW-ON ORDERS UNTIL THEY ARE WITHIN NINE 
MONTHS OF PRD.
        (3) GSA ASSIGNMENTS ARE DESIGNATED TYPE TWO SEA DUTY 
AND COUNT TOWARDS SEA-SHORE ROTATION, SO THE FOLLOW-ON 
SEA-DUTY ASSIGNMENT WILL BE REDUCED BY THE LENGTH OF THE 
GSA.
        (4) THE GSA ASSIGNMENT RESULTS IN ONE LESS ROLLER TO 
SEA DUTY FOR THE EIGHT TO 14 MONTH PERIOD.
        (5) MCAF AND COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-40) SHALL WORK 
TOGETHER TO PRIORITIZE REQUIREMENTS SHOWN IN CMS/ID IN 
ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT TO FLEET READINESS.
    B.  ENLISTED (ROLLING FROM SEA TO SHORE).  ENLISTED SAILOR 
APPLIES AND IS ACCEPTED FOR A GSA JOB.  THE SAILOR TRANSFERS 
TO ECRC FWD AND COMPLETES AN EIGHT TO 14 MONTH GSA 
ASSIGNMENT.
        (1) IF THE LENGTH OF THE ASSIGNMENT IS EIGHT MONTHS, 
THE SAILOR IS IN THE WINDOW TO IMMEDIATELY NEGOTIATE 
FOLLOW-ON ORDERS PRIOR TO DEPARTURE ON THE GSA.  AS SOON 
AS THE SAILOR IS GAINED TO ECRC FWD, FOLLOW-ON ORDERS ARE 
ISSUED TO THE NEXT SHORE-DUTY ASSIGNMENT.
        (2) IF THE LENGTH OF THE ASSIGNMENT IS 14 MONTHS, THE 
SAILOR IS NOT IN THE NEGOTIATION WINDOW AND MUST WAIT TO 
NEGOTIATE FOLLOW-ON ORDERS UNTIL THEY ARE WITHIN NINE 
MONTHS OF PRD.
        (3) GSA ASSIGNMENTS ARE DESIGNATED TYPE TWO SEA DUTY, 
SO THE SAILOR WILL COMPLETE THE NORMAL SHORE ROTATION 
DURING THE SHORE-DUTY ASSIGNMENT.
        (4) MCAF, COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-40) AND OTHER 
STAKEHOLDERS SHALL WORK TOGETHER TO PRIORITIZE 
REQUIREMENTS SHOWN IN CMS/ID IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE 
IMPACT TO FLEET AND SHORE READINESS.
    C.  OFFICER (ROLLING FROM SEA OR SHORE).  OFFICER ROLLING 
FROM SEA OR SHORE DUTY APPLIES AND IS ACCEPTED FOR A GSA 
JOB.  THE OFFICER TRANSFERS TO ECRC FWD AND COMPLETES AN 
EIGHT TO 14 MONTH GSA ASSIGNMENT.
        (1) IF THE LENGTH OF THE ASSIGNMENT IS EIGHT MONTHS, 
THE OFFICER IS IN THE WINDOW TO NEGOTIATE FOLLOW-ON 
ORDERS PRIOR TO DEPARTURE ON THE GSA. 
AS SOON AS THE OFFICER IS GAINED TO ECRC FWD, FOLLOW-ON 
ORDERS ARE ISSUED TO THE NEXT DUTY ASSIGNMENT.
        (2) IF THE LENGTH OF THE ASSIGNMENT IS 14 MONTHS, THE 
OFFICER MAY HAVE TO WAIT TO NEGOTIATE FOLLOW-ON ORDERS 
UNTIL THEY HAVE EXECUTED THE GSA AND ARE IN THEATER, 
DEPENDING ON SPECIFIC OFFICER COMMUNITY DETAILING 
WINDOWS.
        (3) DETAILERS SHALL CONTACT THE OFFICER TO DISCUSS 
OPTIONS WITH REGARD TO CAREER PROGRESSION, PROFESSIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT, AND TOUR LENGTHS TO MAXIMIZE THE LENGTH OF 
ANY SHORE-DUTY EXTENSION WHILE KEEPING THE OFFICER?S 
CAREER ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE ALL COMMUNITY MILESTONES.
        (4) IF THE OFFICER IS ROLLING FROM SHORE DUTY, THE 
ASSIGNMENT MAY RESULT IN ONE LESS ROLLER TO SEA DUTY 
DURING THE ORIGINAL PERIOD WHEN THE OFFICER WOULD HAVE 
BEEN AVAILABLE TO ROLL (PRD IS ?DELAYED? BY THE LENGTH OF 
THE GSA).  HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURED NATURE OF 
OFFICER CAREER PATHS AND MILESTONES, A MORE LIKELY 
OUTCOME WOULD BE A NEGOTIATED SHORE-TOUR LENGTH THAT 
RETURNS INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS TO SEA ON TIME TO MEET CAREER 
MILESTONES, THUS MINIMIZING ANY READINESS IMPACT.
        (5) USFF, COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) AND OTHER 
STAKEHOLDERS SHALL WORK TOGETHER TO PRIORITIZE 
REQUIREMENTS, MINIMIZE THE IMPACT TO FLEET READINESS AND 
MANAGE CAREER MILESTONES.  OFFICER MANNING GAPS RESULTING 
FROM GSA ASSIGNMENTS ARE DISCUSSED IN PARA SIX.
6.  BILLET GAP MANAGEMENT.  THE GSA PROCESS CREATES 
APPROXIMATELY 3500 ?ADDITIONAL? GSA BILLETS, EXACERBATING 
EXISTING PERSONNEL INVENTORY SHORTFALLS AND INCREASING 
THE NUMBER OF UNFILLED OR ?GAPPED? BILLETS IN THE FLEET.  
USFF, AS TOTAL FORCE MANAGER RESPONSIBLE FOR FLEET 
READINESS, WILL WORK WITH COMNAVPERSCOM AND OTHER 
STAKEHOLDERS TO PRIORITIZE PERSONNEL ASSIGNMENTS TO 
ENSURE EQUITABLE ALLOCATION OF AVAILABLE PERSONNEL. 
    A.  ENLISTED GAP MANAGEMENT.  THE EXISTING NMP PROCESS 
INCORPORATES STAKEHOLDER EQUITIES AND PROVIDES AN 
ACCEPTED SOLUTION TO ENSURE FAIR ASSIGNMENT OF AVAILABLE 
PERSONNEL DURING EACH REQUISITION CYCLE. 
COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-40) AND USFF WILL CONTINUE TO WORK 
TOGETHER TO REFINE BUSINESS RULES TO OPTIMALLY BALANCE 
FLEET READINESS AND DISTRIBUTABLE INVENTORY.
    B.  OFFICER GAP MANAGEMENT.  USFF WILL WORK WITH 
COMNAVPERSCOM TO PRIORITIZE OFFICER ASSIGNMENTS TO 
ENSURE EQUITABLE ALLOCATION OF AVAILABLE PERSONNEL.  
COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) AND USFF WILL ENSURE AN ACTIVE AND 
ONGOING REVIEW OF REQUIREMENTS IS PERFORMED AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO REFINE PRIORITIES TO OPTIMALLY BALANCE 
READINESS AND DISTRIBUTABLE INVENTORY. 
ONGOING EFFORTS TO ALLOCATE THE LIMITED OFFICER INVENTORY 
TO REQUIREMENTS
INCLUDE:
        (1) NEAR-TERM REVIEW OF CURRENT OFFICER MANNING FILL 
RATES, AND REVISION OF PLANNED FILL RATES FOR VARIOUS 
AGGREGATED ACTIVITY CATEGORIES
(I.E., GWOT, OPERATIONAL UNITS, COCOMS, ETC.).   
        (2) IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIFIC BILLETS FOR WHICH FILL 
WILL BE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED, AS COORDINATED WITH USFF, 
COMNAVPERSCOM AND BUDGET- SUBMITTING OFFICES.
        (3) DEVELOPMENT OF A TAILORED OFFICER MANNING 
ALLOCATION MODEL WHICH PROVIDES TARGETED FILL RATES FOR 
AGGREGATE ACTIVITY CATEGORIES TO REFLECT SPECIFIC GOALS 
FOR URL, RL, AND STAFF CORPS COMPOSITION. 
7.  WHILE EVERY EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO EXECUTE GSA AND IAMM 
BUSINESS RULES AS PUBLISHED, THERE WILL BE CIRCUMSTANCES 
WHICH CANNOT BE ANTICIPATED.  NAVY IS COMMITTED TO FINDING 
THE BEST BALANCE BETWEEN THE IA MISSION, NEEDS/ DESIRES OF 
THE SAILOR, AND COMMAND READINESS.  UNANTICIPATED DEMANDS 
MAY REQUIRE TAILORED SOLUTIONS NOT COVERED IN THESE 
BUSINESS RULES.
8.  YOUR EFFORTS TO DATE HAVE BEEN CRUCIAL TO ENSURING 
NAVY PROVIDES THE RIGHT SAILOR WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS AT THE 
RIGHT TIME TO MEET OUR NATION?S GWOT SUPPORT 
REQUIREMENTS.  IMPLEMENTING THESE RULES IS THE NEXT STEP 
WE NEED TO TAKE TO IMPROVE PREDICTABILITY FOR OUR SAILORS 
AND THEIR FAMILIES AS WE PREPARE TO SUSTAIN THE CURRENT IA 
MISSION FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.
