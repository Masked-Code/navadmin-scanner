SUBJ/MOD_ACADEMIC YEAR 2024-2025 NAVAL WAR COLLEGE FLEET SEMINAR PROGRAM// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the U.S. Naval War College (NWC) Fleet 
Seminar Program (FSP) which offers intermediate level Joint Professional 
Military Education (JPME-I) through a set of three courses: Strategy and War 
(S and W), Theater Security Decision Making (TSDM) and Joint Maritime 
Operations (JMO).  Each course normally requires one academic year to 
complete, which runs from September through the following May.  All three 
courses are not offered simultaneously at all locations.  There is no tuition 
fee and course materials are provided on a loan basis at no cost to the 
students. Applicants must apply by 31 May 2024. 
 
2.  Background: 
    a.  The NWC FSP will be offered in 15 regional locations in the United 
States for academic year 2024-2025.  Planned locations and courses are:

    b.  Seminars meet once a week in the evening for 34 weeks. Completion of 
all three courses results in the award of a College of Naval Command and 
Staff diploma, as well as credit for JPME-I.  The FSP also provides a path to 
attain the NWC Masters Degree through the College of Distance Education 
(CDE)Graduate Degree Program (GDP). FSP students may apply for the GDP 
following successful completion of their first FSP course.  The FSP at all 
locations are conducted in-step with each other, so students who transfer to 
or assigned temporary additional duty at another location may attend class at 
the new location.
