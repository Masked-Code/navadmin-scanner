SUBJ/DISESTABLISHMENT OF SPECIAL WARFARE TECHNICIAN LIMITED DUTY OFFICER 
DESIGNATOR//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE DISESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL WARFARE 
TECHNICIAN (SEAL) LIMITED DUTY OFFICER (LDO) DESIGNATOR 615X.  THIS 
DISESTABLISHMENT WILL CREATE EFFICIENCIES WHILE INCREASING WARFIGHTING 
CAPABILITY THROUGH INTEGRATION OF EXISTING TALENTED OFFICERS INTO THE NAVAL 
SPECIAL WARFARE (NSW) ENTERPRISE.

2.  THE SEAL LDO COMMUNITY IS UNDER END STRENGTH AND HAS AN UNSUSTAINABLE 
BILLET BASE WITH LOW NUMBERS OF APPLICANTS AND SELECTEES. THE DISESTABLISHMENT 
OF THE SEAL LDO COMMUNITY WILL RESULT IN STRONGER CAREER ADVANCEMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES WHILE CONTINUING TO BRING THE NECESSARY SKILL SETS TO THE FIGHT.

3.  DISESTABLISHING THE NSW LDO COMMUNITY WILL TAKE PLACE IN TWO
PHASES:
    A.  PHASE I (EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY) PROVIDES TWO CAREER TRANSITION 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR NSW LDOS.
        (1) CONVERT TO SEAL UNRESTRICTED LINE OFFICER (1130).
CONVERSIONS WILL BE BASED ON DEFINED CRITERIA AND SOME TRADITIONAL 
REQUIREMENTS WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR WAIVER (I.E., BACCALAUREATE DEGREE).
        (2) REMAIN AS SEAL LDOS.  A SELECT NUMBER OF LDOS MAY BE ELIGIBLE TO 
CONTINUE TO SERVE IN THEIR CURRENT CAPACITIES UNTIL RETIREMENT.  
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRANSITION WILL BE MANAGED BY THE SEAL OFFICER COMMUNITY 
MANAGER (OCM).
    B.  PHASE II - BILLET CONVERSIONS.  BEGINNING IN FY13 AND ENDING  IN FY17, 
42 OF 48 SEAL LDO BILLETS WILL CONVERTED TO SEAL CWO  (DESIGNATOR 715X), AND 
SIX WILL BE CONVERTED TO SEAL UNRESTRICTED  LINE (DESIGNATOR 1130).  THE 
BILLET CONVERSION PHASING PLAN SUPPORTS A VIABLE CAREER PATH FOR SEAL LDOS 
CHOOSING NOT TO CONVERT TO 1130 THROUGH FY17.

4.  INDIVIDUAL CAREER COUNSELING IS AVAILABLE VIA THE SEAL OFFICER DETAILER 
AND SEAL OCM TO ENSURE THE BEST POSSIBLE INDIVIDUAL DECISION FOR CAREER 
SUCCESS WHILE INTEGRATING THEIR SKILL SETS INTO THE NSW COMMUNITY.  
INDIVIDUALS WILL COORDINATE PERSONNEL RECORD UPDATES WITH THE OCM.  FOR 
OFFICERS CHOOSING TO CONVERT TO 1130, THEIR NEXT FITREP WILL REFLECT THE 1130 
DESIGNATOR.  CLOSE OUT FITREPS ARE NOT REQUIRED.
