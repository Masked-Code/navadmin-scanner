SUBJ/2011 DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. HOLIDAY OBSERVANCE//

RMKS/1.  THE DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. NATIONAL DAY OF OBSERVANCE 
WILL BE HELD 17 JANUARY 2011.  

2.  DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. DAY WAS ESTABLISHED BY PRESIDENT RONALD
REAGAN IN 1983, AND THE FIRST OFFICIAL OBSERVANCE WAS HELD 15 JANUARY 
1986, THE ANNIVERSARY OF DR. KING'S BIRTHDAY.  IN 1992, PRESIDENT GEORGE
H. W. BUSH PROCLAIMED THE FEDERAL HOLIDAY WOULD BE OBSERVED ON THE THIRD 
MONDAY OF JANUARY.  ON THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL OBSERVANCE, 
THIS DAY IS A TIME FOR ALL AMERICANS TO HONOR THE LEGACY OF A POWERFUL 
CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER WHO BROUGHT CHANGE THROUGH NONVIOLENT PROTEST, AND 
IT 
IS A TIME TO REFLECT ON THE PRINCIPLES OF EQUALITY AND CIVIL RIGHTS THAT 
DR. KING CHAMPIONED.

3.  DR. KING CHALLENGED OUR NATION TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR INDIVIDUAL 
LIBERTY RELIES UPON OUR COMMON EQUALITY.  THROUGH THE RECURRING THEME OF 
THIS OBSERVANCE, "REMEMBER! CELEBRATE! ACT! A DAY ON, NOT A DAY OFF," WE 
ARE REMINDED OF THE STRENGTH OF DR. KING'S LEADERSHIP AND ARE EMPOWERED 
TO TRANSFORM HIS LIFE AND TEACHINGS INTO SERVICE.  IN 1994, CONGRESS 
DESIGNATED THE DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. FEDERAL HOLIDAY AS A NATIONAL 
DAY OF SERVICE, AND TODAY IS THE ONLY FEDERAL HOLIDAY OBSERVED AS SUCH.
