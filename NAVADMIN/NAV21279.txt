10.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a continuation selection 
board via the letter to the board (LTB) process.  NAVADMIN 220/19 announced 
the introduction of a new application known as Electronic Submission of 
Selection Board Documents (ESSBD), accessible through MyNavy Portal.  ESSBD 
improves the speed, transparency and confidence of receipt over current LTB 
submission methods, such as hard copy and e-mail submitted letters and 
related attachments. 
    a.  ESSBD is available for all promotion, advancement and selection 
boards. 
    b.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to 
electronically submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without 
attachments and will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) 
exactly what will be delivered and presented to the board. 
    c.  To utilize ESSBD, candidates must access document services 
through MNP at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record. 
On-screen instructions will direct the submitter thereafter. 
    d.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted.  If required, a full visual user 
guide is available through MyNavy Portal 
at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion. 
    e.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command not later than 2359 
(central time) (CT) 10 days prior to the convening date of the respective 
board, as noted below.  Submitters are cautioned to not wait until the 
deadline date to submit LTBs via ESSBD or other available avenues.

    f.  If unable to use ESSBD, the CSCSELBOARD(at)navy.mil mailbox account 
is capable of receiving encrypted correspondence in accordance with 
Department of Defense policy.  If sending a board package from a non-NMCI 
network (bumed.mil, eu.navy.mil, etc.), please review procedures listed in 
NAVADMIN 220/19. 
    g.  The written communication may call attention to the board, any matter 
concerning the record of the officer that the officer considers 
important.  Written communication may include, as enclosures, correspondence 
from any individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not 
originated by the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of 
the eligible officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must 
contain a written acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she 
desires such correspondence be presented to the board. Correspondence without 
such an acknowledgement is considered third party correspondence and will be 
rejected without being presented to the board.  Classified correspondence 
will not be accepted. 
 
11.  Questions regarding LTB submission and continuation should be directed 
to MyNavy Career Center by calling 1-833-330-MNCC (1-833- 330-6622/DSN: 882-
6622) or e-mailing ASKMNCC(at)navy.mil.
