POC/MR JEFF ROMAN/OPNAV N51/703-614-9782/JEFFREY.J.ROMAN.CIV(AT)US.NAVY.MIL// 
 
RMKS/1. THIS NAVADMIN EMPHASIZES THE NEED TO INSTITUTE A "WRITE FOR RELEASE" 
CULTURE ACROSS THE NAVY. MISAPPLICATION OF THE "NOT RELEASABLE TO FOREIGN 
NATIONALS" (NOFORN) DISSEMINATION CONTROL MARKING SIGNIFICANTLY HINDERS OUR 
ABILITY TO SHARE INFORMATION INTENDED TO STRENGTHEN INTEGRATED DETERRENCE 
WITH OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS. 
 
2. STRENGTHENING INTEGRATED DETERRENCE WITH ALLIES AND PARTNERS IS A KEY 
OBJECTIVE OF THE 2022 NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY (NDS)(REF A). AS STATED IN 
THE FACT SHEET FOR THE 2022 NDS (REF B), "MUTUALLY-BENEFICIAL ALLIANCES 
AND PARTNERSHIPS ARE AN ENDURING STRENGTH FOR THE UNITED STATES, AND ARE 
CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES." OVER-CLASSIFICATION AND/OR 
MISAPPLICATION OF NOFORN CONTRADICTS THIS GUIDANCE. 
 
3. THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES APPLY TO EFFECTIVELY SHARE INFORMATION WITH OUR 
ALLIES AND PARTNERS, ESPECIALLY THE "FIVE EYES" (FVEY): 
A. CREATE PRODUCTS AND WRITE INFORMATION WITH RELEASE TO ALLIES AND PARTNERS 
IN MIND. 
B. USE THE NOFORN MARKING ONLY WHEN SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED PER INSTRUCTIONS 
AND POLICY (REFS C-H). IF THE NOFORN MARKING IS JUSTIFIED, ATTEMPT TO 
SEGREGATE THE NOFORN MATERIAL (E.G., BUILD A NOFORN ANNEX) ENABLING EFFICIENT 
REVIEW OF THE CORE PRODUCT FOR RELEASE TO ALLIES AND PARTNERS. AN ANNEX MAY 
ALSO BE APPROPRIATE IN ORDER TO CREATE A DOCUMENT WITH RELEASABLE (REL) 
DISSEMINATION CONTROL. 
 
4. THE NOFORN CAVEAT MUST ONLY BE APPLIED WHEN INFORMATION CANNOT BE RELEASED 
IN ANY FORM TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS (INCLUDING COALITION PARTNERS), FOREIGN 
NATIONALS, FOREIGN ORGANIZATIONS, OR NON-U.S. CITIZENS WITHOUT ORIGINATOR 
APPROVAL. PER REF C, THE USE OF THE NOFORN CAVEAT SHOULD BE APPLIED ONLY TO: 
A. INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION (WHEN REQUIRED) IN ACCORDANCE WITH REFERENCES 
(D) AND (E) 
B. NAVAL NUCLEAR PROPULSION INFORMATION (REF F) 
C. DOD COVER AND COVER SUPPORT INFORMATION (REF G) 
 
5. PROPERLY MARKED DOCUMENTS ASSIST FOREIGN DISCLOSURE OFFICERS (FDO) IN 
MAKING RELEASE DETERMINATIONS. ERRONEOUSLY MARKED NOFORN DOCUMENTS OR 
DOCUMENTS WITHOUT THE DERIVED SOURCES INCLUDED MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY 
THE ORIGINATOR AND REQUIRE EXTENSIVE FDO RESOURCES TO REMOVE MARKINGS TO 
SHARE WITH ALLIES AND PARTNERS. 
A. ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION AUTHORITIES (OCA) ARE INDIVIDUALS AUTHORIZED IN 
WRITING, EITHER BY THE PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT, OR AN AGENCY HEAD (E.G., 
SECRETARY OF THE NAVY) TO CLASSIFY SENSITIVE INFORMATION IN THE FIRST 
INSTANCE. OCAs SHALL NOT USE THE NOFORN CAVEAT UNLESS THE INFORMATION MEETS 
THE CRITERIA LISTED ABOVE AND IN REF C. 
B. DERIVATIVE CLASSIFIERS INCORPORATE, RESTATE, OR GENERATE IN NEW FORM 
INFORMATION THAT IS ALREADY CLASSIFIED, AND MARK THE NEWLY DEVELOPED MATERIAL 
CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION MARKINGS THAT APPLY TO THE SOURCE 
INFORMATION. WHEN USING "MULTIPLE SOURCES" TO GENERATE NEWLY DEVELOPED 
INFORMATION, A LIST OF SOURCES MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE BODY OF THE DOCUMENT 
OR AS AN ATTACHMENT. 
 
6. DRAFT DOCUMENTS WITH RELEASABILITY CONTROL MARKING OF FVEY OR A SPECIFIC 
COUNTRY OR ORGANIZATION TRIGRAPH OR TETRAGRAPH. REF I IS DON FOREIGN 
DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE REGARDING FVEY THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ALONG WITH THE 
NDS AND NAVY GUIDANCE FOR BUILDING ALLIANCES AND PARTNERSHIPS (REF J), WHICH 
PROMOTE SHARING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION TO THE MUTUAL BENEFIT OF THE U.S. AND 
PARTNER NATIONS. 
 
7. TO ASSIST IN CREATING A "WRITE TO RELEASE" CULTURE, OPNAV N2N6 AND DON CIO 
ARE IMPLEMENTING A TECHNICAL SOLUTION IN MICROSOFT OUTLOOK TO REQUIRE USERS 
FULLY JUSTIFY THE NOFORN CAVEAT ON EMAILS. 
 
8. SUPPORTED BY A FDO, COMMANDS SHOULD REVIEW OR REWRITE NAVAL TACTICAL 
PUBLICATIONS AND OTHER PRODUCTS OR BRIEFS THAT INCLUDE NOFORN CAVEAT 
MARKINGS. FOCUS SHOULD BE ON THOSE DOCUMENTS WHOSE RELEASABILITY WOULD 
SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO INTEROPERABILITY AND/OR MISSION EFFECTIVENESS 
WITH OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS. IN SOME INSTANCES, FMS FUNDING MAY BE AVAILABLE 
TO SUPPORT SUCH EFFORTS UPON LEGAL AND FMS CASE MANAGER APPROVAL. IN ALL 
CASES, COMPLETING A REVIEW FOR RELEASABILITY OF CRITICAL DOCUMENTS PRIOR TO 
NEED PROVIDES THE NAVY THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY RESPOND AND INTEGRATE ALLIES 
AND PARTNERS WHEN REQUIRED. 
 
9. TO FACILITATE A "WRITE FOR RELEASE" CULTURE, COMMANDS SHALL DESIGNATE 
PROPERLY TRAINED FDOs THROUGH A DEDICATED BILLET OR AS A COLLATERAL DUTY 
DEPENDING ON SIZE OF THE COMMAND AND VOLUME OF INFORMATION. ADDITIONAL FDO 
BILLET ALLOCATION AT CRITICAL DOCUMENT DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS (E.G. 
SYSTEMS COMMANDS DOWN TO THE PROGRAM OFFICE LEVEL, WARFARE CENTERS, 
WARFIGHTING DEVELOPMENT CENTERS, FLEET/SQUADRONS) AND ALIGNMENT OF FDO 
COLLATERAL DUTY WITH LOWER ECHELON COMMANDS IS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL AND 
STRONGLY ENCOURAGED. FDO REVIEWS OF REQUESTS FOR RELEASE MAY PREVENT 
UNAUTHORIZED FOREIGN DISCLOSURES AND SECURITY VIOLATIONS. COMMANDS MAY ALSO 
DESIGNATE COLLATERAL DUTY FOREIGN DISCLOSURE REPRESENTATIVES (FDRs) TO ASSIST 
COMMANDS WRITING AND MARKING FOR RELEASE. FDRs MAY RECOMMEND RELEASE 
OF CLASSIFIED MILITARY INFORMATION. FDRS TRAINED IN FOREIGN DISCLOSURE 
PROCEDURES CAN PROVIDE RESEARCH AND RECOMMENDATIONS. OPNAV N5 AND THE NAVY 
INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS OFFICE (NIPO) (DON PRINCIPAL DISCLOSURE AUTHORITY AS 
PER REF K) WILL IDENTIFY AND COORDINATE WITH COMMANDS RECOMMENDED FOR 
ADDITIONAL FDO RESOURCES, HOWEVER, THERE IS NO CENTRAL FDO FUNDING OR BILLET 
SOURCE. PROSPECTIVE AND CURRENT FDOS/FDRs SHOULD CONTACT NIPO-01 TECHNOLOGY 
SECURITY AND FOREIGN DISCLOSURE (TSFD) DIVISION (NIPO_01_DDL@US.NAVY.MIL) TO 
OBTAIN DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO RELEASE CMI AND FOR TSFD AND FDO SPECIFIC 
TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. 
 
10. TO RESOLVE FOREIGN DISCLOSURE PROCESS ISSUES AND TO ACHIEVE THE NDS 
IMPERATIVE OF INTEGRATED DETERRENCE WITH OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS REQUIRES A 
LONG-TERM APPROACH TO BUILD A CULTURE OF RELEASABLILITY. BOOSTING THE 
CAPABILITIES OF OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS BY PROVIDING THEM WITH THE PROPER 
TECHNOLOGY AND NECESSARY INFORMATION IS VITAL TO OUR COMBINED SUCCESS TO 
DETER IN PEACE AND WIN IN WAR.
