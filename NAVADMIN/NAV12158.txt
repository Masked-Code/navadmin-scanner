SUBJ/MILITARY SPOUSE APPRECIATION DAY//

RMKS/1.  AS WE OBSERVE MILITARY SPOUSE APPRECIATION DAY ON 11 MAY THIS YEAR, 
WE HONOR THE MILITARY SPOUSES WHO HAVE SELFLESSLY SERVED ALONGSIDE THEIR 
ACTIVE-DUTY HUSBANDS AND WIVES.  THEY KEEP OUR FAMILIES "ON COURSE AND SPEED," 
AND THEIR SUPPORT ENABLES US TO FOCUS ON THE MISSION AT HAND - TO BE READY AND 
TO OPERATE FORWARD AROUND THE WORLD.  BY THEIR DEVOTION AND STRENGTH, WE 
REMAIN THE GREATEST NAVY THIS WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN.

2.  ON MILITARY SPOUSE APPRECIATION DAY, WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEMANDS ON OUR 
FAMILIES.  THERE IS AN INSCRIPTION ON ONE OF THE 26 BRONZE RELIEF SCULPTURES 
AT THE NAVY MEMORIAL IN WASHINGTON, DC THAT ACCURATELY STATES:  "THE NAVY 
FAMILY:  THEY WHO WAIT ALSO SERVE."  WE ALL KNOW THAT WHEN SAILORS GO TO SEA, 
THE CHALLENGES AT HOME CONTINUE, AND OUR MILITARY SPOUSES BEAR THE BURDEN EACH 
DAY IN SUPPORT OF THEIR LOVED ONES AND IN SERVICE TO THEIR NATION.  WE THANK 
OUR HUSBANDS AND WIVES FOR THEIR CONSTANT PATIENCE AND STEADFAST UNDERSTANDING 
AS THEY OFTEN FACE THE CHALLENGES AT HOME OR CELEBRATE LIFE EVENTS WITHOUT US.
THOUGH THEY MAY NOT WEAR THE UNIFORM - IT IS THEIR HONOR, COURAGE, AND 
COMMITMENT THAT SUSTAINS US.

3.  PLEASE TAKE THE TIME ON 11 MAY TO SHOW OUR SPOUSES HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE 
THEM.  THAT SPECIAL DAY SYMBOLIZES THE HONOR AND RESPECT WE HOLD THROUGHOUT 
THE YEAR FOR OUR SPOUSES AND THE MANY CONTRIBUTIONS THEY MAKE EACH DAY TO OUR 
NAVY AND OUR NATION.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.

4.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL JONATHAN W. GREENERT, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
