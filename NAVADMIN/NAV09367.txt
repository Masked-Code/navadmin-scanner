RMKS/1. AS DIRECTED BY REF A, THIS MESSAGE ANNOUNCES THE 2010 CALENDAR 
FOR AMERICA (CFA10), OUTLINING THE NAVY'S LARGE-SCALE CONUS OUTREACH 
EVENTS FOR THE COMING YEAR. EVENTS INCLUDE NAVY WEEKS, FLEET WEEKS, 
DIVERSITY EVENTS, BLUE ANGELS AIR SHOWS, SHIP COMMISSIONINGS, AND KEY 
RECRUITING EVOLUTIONS, AMONG MANY OTHERS.
2. EDUCATING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ABOUT THE CAPABILITY, IMPORTANCE AND 
VALUE OF TODAY'S NAVY IS AN ESSENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THOSE WHO SERVE. 
EFFECTIVE OUTREACH IS ALSO KEY TO CREATING POSITIVE AWARENESS AMONG 
INFLUENCERS OF YOUTH, WHICH NOT ONLY TRANSLATES TO GREATER 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE NAVY, BUT OFTEN TO INCREASED RECRUITING AND 
RETENTION ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY.
3. THE POLICY PROVIDED REF A, AND THE MANY TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
CONTAINED THEREIN, WILL ENHANCE PUBLIC AWARENESS, ESPECIALLY IN NON- 
FLEET CONCENTRATION AREAS, OF NAVY MISSIONS, PERSONNEL AND RECRUITING. 
CFA10 IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THIS EFFORT, PROVIDING A COORDINATED 
AND FOCUSED DEMONSTRATION OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH EVENTS ACROSS THE 
NATION. CFA10 WILL HELP AMERICANS GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
CONTRIBUTIONS OF THEIR NAVY, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE EXTRAORDINARY 
PROFESSIONALISM, EXCELLENCE, BRAVERY, AND DEDICATION EMBODIED BY THE 
MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY.
4. CFA10 OUTREACH EVENTS ARE SCHEDULED AS FOLLOWS (READ IN FOUR
