RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and directs compliance with
references (b) through (k).  Reference (j) places military protective orders
(MPO) in the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database.  References 
(b) through (i) remain current and in effect.  Per reference (j), all 
commanding officers (CO) will place all active MPOs in NCIC Protection Order 
File (POF) for the duration of the order, regardless of whether any 
individual involved in the MPO resides on a military installation.  MPOs will 
be submitted via the Consolidated Law Enforcement Operations Center (CLEOC) 
in accordance with paragraph 3 of this message, for inclusion into NCIC, as 
required.  MPOs issued by a CO remain in effect until the military commander 
terminates the order or issues a replacement order and will remain in NCIC 
for the duration of the order.  Per references (d), (e), (f), and (h), all 
issued and modified MPOs will be documented with Department of Defense Form 
2873 (DD Form 2873), February 2020, or subsequent version.  Cancelled MPOs 
will be removed from NCIC upon receipt of Department of Defense Form 2873-1 
(DD Form 2873-1), January 2020, or subsequent version.  Commands will retain 
MPO records within local files in accordance with reference (i).

2.  Authorities
    a.  Per references (f) through (h), COs have authority to issue an MPO 
when necessary to safeguard victims, quell disturbances, and maintain good 
order and discipline, which may provide victims time to pursue a protection 
order through a civilian court (should they choose to do so) or support an 
existing civilian protection order (CPO).
 b.  COs should consult with the first Staff Judge Advocate in their chain of
 command to determine how to best address CPO/MPO violations.

3.  Responsibilities
    a.  Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) must:
        (1) Provide installation commanders with a process to submit all 
issued, modified, and terminated MPOs to Navy Criminal Investigative Service
        (NCIS) via CLEOC.
        (2) In support of applicable Navy COs without access to CLEOC, 
provide a process to submit MPOs to the Installation Security      
Department.  Installation Security Departments will submit MPOs to NCIS via 
CLEOC.
    b.  COs:
        (1) COs with assigned Navy Security Forces Command Master-At-Arms,
        Independent Duty Master-At-Arms, or Security Officers (649x/749x)
        Performing law enforcement duties shall utilize CLEOC Protective 
Order Module to ensure all issued, modified, and terminated MPOs are 
submitted to NCIS.
        (2) COs of shore based tenant activities located on a Navy 
installation will immediately submit issued MPOs to the applicable host 
installation CO for entry into CLEOC.
        (3) COs of shore based activities not located on a Navy installation
        will immediately forward MPOs directly to their assigned NCIS Field
        Office or the nearest Navy installation CO for entry into CLEOC and 
ultimately into the NCIC POF.
        (4) COs of afloat units, in port, are required to immediately submit
        MPOs via CLEOC.  If an afloat unit is underway, deployed, or not
        otherwise able to access CLEOC, MPOs will be submitted as soon as 
network connectivity is resumed.  For emergent situations, MPOs shall be 
forwarded to the applicable Navy installation CO or NCIS Field Office for 
entry into CLEOC.
        (5) COs must provide notice to any Service member subject to a MPO or
        CPO that failure to comply with MPO or CPO terms may result in
        Administrative or other disciplinary action, to include potential 
criminal prosecution in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice 
(UCMJ).
        (6) COs must monitor CPOs and MPOs issued to personnel within their
        command per reference (k).  In the event of a transfer of a Service
        member with an existing CPO or MPO, COs must contact the gaining 
command within seven calendar days of the pending transfer and recommend the 
gaining command CO
        issue a new MPO upon arrival to the gaining unit.
        (7) COs must report any modifications or cancellation of the MPO via
        CLEOC Protective Order Module.
        (8) Per references (d) through (f) and (h), COs should consult a 
judge advocate prior to issuing or terminating a MPO.
    c.  Commander, Naval Legal Service Command (CNLSC):
        (1) CNLSC will ensure Region Legal Service Offices provide judge
        advocate support to commanders without their own servicing staff 
judge advocate throughout the MPO issuance and termination process.
        (2) CNLSC will ensure a module on the issuance of MPOs is included in
        the training curriculum for prospective commanding officers and
        executive officers, and for judge advocates and legal officers.
    d.  Service members must comply with MPOs and CPOs.  In addition to UCMJ
    Article 128b, MPO violations may also result in discipline for violation 
of UCMJ, Article 92.  Further, CPO violations may also subject offenders to
    discipline for violations of UCMJ, Article 134 pursuant to the 
Assimilative State Crimes Act, 18. U.S.C.  134.

4.  MPO Forms.  The current and fillable version of DD Form 2873 and 2873-1 
can be found at:  https://www.esd.whs.mil/directives/forms/.  On the 
effective date of this message, the current version of the MPO forms are DD 
Form 2873, February 2020, and DD Form 2873-1, January 2020.  Previous 
versions of MPO DD Forms will not be accepted.
