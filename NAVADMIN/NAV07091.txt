SUBJ/ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH// 
RMKS/1.  TO HONOR AND COMMEMORATE THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE OF ASIAN 
PACIFIC AMERICANS, MAY IS RECOGNIZED AS ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE 
MONTH; THIS YEAR_S THEME IS "PURSUING EXCELLENCE THROUGH LEADERSHIP, 
DIVERSITY AND UNITY."
2.  IN 1978, A JOINT CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTION ESTABLISHED ASIAN PACIFIC 
AMERICAN HERITAGE WEEK.  THE FIRST 10 DAYS OF MAY WERE CHOSEN TO 
COINCIDE WITH TWO IMPORTANT MILESTONES IN ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN 
HISTORY:  THE ARRIVAL OF THE FIRST JAPANESE IMMIGRANTS TO THE UNITED 
STATES (MAY 7, 1843) AND THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS CHINESE WORKERS 
MADE TO CONSTRUCTING THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD, (COMPLETED ON MAY 
10, 1869).  IN 1992, CONGRESS EXPANDED THIS OBSERVANCE TO A MONTH LONG 
CELEBRATION.
3.  WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHEN ASIAN PACIFIC 
AMERICANS BEGAN SERVING IN THE UNITED STATES MILITARY, THERE IS NO 
DOUBT THAT ASIA PACIFIC AMERICANS PLAYED SIGNIFICANT ROLES IN DEFENDING 
OUR NATION.  SEVEN FIRST-GENERATION JAPANESE AMERICANS AND ONE CHINESE 
AMERICAN WERE KILLED WHEN THE USS MAINE WAS SUNK IN HAVANA HARBOR IN 
1898.  IN 1903, NINE FILIPINOS WERE SERVING IN THE NAVY AND, BY 1905, 
THAT NUMBER HAD RISEN TO 178.  THROUGH SUBIC BAY NAVAL BASE, NAVY 
MAINTAINED A DECADES-LONG BOND WITH THE PHILIPPINES THAT RESULTED IN 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FILIPINOS JOINING THE NAVY.  IN 1985, COLONEL 
ELLISON ONIZUKA, A JAPANESE AMERICAN, LAUNCHED INTO SPACE ON THE FIRST 
SPACE SHUTTLE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) MISSION; HE WAS TRAGICALLY 
KILLED ONE YEAR LATER IN THE CHALLENGER EXPLOSION.
TODAY, OVER 30,000 ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICANS PROUDLY SERVE AS SAILORS OR 
CIVILIANS IN OUR NAVY.
4.  DOD OBSERVANCES OF ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH INCLUDE A 
DOD FORUM ON MAY 29TH, AS WELL AS A LUNCHEON AND MILITARY AWARDS 
CEREMONY ON MAY 31ST DURING THE NATIONAL LEADERSHIP TRAINING CONFERENCE 
OF THE FEDERAL ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN COUNCIL (FAPAC) IN ARLINGTON, VA.  
THE FAPAC CONFERENCE OFFERS OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL 
DEVELOPMENT THROUGH PLENARY SESSIONS, WORKSHOPS, EXHIBITS, AND SPECIAL 
EVENTS SUCH AS A JOB FAIR AND CONGRESSIONAL SEMINAR.  INFORMATION ABOUT
