RMKS/1.	This NAVADMIN provides an update on the NMCI Secret Internet
Protocol Routing Network (SIPRNET) and Non-Classified Internet Protocol 
Routing Network (NIPRNET) enterprise migration to WIN10 SHB.  It also 
outlines specific command leadership and user responsibilities required to 
ensure smooth transition, minimal disruption, and completion of the 
transition for all NMCI seats by
30 June 2018.  Per references (a) through (c), the navy remains on track to 
complete the migration to WIN10 SHB operating system on the NMCI network by 
30 June 2018.  This is necessary to improve cyber security, promote 
standardization across the Naval Enterprise Network (NEN), and comply with 
the DoD mandates.

2.  There are three ways that NMCI user seats receive the WIN10 SHB upgrades 
on SIPRNET and NIPRNET:  seat technical refresh (completely replaces the 
computer), manual wipe and re-image (W&R) process (same computer is taken 
from the user, reloaded and returned with the new operating system), and in 
place upgrade (IPU) (the operating system is upgraded via a software push 
over the network to the computer which remains with the user).  There are 
slight differences in how NIPRNET and SIPRNET upgrades are being handled.  
Procedures unique to SIPRNET are noted below.  During any of these processes 
there are required actions for command leadership and users  the WIN10 
migration is an all hands evolution.
a.  Command responsibilities:
(1)  Commanders, CIO's, and command
Contract Technical Representatives (CTR) will aggressively track the 
scheduled upgrades for their commands and ensure planned seat migrations 
remain on schedule.  Program Executive Officer for Enterprise (PEO EIS) will 
be alerted immediately of any schedule slips or technical difficulties 
preventing execution.
(2)  CIOs will participate in the weekly OPNAV N2N6 and PEO EIS WIN10 SHB 
update teleconferences; Thursdays at 1500 est.  Echelon II CIOs will be 
expected to brief any delays in execution, advise regarding actions planned 
to get back on track, and discuss any technical issues requiring resolution 
by the program office.
(3)  Communicate with users often to ensure specific migration schedule and 
process details are understood.
(4)  For the manual re-image process:  commands must make designated W&R 
computers available to NMCI contractor field services on the date and time 
provided to command CTR by the PEO EIS program office.  Local scheduling of 
the W&R process is both a CIO and CTR responsibility to manage.  They will 
work closely with local field service teams to execute on schedule and 
identify and report any additional support needed to PEO EIS.
(5)  For the IPU:  Early challenges with the initial WIN10 IPU solution have 
been resolved, resulting in the accelerated implementation of IPU to 3000 
NIPRNET seats per day on 24 April 2018. The IPU reporting portal (https 
://naeanrfkqr73.nadsusea.nads.navy.mil/reportmanager/pages
/folder.aspx?itempath=%2feua_reports) is in place for Echelon II CTRs.  It 
includes information on scheduling, computer status changes, and other 
detailed IPU reports.  Prior to IPU process initiation, a pre-load package is 
sent to the computer being upgraded and will need to be resident on the 
machine prior to the IPU final push.  Commands must ensure they know when 
users are scheduled for their IPU push and that all computers, including 
those normally used for telework and Wi-Fi, are connected to the NMCI network 
via network cable at their scheduled migration time, and for the five days 
prior.  CTRs and Intelligence Technology (IT) staff will remind users of 
reference (d), direction regarding end of day actions.  Users still on WIN 7 
will select "restart" vice shutdown, and select no when prompted for green 
shutdown.  This allows the computer to receive software patches and perform 
standard maintenance in preparation for WIN10 migration in the five days 
leading up to their IPU migration date.  The IPU process typically takes 16-
20 hours per seat and users should plan to be without their computer for 24 
hours in case issues are encountered that require help desk resolution.  Some 
users have experienced longer delays in certain geographic areas and network 
engineers and the contractor are working to resolve those latency issues.  
Computers that are not connected at their scheduled IPU time will immediately 
start the IPU process upon return to the network.  Seats temporarily deferred 
for the final IPU push due to technical difficulties will still receive the 
IPU pre-load packages to the computer and will see the start decryption now 
icon.  This icon is not a sign the computer is going to IPU, just that the 
computer has received all necessary pre-load packages.
(6)  The WIN10 SHB design requires optional software to create optical disks.  
Per DoD policy, removable media is required to be encrypted.  Roxio Secure 
Burn is the product selected for this capability and is available for 
ordering via your command CTR.  Support for unencrypted media is available, 
with an approved exception to policy, using the Roxio silver product.  If you 
require either of these capabilities contact your local CTR.
b.  Individual user responsibilities:
(1)  Know when your computer is scheduled for technical refresh, W&R or to 
receive the IPU.  Users and CTRs are notified a minimum of five days in 
advance of their computer migration date.  For any migration issues, 
communicate with your CTR for scheduling issues and the NMCI help desk for 
technical issues. the WIN10 coordination center at
(2)  Ensure your NIPRNET computer remains connected to the network and 
powered on for five days prior to your upgrade.  Ensure your power saver 
feature is disabled so the computer remains powered on.
(3)  Plan to be without your computer for 24 hours on your scheduled date.  
This will not affect your ability to log in to other computers and to access 
your data on the NMCI shared drives to continue work.
(4)  Back up any data that you have on your computer to a shared drive so you 
can retrieve it after your migration.
c.  Special SIPRNET computer considerations:
(1)  Seat migration:  The plan for SIPRNET seat migration will be promulgated 
to Echelon II CIOs and CTRs by
11 May 2018.  Users will be notified five days prior to their migration and 
SIPRNET IPU pre-loads will begin 1 May 2018.
(2)  SIPRNET seats where the hard drives are removed and stored when not in 
use (i.e., in non-open storage secret facilities) require specific 
coordination between users, CTR, and WIN10 coordination center to ensure that 
the migration can be executed within normal working hours.
(3)  SIPRNET migrations may also require additional coordination due to 
special Secure Networks connection types.  The program office will coordinate 
with command CTRs to account for method of migration and connection types at 
each command.
(4)  With BitLocker as the navys data-at-rest solution, SIPRNET computers 
with hard drives installed via removable sleds must remain with the computer 
they were encrypted with initially.  The hard drive will only successfully 
boot from the computer where it was encrypted. Once encrypted under WIN10, 
users cannot move hard drives between different computers.  Failure to follow 
this guidance will trigger the BitLocker user lockout.
d.  Quarantine (no network connection) procedures: Quarantine procedures are 
being developed for computers that miss their scheduled migration.  Details 
of those processes will be promulgated in early May 2018.  Any non-tactical 
computers that do not meet the
30 June 2018 deadline will be quarantined until they are migrated to WIN10.

3.  Users with specific operational concerns, capability questions and or 
application concerns should contact their command CTR and it staff, and 
review available information on the homeport site (https 
://www.homeport.navy.mil).  Command CIOs and CTRs requiring assistance or 
information are encouraged to contact the Windows 10 coordination center at 
win10coordinatio.fct(AT)navy.mil or (202) 685 -0471.  We appreciate the 
patience and flexibility of commands and users as we work through challenges 
associated with this migration.
This upgrade is critical to protecting our information and networks and will 
enable smoother future updates.  Your continued active engagement and support 
remain essential to meeting the 30 June 2018 deadline directed by DoD.

Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.
