Members who reach 15 years of active duty after 31 December 2017 are not 
eligible to elect CSB.

4.  Timing of CSB Payment.  Payments pursuant to a CSB agreement entered into 
on or before 31 December 2017 may continue to be made on or after 1 January 
2018, so long as the member reaches 15 years of active-duty service prior to 
1 January 2018.

5.  Election decision.  The decision to elect the CSB is irrevocable.  A CSB 
agreement made on, or prior to 31 December 2017, remains in effect.  More
