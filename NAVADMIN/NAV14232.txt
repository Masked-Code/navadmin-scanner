SUBJ/NAVY BIRTHDAY 2014//

1.  Happy 239th Birthday Navy!  On October 13TH, it is important that we 
reflect on who we are and where we started.  It is a day which marks the 
cornerstone of our proud service beginnings.

2.  As you operate forward, and stand the watch around the globe, you embody 
the characteristics of the patriots that went before us.  Our greatest 
traditions live within the foundation of their courage and perseverance.  On 
this day, we pause and remember the proud heritage and service of previous 
Shipmates.  Likewise, we will always remember those veterans who made the 
ultimate sacrifice for our Navy and our Nation.

3.  This year, our Birthday theme is *thanking those who support
us.*  Our families, friends, communities, industry, and organizations have 
helped support us and we owe a debt of gratitude.  Our success as individuals 
and as a Navy is achieved with them at our side.  We could not execute our 
mission at a high level without their unwavering support.

4.  Moving forward, we will continue to use the three tenets:
Warfighting First, Operate Forward, Be Ready.  We will be ready
today, while also building the Navy to win tomorrow.  From     13
October 1775 until today, history has proven time and again that a powerful 
Navy is vital to ensuring the prosperity of our economy and the safety of our 
citizens.  This is the legacy we celebrate today.  Happy Birthday, Shipmates!

5.  Released by the Chief of Naval Operations.//
