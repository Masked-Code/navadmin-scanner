SUBJ/ENLISTED FEMALE SURVEY TO SERVE IN THE SUBMARINE FORCE// 

REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/24APR08//
AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 5300.8C, COORDINATION AND CONTROL OF 
PERSONNEL SURVEYS.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the release of a survey to all enlisted 
female Sailors in the U.S. Navy.  As part of the Secretary of Defense repeal 
of the 1994 Direct Ground Combat Definition and Assignment rule, the Navy is 
developing plans to integrate women in positions and occupations previously 
closed to them.  As part of this effort, the Submarine Force seeks to 
understand the interest of female enlisted Sailors to serve in submarines.  
Female officers have been serving in submarines since November 2011.

2.  The survey is located on the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System 
(NSIPS) and takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.  All commands are 
requested to encourage their female Sailors to partake in this survey, 
regardless of desire to serve in submarines.  Each female Sailor's thoughtful 
and accurate responses will be used to shape future Navy policy and are key 
to getting integration efforts and plans right.  All responses will remain 
anonymous and do not commit the respondent to any further course of action in 
her career.  

3.  Following NSIPS log on, expand the 'Electronic Service Record' under the 
'Employee Self Service' link.  Expand the 'Tasks' link and click 'Survey 
Requests'.  The survey will be located under the 'Pending Surveys' window.  
For survey related questions contact Mr. Patrissi at (901) 874-2256 or via e-
mail at geoffrey.a.patrissi(at)navy.mil.  For specific NSIPS website 
assistance contact NSIPS help desk at (877) 589-5991 or via e-mail 
NSIPSHELPDESK(at)navy.mil. 

4.  The survey is the result of the coordination between the Enlisted Women 
in Submarine Task Force (EWSTF) and the Navy Personnel Research, Studies, and 
Technology (NPRST).  

5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until 31 December 2014.
