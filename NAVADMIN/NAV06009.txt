JR.  THIS YEAR'S OBSERVANCE WILL BE HELD 16 JANUARY 2006.  ALL HANDS

PRINCIPLES FOR WHICH DR. KING STOOD AND HOW THEY CONTRIBUTE TO NAVY
DIVERSITY AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCOMPLISH OUR ASSIGNED MISSIONS.

LEGACY OF A MAN WHO BROUGHT HOPE AND VISION TO AMERICA.  IT IS A
DAY OF INTERCULTURAL COOPERATION, WHERE WE COMMEMORATE THE TIMELESS
VALUES HE TAUGHT US, SUCH AS COURAGE, TRUTH, JUSTICE, COMPASSION,
DIGNITY, HUMILITY, AND SERVICE.  THE THEME FOR THE OBSERVANCE IS "IN
THE SPIRIT OF UNITY AND SERVICE.  REMEMBER!  CELEBRATE!  ACT!"  IT
IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US TO LEARN AND UNDERSTAND THE VALUES
FOR WHICH DR. KING LIVED AND DIED.
3.  MRS. CORETTA SCOTT KING, DR. KING'S WIFE, DESCRIBES THE MEANING
OF THE MARTIN LUTHER KING HOLIDAY:  "WE COMMEMORATE DR. KING'S
INSPIRING WORDS, BECAUSE HIS VOICE AND HIS VISION FILLED A GREAT
VOID IN OUR NATION, AND ANSWERED OUR COLLECTIVE LONGING TO BECOME A
COUNTRY THAT TRULY LIVED BY ITS NOBLEST PRINCIPLES.  YET, DR. KING
KNEW THAT IT WASN'T ENOUGH JUST TO TALK THE TALK, THAT HE HAD TO
WALK THE WALK FOR HIS WORDS TO BE CREDIBLE.  AND SO WE COMMEMORATE
ON THIS HOLIDAY THE MAN OF ACTION, WHO PUT HIS LIFE ON THE LINE FOR
FREEDOM AND JUSTICE EVERY DAY, THE MAN WHO BRAVED THREATS AND JAIL
AND BEATINGS AND WHO ULTIMATELY PAID THE HIGHEST PRICE TO MAKE
DEMOCRACY A REALITY FOR ALL AMERICANS."
4.  COMMANDS SHOULD COMMEMORATE THIS HOLIDAY CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT
MISSION COMMITMENTS AND AVAILABLE RESOURCES.
