organization and, whenever possible, to commemorate the U.S. Navy’s rich 
history and proud heritage.  Our past is replete with examples of toughness, 
initiative, accountability, and integrity on the part of American Sailors 
and Navy civilians who inspire and inform our modern force, especially in 
times like these.  As such, this year’s Navy Birthday theme is Resilient and 
Ready. 
 
3.  MISSION.  As much as possible and within the bounds of personnel safety,

preparations for the 246th NAVYBDAY celebration execution (13 October).
