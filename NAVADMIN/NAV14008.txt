SUBJ/2014 DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. HOLIDAY OBSERVANCE// 

RMKS/1.  The Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. National Day of Observance will be 
held on 20 January 2014.

2.  This year marks the 31st anniversary of the establishment of Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. Day.  The observance serves as a time for all Americans to 
honor the legacy of the civil rights leader who brought change through the 
principles of non-violence to make this country a better place to live.  The 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. federal holiday was established by President 
Ronald Reagan in 1983, and the first official observance was held 15 January 
1986, the anniversary of Dr. King's birthday.  In 1992, President George H. 
W. Bush proclaimed the federal holiday would be observed annually on the 
third Monday of January and in 1994, Congress designated the Martin Luther 
King, Jr. federal holiday as a National Day of Service. 

3.  The recurring theme of this observance, "Remember! Celebrate! Act! A Day 
On, Not a Day Off," empowers us to reflect on the teachings of Dr. King and 
to celebrate his leadership through service.  Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Day is the only federal holiday observed as a National Day of Service and is 
part of "United We Serve," the president's national call to service 
initiative that encourages Americans to work together to provide solutions to 
social problems.  As members of America's Navy, our global force for good 
embodies an ethos based on service and dedication to the welfare of others, 
which is part of Dr. King's vision of building a stronger, lasting community.  
Through dedicated service at home and around the world, Sailors honor Dr. 
King's legacy and reaffirm our common humanity through united efforts.  

4.  Dr. King believed in a nation of freedom and justice for all, and 
encouraged all citizens to live up to the purpose and potential of America.  
In honor of his legacy and commitment to equality for all, the Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. National memorial was dedicated on 16 October 2011.  It is 
the first monument dedicated to an African-American on the National Mall.  
The monument serves as a place of reflection on Dr. King's life, teachings, 
and vision of social justice.  Individuals can learn more about the Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial at the National Mall in Washington, 
D.C., at http://www.nps.gov/mlkm/.

5.  All commands are strongly encouraged to increase their knowledge and 
awareness of Dr. King's contributions to American history and civil rights 
through participation in military and community events.  More information on 
the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service, which transforms Dr. King's 
life and teachings into community action to solve social problems, can be
