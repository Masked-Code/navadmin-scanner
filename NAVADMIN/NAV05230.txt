GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THE DEVASTATION AND DESTRUCTION IN THE WAKE OF
HURRICANE KATRINA HAS GREATLY AFFECTED SERVICE MEMBERS NAVY-WIDE,
BUT NONE MORE SO THAN THOSE WITH FAMILY MEMBERS OR HOMES IN
THE AFFECTED AREA.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES POLICY GUIDANCE AND
PROCEDURES TO COMMANDERS/COS/OICS AND SAILORS, IN ADDITION TO THAT
ALREADY CONTAINED IN REFERENCES A THROUGH D, WITH REGARD TO
EMERGENCY LEAVE WHEN THE LEAVE DESTINATION IS WITHIN THE HURRICANE
KATRINA JOINT OPERATIONS AREA (JOA).  ITS RELEASE HAS BEEN
COORDINATED WITH COMMANDER, FLEET FORCES COMMAND AND COMMANDER, NAVY
INSTALLATIONS.  THIS NAVADMIN DOES NOT APPLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE A
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY LEAVE MAY BE RELATED TO HURRICANE KATRINA, BUT
THE LEAVE DESTINATION IS OTHER THAN IN THE KATRINA JOA.  REQUEST
COMMANDING OFFICERS AND OFFICERS IN CHARGE MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO
ACCOMMODATE MEMBERS BY GRANTING EMERGENCY LEAVE TO ATTEND TO THEIR
FAMILIES AND/OR HOMES AFFECTED BY KATRINA.  THE GUIDANCE OUTLINED
BELOW IS PROVIDED TO FACILITATE THE GRANTING OF EMERGENCY LEAVE
WHILE ENSURING THE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE CAN SUPPORT A MEMBER ON
EMERGENCY LEAVE.  THIS GUIDANCE IS DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE PERSONNEL
SAFETY.
2.  COMMANDER, NAVY REGION SOUTHEAST (COMNAVREGSE) MAY EXEMPT
COMMANDERS/CO'S/OIC'S AND PERSONNEL OF NAVY COMMANDS/UNITS/
ACTIVITIES HOMEPORTED/LOCATED IN THE KATRINA JOA FROM THE
REQUIREMENTS OF THIS NAVADMIN IF, IN THE BEST JUDGMENT OF
COMNAVREGSE, THE COMMAND/UNIT/ACTIVITY IS ABLE TO FULLY ACCOUNT FOR
THEIR PERSONNEL AND MAINTAIN MILITARY CONTROL OVER THEIR PERSONNEL
IN THE JOA.  COMNAVREGSE WILL NOT GRANT EXEMPTION IN THE CASE OF
COMMANDS/UNITS THAT ARE CURRENTLY DEPLOYED AWAY FROM THEIR HOMEPORT/
PERMANENT DUTY STATION (PDS)/INSTALLATION.  FOR PURPOSES OF
THIS NAVADMIN, THE KATRINA JOA IS DEFINED AS THOSE COUNTIES (OR
PARISHES) IN THE STATES OF LOUISIANA, MISSISSIPPI, AND ALABAMA THAT
HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED BY THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY
(FEMA) FOR INDIVIDUAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE (GO TO WWW.FEMA.GOV/
NEWS/DISASTERS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION REGARDING WHICH COUNTIES HAVE
BEEN DESIGNATED).
3.  THE FOLLOWING POLICES AND PROCEDURES ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY
AND SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL SUPERSEDED OR RESCINDED BY A FUTURE
NAVADMIN:
    A.  EMERGENCY LEAVE MAY ONLY BE GRANTED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

SPOUSE, MOTHER, FATHER, CHILDREN, SIBLING, PERSON STANDING IN LOCO
PARENTIS, OR SOLE SURVIVING RELATIVE); HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED THAT AN
IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER(S) IS DYING; HAVE AN IMMEDIATE FAMILY

CONTACT COMNAVREGSE TO OBTAIN THE LATEST UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION AND
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF THE "CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND" FOR THE
SERVICE MEMBER'S TRAVEL DESTINATION OR ANY INTERMEDIATE LOCATION THE
MEMBER WILL TRAVEL THROUGH.  THIS INFORMATION SHALL BE FULLY
CONSIDERED WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER THE EMERGENCY LEAVE REQUESTED
SHOULD BE GRANTED.  SWIFT AND SENSITIVE ACTION ON EMERGENCY LEAVE
REQUESTS IS ESSENTIAL.  NEVERTHELESS, CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO ENSURE
THAT AN EMERGENCY DOES EXIST WITHIN THE SERVICE MEMBER'S IMMEDIATE
FAMILY/HOUSEHOLD; THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE SERVICE MEMBER CAN
RESOLVE OR ALLEVIATE THE SITUATION; AND THAT THE PRESENCE OF MEMBER
WILL NOT BE AN ADDED BURDEN ON, OR THE MEMBER WILL NOT SUFFER AN

GRANT UP TO 30 DAYS EMERGENCY LEAVE, IN ADDITION, THEY ARE HEREBY
DELEGATED THE AUTHORITY TO GRANT OR EXTEND, EMERGENCY LEAVE UP TO AN
ADDITIONAL 30 DAYS (60 DAYS TOTAL) AS DEEMED NECESSARY.  COMMANDERS/
CO'S/OIC'S MUST ENSURE THAT THE AMOUNT OF LEAVE GRANTED OR USED BY
THE MEMBER WILL NOT RESULT IN A NEGATIVE LEAVE BALANCE FOR THE
MEMBER OR THE MEMBER BEING PLACED IN AN EXCESS LEAVE SITUATION
IN WHICH PAY AND ALLOWANCES WILL STOP.

MUST CONTACT COMNAVREGSE AT (866) 203-6004, PRIOR TO MEMBERS
COMMENCING TRAVEL INTO THE KATRINA JOA.  COMNAVREGSE WILL COORDINATE

CONTROLLED CHECK POINTS) WITH JOINT TASK FORCE KATRINA.
    F.  INDIVIDUAL SERVICE MEMBERS ON EMERGENCY LEAVE TO
DESTINATIONS WITHIN THE KATRINA JOA MUST, UPON ENTERING THE JOA,

ASSISTANCE.  MEMBERS SHALL CONSIDER THEMSELVES TO BE UNDER THE
ADVISORY CONTROL OF COMNAVREGSE FOR THE DURATION OF THEIR EMERGENCY
LEAVE PERIOD IN THE KATRINA JOA FOR TRACKING PURPOSES AND SHALL
CONSIDER COMVAVREGSE THEIR PRIMARY POC FOR ANY ASSISTANCE THEY MAY
NEED WHILE IN THE JOA.  MEMBERS SHALL FOLLOW ANY PROCEDURES
