RMKS/1.  THIS IS A CNO/DON CIO/FLTCYBERCOM/COMNAVCYBERFOR/PEO C4I COORDINATED 
MESSAGE PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND DIRECTION ON THE NAVY'S ROADMAP TO TRANSITION 
FROM LEGACY DMS ARCHITECTURE TO ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF CONVEYING OFFICIAL 
INFORMATION (OI).

2.  BACKGROUND.  PER REF A, DMS WAS PLACED IN SUSTAINMENT THROUGH FY -12.  
RECENT DOD CIO AND VCJCS GUIDANCE IDENTIFIED IN REFS B AND C DIRECTS THE 
SERVICES TO FIND ALTERNATE MEANS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO PROCESS ORGANIZATIONAL 
MESSAGES WHILE A POST-DMS ROADMAP IS DEFINED.  THE NAVY INTENDS TO CONSOLIDATE 
AND ELIMINATE DMS FOR ORGANIZATIONAL MESSAGING USING A PHASED APPROACH WHILE 
ENSURING CRITICAL MISSION REQUIREMENTS (IDENTIFIED IN REF D) ARE MAINTAINED.

3.  OPNAV ENDORSES COMMAND EMAIL EFFORTS CITED IN REF E.  THIS EFFORT HAS 
ALREADY RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF 84 BILLETS IN FY-11 AND $97 .1M IN COST 
SAVINGS ACROSS THE FYDP.  ACCORDINGLY, THE NAVY WILL NO LONGER SUPPORT ITS 
UNCLASSIFIED MESSAGING DOMAIN AFTER 30 APR 2011.  ALL UNCLASSIFIED NON-COMMAND 
AND CONTROL (C2) RELATED OI THAT HISTORICALLY WAS TRANSMITTED VIA MESSAGE 
TRAFFIC SHALL BE DISSIMENATED VIA COMMAND EMAIL OR OTHER TRANSPORT MECHANISMS 
SUCH AS PORTALS, WIKIS, BLOGS, ETC.  COMMAND AND CONTROL OI WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE SUPPORTED VIA SECRET NAVY REGIONAL ENTERPRISE MESSAGING SYSTEM, AS WELL AS 
LEGACY SYSTEMS SUCH AS FLEET SIPRNET MESSAGING.  IN COMPLIANCE WITH REF F, THE 
NAVY WILL CONTINUE TO EXCHANGE OI WITH OUR COALITION PARTNERS THROUGH ACP-145 
STANDARD GATEWAYS AND EXISTING CLASSIFIED MESSAGING SYSTEMS UNTIL A COMBINED 
COMMUNICATIONS-ELECTRONICS BOARD TRANSITIONAL CAPABILITY THAT FULLY SUPPORTS 
INTEROPERABILITY IS DEVELOPED.  NAVCYBERFOR IS TASKED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION 
OF COMMAND EMAIL AND ASSOCIATED GATEWAY SERVICES TO ENSURE INTEROPERABILITY 
WITH OTHER ALLIES, COALITION, JOINT, AND AGENCY PARTNERS.

4.  THE COMMAND EMAIL SYSTEM BEING IMPLEMENTED BY NAVCYBERFOR UTILIZES A 
COMMAND GLOBAL ADDRESS LIST (CGAL).  THIS CGAL INCORPORATES ORGANIZATIONAL 
EMAIL ADDRESSES THAT CORRELATE TO COMMAND PLAIN LANGUAGE ADDRESSES CURRENTLY 
USED IN LEGACY/DMS.  THE CGAL, WITH NAVY-APPROVED EMAIL SYSTEMS (NMCI, ONE-
NET, IT-21 AND LEGACY NETWORKS) WILL BE USED FOR TRANSPORT OF OI.  COMMAND 
EMAIL FINAL OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY (FOC) IS SCHEDULED FOR 01 APR 11.  ALL 
CURRENT INSTRUCTIONS AND PUBLICATIONS THAT DIRECT THE USE OF NAVAL MESSAGES 
FOR NON-C2 INFORMATION MUST BE CHANGED TO REFLECT COMMAND EMAIL OR OTHER 
ALTERNATIVE MECHANISM FOR DELIVERY.  REFERENCES AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ARE 
PUBLISHED ON THE NAVY OIX WEBSITE AT 
HTTPS://WWW.PORTAL.NAVY.MIL/OIX/DEFAULT.ASPX.

5. ROADMAP.
A.  THE NAVY HAS ALREADY BEGUN CONSOLIDATING AND ELIMINATING LEGACY /DMS 
ARCHITECTURE.  CRITICAL DMS COMPONENTS SUCH AS NOVA AND SUPPORTING SYSTEMS 
WILL BE SUSTAINED THROUGH FY-17 AND FY-18 TIMEFRAME TO SUPPORT CRITICAL 
NUCLEAR COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS REQUIREMENTS AND ALLIED 
COMMUNICATIONS.
B.  BEGINNING IN FY-12, THE NAVY WILL BEGIN TRANSITIONING ITS SHORE AND AFLOAT 
COMPONENTS TO AN IP-BASED INTERIM SOLUTION CALLED COMMAND AND CONTROL OFFICIAL 
INFORMATION EXCHANGE (C2OIX).  C2OIX IS THE NAVY'S TRANSITIONAL OFFICIAL 
INFORMATION EXCHANGE SYSTEM THAT CONSOLIDATES AND ELIMINATES SHORE AND AFLOAT 
SUPPORT SYSTEMS WHILE STILL FACILITATING MESSAGE TRANSFER VIA IP AS THE 
PRIMARY, PLUS FAILOVER TO ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS.  C2OIX IS DESIGNED TO 
SUPPORT A NUMBER OF MODERN MESSAGING PROTOCOLS SUCH AS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS 
INTERFACES AND EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE DATA EXCHANGES THAT CAN BE VIEWED AS 
PORTLETS, AND SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL.  MESSAGE COMMUNICATIONS WITH 
ALLIED, COALITION AND OTHER DOD SERVICES AND AGENCIES WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
SUPPORTED BY EXISTING CLASSIFIED MESSAGING SYSTEMS.  WITH IP CONNECTIVITY 
BEING PROBLEMATIC FOR AFLOAT COMPONENTS AT TIMES, COMMON USER DIGITAL EXCHANGE 
SYSTEM WILL REMAIN AS AN ALTERNATIVE PATH FOR MESSAGE TRAFFIC DELIVERY.
C.  FLEET BROADCAST IS IN SUSTAINMENT AND WILL NO LONGER BE FUNDED UPON C2OIX 
REACHING FOC DURING THE FY-17 AND FY-18 TIMEFRAME.  THE NAVY WILL CONTINUE TO 
EXPLORE OTHER COMMUNICATION MEANS TO FULLY REPLACE FLEET BROADCAST 
CAPABILITIES AND REDUNDANCIES.

6.  ACTION.
A.  ALL COMMANDERS ARE DIRECTED TO IMPLEMENT ALTERNATIVE METHODS DESCRIBED IN 
REF G FOR THE EXCHANGE OF NON-C2 RELATED UNCLASSIFIED OI.  ALL COMMANDS WILL 
REGISTER FOR AND ACTIVATE COMMAND EMAIL ACCOUNTS AND REQUEST ALTERNATE TOKENS 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDANCE POSTED AT 
HTTPS://WWW.PORTAL.NAVY.MIL/OIX/DEFAULT.ASPX.
B.  ALL COMMANDERS SHALL IDENTIFY ANY INSTRUCTIONS, PUBLICATIONS, NOTICES, AND 
DIRECTIVES THAT REQUIRE SENDING AND RECEIVING ORGANIZATIONAL MESSAGES, AND 
MAKE CHANGES AS REQUIRED TO REMOVE MESSAGING REQUIREMENTS, WHILE PROMULGATING 
GUIDANCE THAT FULLY IMPLEMENTS ALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR UNCLASSIFIED OFFICIAL 
INFORMATION EXCHANGE NLT 1 FEB 11.
C.  ORGANIZATIONS THAT CANNOT TRANSITION UNCLASSIFIED MESSAGING TO ALTERNATE 
METHODS BY 31 MAR 11 MUST REPORT TO THEIR ISIC WITH A PLAN OF ACTION AND 
MILESTONES (POA&M) NLT 1 FEB 11, SPECIFYING OPERATIONAL FUNCTIONS THAT CANNOT 
TRANSITION.  THE POA&M SHOULD ADDRESS RESOURCE AND/OR TECHNOLOGY SHORTFALLS 
THAT PRECLUDE THE TRANSITION.  ECHELON II COMMANDS WILL CONSOLIDATE ISIC 
REPORTS AND FORWARD TO NAVCYBERFOR.  NAVCYBERFOR WILL OFFER OPTIONS TO 
ORGANIZATIONS HAVING OPERATIONAL FUNCTIONS THAT CANNOT BE TRANSITIONED.
