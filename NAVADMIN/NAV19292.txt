RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a) and provides guidance for the 
Fiscal Year 2020 Cybersecurity Awareness Challenge (CAC) training 
requirement.  The current approved version of the training is CAC 2020.

2.  Per references (b) and (c), Navy personnel, civilians, and contractors 
with access to unclassified or classified networks must complete the 
Department of Defense (DoD) employee version of CAC by 30 September 2020.  
Note, CAC 2020 incorporates the Intelligence Community (IC) version of 
awareness training.  There is no longer a requirement to complete a separate 
IC version of the training.

3.  Personnel who completed CAC 2019 after 30 September 2019 but before CAC 
2020 was available shall receive credit for their annual FY20 training.

4.  Authorized methods for training delivery:
    a.  Commands can elect to complete CAC training using instructor-led 
delivery.  A command designated cyber security professional such as the 
Information Systems Security Manager (ISSM) or Cybersecurity Workforce 
Program Manager (CSWF-PM) must provide the instruction.
    b.  Total Workforce Management Service (TWMS), https://twms.navy.mil 
/selfservice/login.asp;
    c.  Navy e-Learning (NEL), https://learning.nel.navy.mil; (Note:  The My 
Navy Portal, https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/general-skills-training/gmt
(redirects users to the NEL link));
    d.  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) website, https://cyber.mil 
/training/cyber-awareness-challenge/;
    e.  Other approved training sources, DISA Digital Video Discs (DVDs).

5.  Ships can access the annual training from the NEL application hosted on 
the Navy Information/Application Product Suite (NIAPS) server, eliminating 
the need to reach back to shore hosted NEL websites.  The CAC 2020 course is 
available via the NEL Afloat Learning Management System Pub Amendment 112 for 
download by the NIAPS Administrator using the normal manual NIAPS distance 
support update process.  If unable to download Learning Management System Pub 
Amendment 112, ships can request a DVD with these files to be mailed by 
submitting a support request to Navy 311.  Additionally, CAC 2020 is 
available for pre-order from DISA.  To pre-order, download and submit a DoD 
Information Assurance Training and Awareness Product order form from 
https://cyber.mil/cyber-training/content-delivery-options/.

6.  Although CAC training is an individual responsibility, commanders and 
commanding officers are accountable for 100 percent completion of their 
personnel.  Training officers are responsible for ensuring their personnel 
complete and properly document the required training.

7.  Command training officers must validate training via TWMS or Fleet 
Training Management and Planning System (FLTMPS)
(https://ntmpsweb.ncdc.navy.mil/fltmps/) authoritative databases.
Training officers will manually record training completed via the DISA 
website, DISA DVDs, or instructor-led.  Manually record training in FLTMPS 
using the Learning Event Completion Form.  Report any discrepancies to the 
Navy Training Management Planning System Operational Support office at 
ntmps.support(AT)navy.mil or 1-866-438-2898/DSN 922-1867.

8.  The ISSM is responsible for reporting compliance to meet Federal 
Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 requirements.  Command ISSMs 
will disable accounts of users who do not complete training by 30 September 
2020 and provide non-compliance list to the Echelon II training officer for 
consolidation and final reporting to Naval Information Forces (NAVIFOR) N13 
at Navy Cyber Security Work Force (CSWF) Program Helpline.  POC for NAVIFOR 
N13 is Daniel Harrington, daniel.harrington(AT)navy.mil.

9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.

10.  Released by VADM Matthew J. Kohler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6//.
