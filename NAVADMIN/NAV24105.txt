    b.  E-6 evaluations due 15 November 2024 will be submitted as an addendum 
in the guidelines of this NAVADMIN.
    c.  Navy Sea, Air, and Land (SEAL) CWO (715X) applicants will be 
considered for selection in one of two Core Competency Areas
(CCA):  SEAL or SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV).  To apply, applicants must

more than one field may request a secondary CCA (e.g., 783X CI/HUMINT/783X 
OPINTEL).
    e.  E-6s serving in congressionally designated combat zones and approved 
contingency operations areas that meet the conditions of reference (b) are 
also eligible for LDO if all other eligibility requirements are met.
    f.  Due to ongoing rating mergers and realignments, eligible Sailors are 
encouraged to apply for the designator for which they have extensive 
documented technical expertise and leadership experience in their enlisted 
service records, regardless of the current rating.  Special attention should 
be given to the guidance in enclosure (2) of reference (a) and to the 
designator discrete requirements (available on the MyNavy HR LDO CWO 
Applicant Information web page).

commissioning process.  Applicants who are deemed ineligible after submitting 
must be declared ineligible by their current Commanding Officer (CO) or

boards is an important part of the board process.  Review of the application, 
review of discrete requirements for the applicant designator, having well 
thought out questions on technical expertise, leadership, and knowledge of 
the designator for which the candidate is applying, to include future career 
path if selected, are all great examples of board member preparation.

sheet must be marked for LDO and CWO candidates.

it is acceptable for the command to submit an applicant's package on his or 
her behalf, provided that the package has been endorsed by the CO and the 
applicant has been provided a copy of their entire package prior to 
submission.
Information received that is not under the cover letter of the applicant 
(e.g., third-party correspondence) and endorsed by the command, or not
