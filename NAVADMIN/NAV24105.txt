must have a security clearance prior to commissioning, be able to 
complete operational duty screening, and be worldwide assignable.

            (a) TIS waivers must be submitted to 
ldocwoocm.fct@navy.mil no later than 15 July 2024 for adjudication. 
Waiver applications received after 15 July 2024 will not be

    c.  Navy Sea, Air, and Land (SEAL) CWO (715X) applicants will be 
considered for selection in one of two Core Competency Areas (CCA): 
SEAL CORE or SEAL SDV.  To apply, applicants must request a primary 
CCA and those holding qualifying Navy Enlisted Classifications 
(NEC) in both fields may request a secondary CCA (i.e., 715X 
CORE/715X SDV). 
    d.  Intelligence CWO (783X) applicants will be considered for 
selection into one of three CCA:  CI/HUMINT, GEOINT/Targeting, or 
OPINTEL.  To apply, applicants must request a primary CCA, and those 
holding qualifying NEC in more than one field may request a 
secondary CCA (e.g., 783X CI/HUMINT/783X OPINTEL). 
    e.  E6s serving in congressionally designated combat zones and 
approved contingency operations areas that meet the conditions of 
reference (b) are also eligible for LDO if all other eligibility 
requirements are met. 
    f.  Due to ongoing rating mergers and realignments, eligible 
Sailors are encouraged to apply for the designator for which they 
have extensive documented technical expertise and leadership 
experience in their enlisted service records, regardless of the 
current rating.  However, special attention should be given to the 
guidance in enclosure (2) of reference (a) and to the designator 
discrete requirements (available on the MyNavy HR LDO CWO Applicant 
Information web page). 
    g.  Applicants must maintain eligibility throughout the 
selection and commissioning process.  Applicants who are deemed 
ineligible after applying must be declared ineligible by their 
current Commanding Officer (CO) or Officer in Charge (OIC).  A 
sample removal of recommendation format is located at

    a.  The names of the approved appraisal board members must be 
included in the CO/OIC endorsement.  Every effort (including 
teleconference media) should be made to ensure the senior board 
member is from the LDO or CWO designator's competitive category for 
which the applicant is applying. 
    b.  Interview appraisal board member preparation for applicant 
appraisal boards is an important part of the board process. 
Review of the application, review of discrete requirements for 
the applicant designator, having well thought out questions on 
technical expertise, leadership, and knowledge of the designator for 
which the candidate is applying, to include future career path if 
selected, are all great examples of board member preparation. 
    c.  The technical knowledge and potential blocks on the 
Interview Appraisal Sheets (NAVCRUIT 1131/5 (Rev. 04-2024) must be 
marked for LDO and CWO candidates.

members.  NAVCRUIT 1131/5 (Rev. 04-2024) is located at

CWO/. 
    e.  Fit with community qualifications block is not required to 
be filled out. 
 
5.  Application Submission.  Communication to the board (e.g., 
application, addendums, etc.) should originate from the applicant 
via their CO.  However, it is acceptable for the command to submit 
an applicant's package on his or her behalf, provided that the 
package has been endorsed by the CO and the applicant has been
