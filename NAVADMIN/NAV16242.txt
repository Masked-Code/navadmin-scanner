Rating and Navy Occupational Specialty (NOS) at the Master Chief Petty 
Officer (MCPO) level for active component and Full-Time Support only.  Force 
structure in the reserve component does not support this same change.

2.  The Naval Aviation Enterprise Total Force cross functional team, in 
collaboration with AW communities senior AW leadership (and their 
Commodores), Enlisted Community Managers (ECM) and other stakeholders have 
concluded that this change will open up advancement opportunities for Sailors 
in critical AW/NOS communities and will lead to increased numbers of 
platform-experienced senior enlisted on our flight lines.
