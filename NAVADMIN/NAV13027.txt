AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1500.80 - COALITION OF SAILORS AGAINST DESTRUCTIVE DECISIONS PEER 
MENTORING PROGRAM//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE MONTHLY TOPICS FOR THE PEER MENTORSHIP PROGRAM, 
COALITION OF SAILORS AGAINST DESTRUCTIVE DECISIONS (CSADD) FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2013.
CSADD WAS DESIGNED AS A RESOURCE AND TOOL FOR YOUNG SAILORS TO SUPPORT GOOD DECISION-
MAKING PROCESSES, ENABLING LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND INFLUENCE THROUGH PEER 
MENTORSHIP AND CAMARADERIE IN 18-25 YEAR OLDS.  THIS AGE GROUP ACCOUNTS FOR A LARGE 
PORTION OF DESTRUCTIVE DECISIONS AS THEY LEARN FROM LIFE EXPERIENCES.  IN OUR TRAVELS 
THROUGHOUT THE FLEET, FLTCM BENNING AND I REMAIN VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE GREAT WORK 
THAT CSADD CHAPTERS ARE DOING.  I ENCOURAGE NAVY LEADERS TO LEVERAGE THIS SPECIAL NAVY 
ASSET.

2.  FOSTERING A CULTURE OF MENTORSHIP AND LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT FROM THE DECKPLATES 
TO THE TOP ARE THE KEYS TO THE MOST SUCCESSFUL COMMANDS.  PEER TO PEER MENTORSHIP IS A

BEHAVIOR AND ALLOWING COMMANDS TO FOCUS ON MISSION ACCOMPLISHMENT BY LEANING 
FORWARD VICE REACTING TO EVENTS.
