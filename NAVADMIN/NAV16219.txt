RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces significant changes to the Navy’s Voluntary 
Education (VOLED)/Navy College Program.  It details the phased Navy College 
Office (NCO) transformation in CONUS from a traditional brick and mortar 
voluntary education service delivery model to a virtual service delivery 
model that will provide online access and support to Sailors at the time and 
place most convenient for them.  The OCONUS construct will not change.  
Existing NCOs will remain in place.

2.  Effective 1 October 2016, all Sailors, including those who previously 
visited other services education offices or counselors, must only use Navy 
VOLED services described in this NAVADMIN and other Navy instructions.

3.  Sixteen CONUS NCOs will transition to the new construct by 30 September 
2016 and close.  The NCOs at Naval Station Norfolk, VA, Naval Air Station 
Jacksonville, FL, Naval Base San Diego, CA, and Naval Base Kitsap, WA will 
remain open through the end of FY-17.

4.  Qualified education counselors at the Navy College Programs expanded 
Virtual Education Center (VEC) will continue providing information and 
education counseling services.  Sailors will have access to VEC counselors 
via phone, text messaging, and web-chat along with the ability to schedule 
education counseling appointments online.  VEC counselors are available to 
serve Sailors from Monday through Friday, 0600-2100 Eastern Standard Time.  
VOLED information may be found on the Navy College Program website at
https://www.navycollege.navy.mil, which is redesigned with enhanced content 
and services.

5.  College Level Exam Program and the DANTES Subject Standardized Test 
(DSST) exams will continue to be administered at National Test Centers 
currently operated on Navy installations.  Sailors desiring these or 
additional exams must follow the funding and reimbursement instructions 
provided on the Defense Activity for non-traditional education services 
website at http://www.dantes.doded.mil/examinations.

6.  Foreign language testing, i.e., Defense Language Proficiency Testing and 
Defense Language Aptitude Battery, though not a core element of VOLED, will 
continue to be offered at the CONUS NCOs remaining open through FY-17.  
Sailors may also request foreign language testing with other services as 
necessary.

7.  For all courses with a start date on or after 1 January 2017, all first-
