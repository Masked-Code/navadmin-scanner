RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN augments reference (a) and announces implementation of 
Command Advance to Position (CA2P) for Navy-wide execution for advancement to 
E-5 and E-6. 
 
2.  CA2P Availability.  Effective 1 June 2024, CA2P will be available for 
Active Component Sailors not participating in a Detailing Marketplace 
Assignment Policy (DMAP) rating as described in references (b) through 
(f).  CA2P will be available for all Sailors not under orders or with orders 
pending release, starting with all type 2, 3, 4 and pre-commissioned sea duty 
units, with plans to expand eligibility to additional commands in future 
Meritorious Advancement Program (MAP) seasons.  CA2P will eventually replace 
legacy MAP season execution for advancement to E-5 or E-6, with MAP quotas in 
future MAP seasons transitioning fully over to CA2P usage through the next 
two calendar years (following four MAP seasons). 
    a.  Command Requests.  Commanding Officers (CO) may recommend Sailors for 
CA2P at any time through one of two methods: 
        (1) For Sailors with more than 12 months until Projected Rotation 
Date (PRD), commands submit a Manning Realignment Request (MRR) in MyNavy 
Assignment. 
        (2) For Sailors within 12 months of their PRD, commands may submit 
CA2P requests via email to their respective Placement Management (PERS-4013) 
Placement Coordinator. 
    b.  Inter-unit CA2P.  The Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC) or Type 
Command (TYCOM) for the Sailor's current command can request a CA2P action 
for a member that qualifies within their subordinate units, using the method 
of paragraph 2a. 
 
3.  This NAVADMIN does not apply to submarine and surface nuclear trained 
Sailors.  Sailors in these communities will continue to be advanced and 
detailed via legacy processes. 
 
4.  CA2P Eligibility and Processing.  Upon receipt, PERS-4 will validate and 
execute the following steps for a CA2P request: 
    a.  Verify advancement eligibility.  The Sailor must have passed, (but 
not advanced) on the most recent Navy-wide Advancement Exam (NWAE) or have 
been selected for and still awaiting advancement. 
    b.  Validate that the requested billet is vacant or will be vacant within 
the next 18 months. 
    c.  Verify that the Sailor is willing to add additional obligated service 
to fulfill the tour length requirements for the higher paygrade 
billet.  Normal additional service requirements default to three years.  For 
overseas tours, service requirement must meet Department of Defense 
requirements or reference (b) as applicable. 
    d.  If the CA2P request is valid (i.e. the Sailor is eligible and the 
higher paygrade billet is valid for fill), PERS-4 will approve the alignment 
request, including the required amount of service extension the Sailor needs 
to affect the advancement. 
PERS-4 will generally refrain from approving CA2P requests submitted during 
the spring and fall NWAE cycle quota determination process, to avoid 
conflicts in the advancement processes while Navy transitions towards a 
billet-based advancement system.  Commands may still submit MRR requests 
during this timeframe (April and October) but can expect a delayed response 
timeframe. 
    e.  For inter-unit CA2P as requested by TYCOM or ISIC, requests will 
usually only be approved if the two units are within the same duty station 
and will not incur permanent change of station costs. 
    f.  Sailors must have two years of cumulative sea duty to be eligible for 
CA2P to E-5.  Sailors that have previously CA2P'd to E-5 must be willing to 
serve two years in addition to the current tour length to be eligible to CA2P 
to E-6. 
 
5.  Processing Advancements.  Once the MRR is approved, COs should submit to 
Transaction Support Center, on command letterhead, documentation certifying 
the completion of all requirements for advancement through CA2P, and PERS-4 
approval of the MRR.  The advancement is effective the date of MRR approval, 
and Sailors may wear the higher paygrade insignia immediately. 
 
6.  Incentives.  DMAP ratings remain eligible for CA2P in line with reference 
(c).  Sailors who are assigned to overseas tours will need to meet DoD 
requirements to be eligible for either the overseas tour extension incentives 
program or the consecutive overseas tour program.  Refer to reference (b) for 
additional details. 
 
7.  For additional questions on CA2P, contact the MyNavy HR DMAP team at 
DMAP.fct@navy.mil. 
 
8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
