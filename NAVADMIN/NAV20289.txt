3.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a promotion selection board 
via the Letter to the Board (LTB) process.  NAVADMIN
220/19 announced the introduction of a new application known as Electronic 
Submission of Selection Board Documents (ESSBD), accessible through MyNavy 
Portal (MNP).  ESSBD improves the speed, transparency and confidence of 
receipt over current LTB submission methods, such as hard copy and e-mail 
submitted letters and related attachments.
    a.  ESSBD will be available for all promotion, advancement and selection 
boards.
    b.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to electronically 
submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without attachments and 
will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) exactly what will 
be delivered and presented to the board.
    c.  To use ESSBD, candidates must access document services through MNP at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record.  On-screen instructions will direct 
the submitter thereafter.
    d.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted.  If required, a full visual user 
guide is available at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-
promotion.
    e.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command not later than 2359 
(central time) 10 days prior to the convening date of the respective board, 
as noted below.  Submitters are cautioned to not wait until the deadline date 
to submit LTBs via ESSBD or other available avenues.
Selection To      Convening Date    Due Date / Time
RADM              1 DEC 20          20 NOV 20 / 2359 central time
RDML              2 DEC 20          21 NOV 20 / 2359 central time
    f.  If sending a board package from a non-NMCI network (bumed.mil, 
eu.navy.mil, etc.), please review procedures listed in NAVADMIN 220/19.
    g.  The written communication may call attention to the board any matter 
concerning the record of the officer that the officer considers important.  
Written communication may include, as enclosures, correspondence from any 
individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not originated by 
the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of the eligible 
officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must contain a written 
acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she desires such 
correspondence be presented to the board.  Correspondence without such an 
acknowledgement is considered third- party correspondence and will be 
returned without being presented to the board.  Classified correspondence 
will not be accepted.
