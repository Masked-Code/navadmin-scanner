WASHINGTON DC/N1/152223ZAPR10//

AMPN/REF A IS NAVADMIN 134/10, APRIL-JUNE 2010 AWARD OPPORTUNITIES IN 
SUPPORT OF BUILDING A TOP 50 NAVY.//

RMKS/1.  TOP 50 ORGANIZATIONS BELIEVE PEOPLE DESERVE A GREAT PLACE TO 
WORK THAT IS PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY REWARDING.  THEY DELIVER ON 
THEIR MISSION WHILE FOSTERING A CULTURE OF TRUST, RESPECT, AND 
COOPERATION.  THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS (MANPOWER, PERSONNEL, 
TRAINING, AND EDUCATION) LEADS NAVY'S EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE INTERNAL AND 
EXTERNAL RECOGNITION AS A TOP 50 ORGANIZATION.

2.  SINCE THE START OF THE TOP 50 INITIATIVE, NAVY HAS BEEN NATIONALLY 
RECOGNIZED FOR EXCELLENCE IN WORKFORCE PLANNING, TRAINING, EDUCATION, 
DIVERSITY, AND LIFE-WORK INTEGRATION, EARNING
24 AWARDS.  RECENTLY, NAVY WAS RANKED #17 ON TRAINING MAGAZINE'S TOP
125 LIST.  MORE THAN 1,000 COMPANIES AND ORGANIZATIONS COMPETED FOR A 
PLACE ON THIS PRESTIGIOUS LISTING.  IN MARCH 2010, AT A CEREMONY ON 
CAPITOL HILL, THE NAVY PROUDLY ACCEPTED THE 2009 OPTIMAS AWARD FOR 
GENERAL EXCELLENCE FROM WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT MAGAZINE.  THIS IS 
CONSIDERED WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT'S HIGHEST ACHIEVEMENT AND IS THE  FIRST 
TIME IN 15 YEARS A GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED WITH 
THIS AWARD.  FOR DETAILS ON NAVY'S OTHER D ISTINCTIONS, I ENCOURAGE YOU 
TO GO TO WWW.NAVY.MIL/CNP/ AND CLICK ON THE TOP 50 BUTTON ON THE RIGHT-
HAND SIDE, OR GO TO WWW.NAVY.COM AND CLICK ON "ABOUT THE NAVY"
AND "A GREAT PLACE TO WORK."  TO FURTHER NAVY'S REPUTATION AS A TOP 50 
ORGANIZATION, REFER TO REF A TO PARTICIPATE IN FUTURE AWARD 
OPPORTUNITIES.

3.  NAVY'S TOP 50 INITIATIVE IS ALSO ABOUT IMPROVEMENT.  IN FEBRUARY, 
NAVY DEPLOYED A TOTAL FORCE SURVEY, THE FIRST OF ITS KIND, ADMINISTERED 
TO A RANDOM SAMPLE OF NAVY'S WORKFORCE OF ACTIVE, RESERVE, AND CIVILIAN 
EMPLOYEES.  SURVEY QUESTIONS EXAMINE AREAS OF JOB SATISFACTION, 
ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT, CAREER INTENTIONS, TONE, AND COMMUNICATION.  
WE WILL USE THESE RESULTS TO SHAPE OUR EFFORTS TO ATTRACT, RECRUIT, 
DEVELOP, ASSIGN, AND RETAIN OUR FORCE.

4.  WITHOUT QUESTION, THE NAVY IS A REWARDING PLACE FOR OUR NATION'S 
BEST AND BRIGHTEST TO SERVE.  WE ARE BUILDING UPON OUR SOLID FOUNDATION 
OF CORE VALUES AND COMPREHENSIVE PAY AND BENEFITS TO FURTHER ENHANCE 
OUR TOP 50 STANDING.

5.  POINT OF CONTACT IS CDR LISA TRUESDALE, N1Z, AT 703-693-0184/DSN
