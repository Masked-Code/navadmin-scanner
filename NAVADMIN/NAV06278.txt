SUBJ/CAREER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (CMS) ACCESS AND
PROTECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION//
1.   PROTECTING THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF OUR
SAILORS AND THE INTEGRITY OF OUR COMPUTER NETWORK
RESOURCES IS CRITICAL.  A KEY ELEMENT OF THIS
PROTECTION IS THE USE OF PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE
(PKI) AND THE COMMON ACCESS CARD (CAC) TO VERIFY
IDENTITY OF USERS AND CONTROL ACCESS TO OUR WEBSITES
AND APPLICATIONS.
2.  TO PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN
THE CAREER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (FORMERLY KNOWN AS JASS),
USERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM USING
THEIR COMMON ACCESS CARD THAT CONTAINS THEIR PKI
CERTIFICATES.  IMPLEMENTING CAC/PKI ENTRY INTO CMS
STRENGTHENS THE DEPTH OF PRIVACY ACT AND PERSONAL
INFORMATION PROTECTION IN THE CMS AND REDUCES THE
VULNERABILITY OF OUR NETWORKS.
3.  WHEN CMS RE-OPENS NEXT WEEK, USERS WILL NOT BE
ABLE TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM WITHOUT CAC CARDS AND PKI
CERTIFICATES.  WHILE THIS SECURITY REQUIREMENT
PREVENTS USERS FROM ACCESSING CMS FROM THEIR HOME OR
PUBLIC COMPUTERS (UNLESS THEY HAVE AN INSTALLED CAC
READER), IT PROTECTS THE VALUABLE PERSONAL INFORMATION
HELD IN CMS AND ALLOWS ONLY AUTHORIZED USERS TO ACCESS
THE SYSTEM.  DETAILERS ARE AWARE OF THIS NEW SECURITY
MEASURE AND WILL WORK WITH USERS VIA EMAIL, AS
APPROPRIATE, TO FORWARD REQUIRED INFORMATION.
4.  THE NAVY KNOWLEDGE ONLINE (NKO), INTEGRATED LEARNING
ENVIRONMENT (ILE), LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (LMS),
LEARNING CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (LCMS), AND BUPERS
ONLINE (BOL) WEBSITES ARE NOT CURRENTLY AFFECTED BY
THIS ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION OF CAC/PKI ACCESS.  IN
THE LONG TERM, SOLUTIONS WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT BALANCE
THE NEED FOR BROAD, BUT VERIFIABLE, ACCESS TO THESE
SYSTEMS AGAINST THE REQUIREMENT TO PROTECT THE PERSONAL
INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS THAT HOLD THIS DATA.
