RMKS/1.  IRT REF A, THE NAVAL AUDIT SERVICE IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS NAVY DTS 
ADMINISTRATORS WITH INSUFFICIENT SEPARATION OF DUTIES (SOD) WITHIN DTS.  
SPECIFICALLY, THE INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED HAD DTS PERMISSION LEVELS ENABLING 
THEM TO CREATE, REVIEW AND APPROVE TRAVEL AUTHORIZATIONS AND VOUCHERS.  
INSUFFICIENT SOD POTENTIALLY PERMITS THE CREATION AND SUBMISSION OF ERRONEOUS 
TRAVEL CLAIMS AND THE ALTERATION OF SYSTEM DATA WITHOUT VISIBLE EVIDENCE.

2.  DEFINITIONS OF DTS PERMISSION LEVELS MAY BE FOUND ON THE DEFENSE TRAVEL 
MANAGEMENT OFFICE (DTMO) WEBSITE: 
HTTP://WWW.DEFENSETRAVEL.DOD.MIL/DOCS/TRAINING/DTA_3.PDF INSUFFICIENT SOD 
EXISTS WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL USER HAS BEEN GRANTED PERMISSION LEVELS 2, 3, 4, 5, 
AND 6 OR ANY COMBINATION.

3.  ALL COMMANDS ARE DIRECTED TO IMMEDIATELY REVIEW ALL PERSONNEL ASSIGNED DTS 
PERMISSION LEVELS AND ELIMINATE CONFLICTS WITH INSUFFICIENT SOD.  WHEN 
REASSIGNING PERMISSION LEVELS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE, PERSONNEL SHOULD BE 
ASSIGNED TO ONLY ONE POSITION.  PERMISSION LEVELS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH 
POSITION MAY BE FOUND ON NAVSUP'S CONSOLIDATED CARD PROGRAM MANAGEMENT 
DIVISION'S (CCPMD) WEBSITE: HTTPS://WWW.NAVSUP.NAVY.MIL/CCPMD/DTS.
APPROVING OFFICIALS (LEAD DEFENSE TRAVEL ADMINISTRATOR (LDTA), ORGANIZATIONAL 
DTA (ODTA), FINANCIAL DTA, DEBT MANAGEMENT MONITOR (DMM), APPROVING OFFICIAL 
AND CERTIFYING OFFICIAL (CO) MUST COMPLETE THE CO LEGISLATION (COL) TRAINING 
AND DOCUMENT COMPLETION BY COMPLETING AND SUBMITTING A DD FORM 577 TO THEIR 
COMMANDING OFFICER.  ALL SIGNED DD FORM 577'S MUST BE MAINTAINED BY THE 
COMMAND.  SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR THIS TRAINING CAN BE FOUND AT: 
HTTP://WWW.DEFENSETRAVEL.DOD.MIL/SITE/GO.CFM?COL.

4.  IN ISOLATED CASES WHERE INSUFFICIENT SOD CANNOT BE ELIMINATED, COMMANDS 
SHALL PROVIDE THE NAVY DTS PM OFFICE, VIA THEIR ECHELON II LDTA, A 
JUSTIFICATION EXPLAINING WHY THE CONFLICT CANNOT BE ELIMINATED AND INCLUDE THE 
FOLLOWING MANDATORY INFORMATION:

(A) USER'S NAME
(B) PERMISSION LEVELS ASSIGNED
(C) JUSTIFICATION FOR PERMISSION LEVELS ASSIGNED
(D) MANAGEMENT CONTROLS ESTABLISHED TO MONITOR PERMISSION LEVEL ACTIVITY

5.  IF THE PERMISSION LEVELS AND SUBSEQUENT JUSTIFICATION FOR USERS WITH 
INSUFFICIENT SOD ARE NOT PROVIDED OR JUSTIFIED WITHIN 90 DAYS OF THIS 
NAVADMIN, ALL DTS PERMISSION LEVELS FOR THE ORGANIZATION WILL BE REMOVED.

6.  THE LDTA POSITION SHALL BE AT THE ECHELON II COMMAND.  THE LDTA IS THE 
PRIMARY POC TO THE NAVY DTS PROGRAM MANAGEMENT OFFICE (PMO) FOR FURTHER 
DISSEMINATION OF DTS POLICY.  SUBORDINATE COMMAND SENIOR ADMINISTRATORS SHALL 
BE ORGANIZATIONAL DTA'S (ODTA).

7.  THE NAVY DTS PMO HAS IDENTIFIED ALL FY10 TRANSACTIONS WHERE TRAVEL 
VOUCHERS WERE APPROVED FOR PAYMENT BY PERSONNEL WITH MULTIPLE PERMISSION 
LEVELS.  ALL ECHELON II COMMAND LDTA'S ARE REQUIRED TO REQUEST THIS DATA FROM 
THE DTS PMO, EMAIL: NAVSUP_NAVY_DTS_PMO@NAVY.MIL, FOR REVIEW AND DISSEMINATION 
TO SUBORDINATE COMMANDS WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THIS NAVADMIN.

8.  TO ENSURE TIMELY RESOLUTION OF OUTSTANDING TRAVELER DEBT, COMMANDS ARE 
INSTRUCTED TO HAVE THEIR FINANCIAL PERSONNEL WORK WITH THEIR COMMAND DMM TO 
COMPARE OUTSTANDING TRAVELER DEBT IN DTS WITH OUTSTANDING TRAVELER DEBT IN 
STARS-FL.  A SPECIFIC STARS-FL QUERY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO ASSIST WITH THIS 
EFFORT.  QUERY INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS ARE AVAILABLE ON NAVSUP'S CCPMD 
DTS WEBSITE.
