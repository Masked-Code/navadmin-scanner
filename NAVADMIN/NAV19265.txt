RMKS/1.  In accordance with references (a) through (h), this NAVADMIN 
supersedes NAVADMIN 024/19 and provides updated reporting guidance when 
Defense Industrial Base (DIB) networks that contain Navy Controlled 
Unclassified Information (CUI) have been attacked or compromised.  This 
NAVADMIN is effective immediately and shall remain in effect until the 
release of a revision to references (a), (b), or (c).

2.  Background.  Malicious Cyber Actors (MCA) have demonstrated the ability 
to gain access to contractor and vendor networks for the purpose of 
extracting U.S. Government data (e.g. CUI).  Immediate reporting to cognizant 
activities is imperative to inform leadership and operational community of 
the scope of the incident to understand the potential mission impact to the 
Navy.

3.  Reporting requirements:
    a.  Loss of personally identifiable information (PII) will be reported in 
accordance with reference (f).
    b.  Compromise of classified information will be reported in accordance 
with reference (g).
    c.  Cybersecurity incidents and attacks on Navy contractor and vendor 
networks that result in the unauthorized access and acquisition of CUI will 
be reported to senior Naval leadership via the Special Incident Report 
(OPREP-3 Navy Blue) message with reference (c).  Upon notification of a 
cybersecurity incident involving the possible loss of Navy data, the 
Department of Navy (DON) Damage Assessment Management Office (DAMO) shall 
submit the OPREP-3 Navy Blue message.  The report must be generated within 
three (3) business days of notification from the Defense Cyber Crime Center 
(DC3) or Law Enforcement.  DON DAMO should not delay due to lack of details 
from DC3 or Law Enforcement.  Voice reports also shall be made by DON DAMO to 
the CNO Battle Watch team ((703)692-9284) in accordance with the guidelines 
in reference (c), chapter 2, section 8, paragraph 2 upon release of the 
OPREP-3 report.  A follow up report will be issued after the initial 
assessment is completed by Law Enforcement and/or DC3.  A close-out report 
will be issued after Law Enforcement and/or DON DAMO completes its final 
assessment.  In the event of a new discovery or information is obtained after 
an OPREP-3 has been closed, an OPREP-3 report will be reissued with updated 
information.

4.  OPREP-3 Navy Blue Report Content.  Timely and accurate reporting of 
cybersecurity incidents is critical to the process.  In general, voice and 
record message reports shall address the following (if known):
    a.  What Happened (General background of incident, company names will be 
redacted in reports)
    b.  Actions Taken (Describe what has been done to-date)
    c.  Actions Planned
    d.  Incident Collection Number (DAMO MIR Number or Law Enforcement 
incident ID)
    e.  Comments
    f.  Contact Information

6.  Related reporting requirements.  All incidents involving loss or

from a DIB contract partner are required to be reported by the contractor to 
the DoD via DIBNet (https://dibnet.dod.mil/).  Reporting to the DIBNet is a 
contractual obligation of the contractor, per reference (e).  The OPREP-3 
report is required in addition to the contractor report to notify key 
stakeholders within the Navy.

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until canceled or superseded.
