SUBJ/REVISIONS TO THE CAREER INTERMISSION PILOT PROGRAM//

REF/A/DOC/SEC 522 
NDAA/03JAN13/NOTAL// REF/B/DOC/OPNAV/14FEB13// NARR/ REF A IS SECTION 522 OF H.R. 4310, 
NDAA OF FY-13.  REF B IS OPNAVINST 1330.2B, NAVY CAREER INTERMISSION PILOT PROGRAM 
GUIDELINES.// 

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces recent legislative revisions announced in ref (a) to the Navy's 
Career Intermission Pilot Program (CIPP) guidelines contained in ref (b).  CIPP was developed and 
authorized to determine if retention in critical skill sets could be enhanced by permitting temporary 
inactivation from active duty and providing greater flexibility in career paths of service members.  

2.  Ref (a) program changes include:  
    a.  Participants are now authorized to carry forward an unused accrued leave balance, not to exceed 
60 days.  
    b.  Full Time Support personnel (FTS) may now participate in CIPP.  
    c.  Allow certain critically injured or ill participants to be treated under same provisions as a member 
serving on active duty.

3.  CIPP provides a one time temporary transition from active duty to the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) 
for a period of one to three years for service members to pursue personal or professional obligations 
outside the Navy, while providing a means for their seamless return to active duty.  The long term intent 
of this program is to retain the valuable experience and training of our service members that would 
otherwise be lost due to separation.  Examples of participants include, but are not limited to service 
members:  desiring to start a family, taking care of critical elder care obligations, volunteering for 
international aid work, or pursuing higher education.

4.  During the period of inactive duty in the IRR, the member is provided full active duty Tricare health 
benefits for themselves and their dependents, a monthly stipend of two times 1/30th of their basic pay, 
and a one-time move to a conus location of their choice for the duration of their participation in the 
pilot program.  All program participants will return to active duty at the end of the period prescribed and 
will incur a two month for every one month of program participation Obligated Service (OBLISERVE) in 
addition to any existing OBLISERVE owed to the Navy.  For example, a member who elects a one-year 
period of inactive duty will incur a two-year OBLISERVE.  Maximum CIPP participation is three years for a 
corresponding six-year OBLISERVE.

5.  Program participants' time in the IRR will not count towards eligibility for retirement, computation of 
retired or retainer pay, computation of total years of commissioned service, or high year tenure 
limitations.  As such, the member will be exempt from promotion considerations during program 
participation and will return to active duty in the same grade and time-in-grade last held on active duty. 
Officers will have their date of rank adjusted to a later date and enlisted members will be eligible by 
reason of time-in-grade for promotion, to include active duty service date recalculation.

6.  Interested personnel should carefully review ref (b) for a full overview of CIPP guidelines, eligibility 
requirements, and application criteria.  Applications are currently being accepted on a first come first 
served basis and must be submitted in proper letter format to the office of the Chief of Naval 
Operations, Director, Office of Diversity and inclusion (OPNAV N134) via the applicant's commanding 
officer.

7.  CIPP presents a unique opportunity to test an alternative retention tool and support a service 
member's desire to take a career "off ramp" without penalty and return to active duty to complete a 
successful navy career.  Eligible service members are highly encouraged to consider applying for CIPP.  
Questions regarding CIPP guidelines and eligibility criteria may be directed to the program manager 
listed below.

8.  Relevant instructions and documents can be located under the career intermission tab on the 
life/work integration webpage at www.public.navy.mil/ bupers-npc/support/tflw/pages/default.aspx.

9.  Point of contact is LCDR Christopher Muller at (703) 604-5479/DSN 664, or via email at 
christopher.muller(at)navy.mil.

10.  File a copy of this message with ref (b).  These changes will be promulgated during the next revision 
to ref (b).
