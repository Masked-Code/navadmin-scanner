ANNOUNCEMENT.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES REVISED APPLICATION 
PROCEDURES FOR THE NAVY'S CAREER INTERMISSION PILOT 
PROGRAM (CIPP).  ALL POLICY CHANGES WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO 
THE NEXT REVISION OF REF B.  REF A AUTHORIZED THE MILITARY 
SERVICES TO IMPLEMENT CIPP TO DETERMINE IF RETENTION IN CRITICAL 
SKILL SETS CAN BE ENHANCED BY PERMITTING  TEMPORARY INACTIVATION 
FROM ACTIVE DUTY AND PROVIDING GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN CAREER 
PATHS OF SERVICE MEMBERS.  NINE OFFICERS AND SIX ENLISTED 
SERVICE MEMBERS WERE BOARD SELECTED IN MAY FOR CIPP 
PARTICIPATION.  SEVERAL 2009 QUOTAS ARE STILL AVAILABLE.

2.  TO RESPOND TO THE NEED FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY, APPLICATIONS 
FOR CIPP WILL NOW BE ACCEPTED AND APPROVED BY A 
"ROLLING APPLICATION" PROCESS.  QUOTAS FOR EACH CALENDAR YEAR 
2009, 2010, 2011, AND 2012 ARE AVAILABLE, NOT TO EXCEED THE 
MAXIMUM LIMIT OF 20 OFFICERS AND 20 ENLISTED MEMBERS IN EACH 
CALENDAR YEAR.  INTERESTED SERVICE MEMBERS ARE HIGHLY ENCOURAGED 
TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION, PER REF B, TO THEIR DETAILER FOR REVIEW.  
THOSE PACKAGES THAT MEET ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS WILL BE 
FORWARDED VIA THEIR COMMUNITY MANAGER (BUPERS-3) FOR FINAL 
SELECTION BY COMMANDER, NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (NAVPERSCOM).   

3.  CIPP PRESENTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST AN ALTERNATIVE 
RETENTION TOOL AND SUPPORT SERVICE MEMBER'S DESIRE TO TAKE A 
CAREER INTERMISSION WITHOUT PENALTY AND RETURN TO ACTIVE DUTY TO 
COMPLETE A SUCCESSFUL NAVY CAREER.  INTERESTED SERVICE MEMBERS 
ARE HIGHLY ENCOURAGED TO REVIEW REF B AND SUBMIT AN APPLICATION 
FOR CONSIDERATION.

4.  QUESTIONS REGARDING PROGRAM GUIDELINES AND ELIGIBILITY 
CRITERIA MAY BE DIRECTED TO THE PROGRAM MANAGERS LISTED BELOW.  
TO VIEW UPDATED APPLICATION GUIDELINES, REFER TO THE CAREER 
INTERMISSION TAB ON THE TASK FORCE LIFE/WORK WEBPAGE.  RELEVANT 
INSTRUCTIONS AND DOCUMENTS CAN BE LOCATED UNDER THE CAREER 
INTERMISSION TAB ON THE TASK FORCE LIFE/WORK WEBPAGE AT
