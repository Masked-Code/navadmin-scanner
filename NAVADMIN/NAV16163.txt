RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Junior Permanent Military Professor 
(JPMP) Board for November 2016.  The JPMP Program seeks active duty, 
unrestricted line or Information Warfare community, post-department head 
officers in year groups 03-09, preferably with teaching experience, to join

approximately 12 months of graduate education.  This will be directly 
followed by a teaching assignment to USNA as JPMP until statutory retirement 
or selection to O-5.

4.  Officer community managers (OCMs) will identify year groups eligible 
within designators from which a limited number of applicants may be selected.  
OCMs will also review all applicant records to ensure compliance with 
eligibility requirements.

LCDR-grade nuclear billet aboard a nuclear-powered ship or be senior to those 
currently assigned as department heads.
    c.  All nuclear-trained applicants should seek approval from their OCM 
prior to submitting an application.
