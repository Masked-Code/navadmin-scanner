SUBJ/ENLISTED EARLY TRANSITION PROGRAM//

RMKS/1.  OUR SUCCESSFUL STAY NAVY MESSAGE HAS YIELDED EXCELLENT 
REENLISTMENT RATES AND LOW ATTRITION.  WE HAVE ALSO HAD STELLAR 
RECRUITING SUCCESSES, INCREASING THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF SAILORS 
PROVIDED TO THE FLEET.  THESE CONDITIONS PUT US IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO 
EXPAND EARLY SEPARATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELECTED SAILORS AND SAILORS 
WHO HAVE RECEIVED A PERFORM TO SERVE SEPARATION LETTER WHO WOULD 
OTHERWISE SEPARATE LATER IN THE FISCAL YEAR.  VOLUNTARY EARLY 
SEPARATION OF SELECTED SAILORS WILL ALLOW THE STABILIZATION AND 
ALIGNING OF THE FORCE AS NECESSARY.

2.  EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, QUALIFIED ENLISTED SAILORS MAY SUBMIT 
REQUESTS FOR EARLY SEPARATION TO COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-832) VIA THEIR CO

SERVICE (EAOS) OR EXTENDED EAOS.  REQUESTED SEPARATION DATE UNDER THIS 
PROGRAM MUST BE NO LATER THAN 15 SEPTEMBER 2010, AND MAY BE NO GREATER 
THAN 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO EAOS.  FOR EXAMPLE, A QUALIFIED SERVICEMEMBER 
WITH AN EAOS OF 12 AUGUST 2010 MAY REQUEST SEPARATION WITH AN EFFECTIVE 
DATE AS EARLY AS 12 AUGUST 2009.

NOT FORWARD ANY REQUESTS TO COMNAVPERSCOM THAT THEY DEEM UNSUPPORTABLE.

POSITIVE CO ENDORSEMENT.  APPROVAL RECOMMENDATIONS, ESPECIALLY FOR 
SAILORS WHO POSSESS A CRITICAL NEC AS LISTED IN THE MOST RECENT CAREER 
REENLISTMENT OBJECTIVES NAVADMIN, WILL BE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY 
REQUIREMENTS.

AVAILABILITY.
