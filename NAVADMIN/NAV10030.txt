SUBJ/HAITI RELIEF OPERATIONS// 

RMKS/1.  THE SCALE OF THE TRAGEDY THAT STRUCK HAITI IS UNIMAGINABLE.
IT MOBILIZED A GLOBAL RESPONSE TO RELIEVE THE SUFFERING IN THAT ISLAND 
NATION.  OUR NAVY LEANED FORWARD FROM THE OUTSET, DELIVERING ASSISTANCE 
IN MANY FORMS.  EVEN AS WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST AND CONDUCTING OTHER, WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS, WE RESPONDED IN FORCE.  
WE LEVERAGED OUR TRADEMARK FLEXIBILITY AND RESPONSIVENESS TO QUICKLY 
DELIVER AS A GLOBAL FORCE FOR GOOD.
2.  TODAY, OUR SHIPS, AIRCRAFT, AND THOUSANDS OF SAILORS AND MARINES 
ARE ON SCENE DELIVERING RELIEF, SAVING LIVES, AND SURVEYING AND 
REPAIRING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.  THE SPEED AND SCALE OF THE NAVY'S 
RESPONSE WERE GROUNDED IN OUR READINESS, PROFESSIONALISM, AND 
COMPETENCE. YOUR ACTIONS HAVE MADE THE ENTIRE NATION PROUD.  WELL DONE 
AND MANY THANKS TO ALL INVOLVED.
