REF/B/TITLE 10 U.S.C./19JAN04//

NARR/REF A IS MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1212-020, REDESIGNATION PROCEDURES FOR 
LIMITED DUTY OFFICERS (LDOs) AND CHIEF WARRANT OFFICERS (CWOs) WITHIN THEIR 
RESPECTIVE COMMUNITY.  REF B IS TITLE 10 U.S.C, SECTION 580, REGULAR WARRANT 
OFFICER TWICE FAILING OF SELECTION FOR
PROMOTION:  INVOLUNTARY RETIREMENT OR SEPARATION.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the suspension of 753X accessions and merger 
of the civil engineer corps (CEC) chief warrant officer
(CWO) designator 753X into the CEC limited duty officer (LDO) designator 
653X.  This message only applies to active-duty CEC CWOs; the current policy 
that merges reserve CEC CWOs into the reserve LDO community remains in 
effect.

2.  Due to reductions to Naval Construction Force end strength, there are no 
longer enough billets to sustain the CEC CWO community.
Merging the CWO billets into the CEC LDO designator and suspending CWO 
accessions will ensure the future sustainability of the CEC prior-enlisted 
community.

3.  Current CEC CWO5s, CWO4s, and those CWO3s who have failed to select twice 
to CWO4 (designator 753X) will not be eligible for redesignation to LDO.

4.  Current CEC CWO2s and CWO3s who have not failed to select twice to CWO4 
(designator 753X) have two options for transition.  CWOs may convert to a CEC 
LDO as a designator 653X or retain CWO status.
Grade determinations and dates of rank (DOR) will differ based on years of 
commissioned service (YCS), program option(s), and current policies.
    a.  Conversion to LDO.  CWOs should submit requests for re-designation to 
CEC LDO designator 653X via the CEC Officer Community Manager (OCM) and 
LDO/CWO Community Manager following format per reference (a).  Grade 
determinations for CWOs selected under this option will be based on YCS as 
follows:
        (1) Less than two years:  Appointment to lieutenant junior grade 
(LTJG) upon second commissioning anniversary.
        (2) More than two years but less than four years:
Appointment to lieutenant (LT) upon fourth commissioning anniversary.
        (3) Four or more years:  Appointment to LT in the fiscal year that 
appointment occurs.  Specific DOR will be determined by the Director, 
Military Community Management (BUPERS-3)/Career Progression Division (PERS-8) 
in order to maintain relative seniority of those officers requesting 
appointment as a 653X LT.
    b.  Elect to retain CWO status.  CWOs desiring this option must notify 
the CEC OCM and the LDO/CWO OCM via digitally signed encrypted e-mail at 
jason.n.wood(at)navy.mil and mitchell.allen(at)navy.mil, respectively.  CWOs 
electing to retain CWO status will compete for promotion and be subject to 
the provisions of reference (b).

5.  Officers eligible to apply for transition or those desiring to declare 
permanent warrant officer status must notify the OCMs listed in paragraph 4b 
NLT 60 days following the release of this NAVADMIN.
Officers who take no action by this date will be considered as having opted 
for permanent CWO status and will be subject to laws and policies of active-
duty CWOs.

6.  Billet transitions will take place in two phases to maximize community 
health relative to year group and provide CWOs viable promotion opportunity.
    a.  Phase I will begin 90 days following the release of this NAVADMIN 
with the CEC CWO2/CWO3 billets (designator 753X) being converted to LDO 
(designator 653X) LT and below.
    b.  Phase II will occur at a later date based on CWO inventory and 
promotion opportunity.  CWO4/CWO5 billets will be converted in phases to LDO 
(designator 6530) to maintain a viable career path for CWOs who choose not to 
convert or are ineligible for conversion.
