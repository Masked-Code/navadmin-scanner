4.  Selections are conditional upon the selectee remaining fully eligible in 
all respects, meeting physical qualifications for commissioning as determined 
by the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) and assignment by Naval Service 
Training Command (NSTC) to an approved Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps 
(NROTC) affiliated university based upon an official degree plan and 
acceptance letter from the university.  Upon completion of an NSTC approved 
baccalaureate degree program, selectees will receive appointments as ensigns.

5.  Commanding officers should take the following actions:
    a.  Notify selectees and alternates of their selection and ensure they 
receive a copy of this message.
    b.  Notify NSTC (Officer Development (Selection and Placement) (OD2)/STA-
21) via e-mail no later than 4 November 2017 of any selectee or alternate who 
does not desire to participate in the program.
    c.  Immediately report to NSTC (OD2/STA-21) all conditions/circumstances 
that may disqualify a selectee or alternate from participating in the STA-21 
Program via e-mail at pnsc_sta21@navy.mil.

6.  Selectees and alternates should take the following actions:
    a.  Complete a physical examination for a training program leading to a 
commission in the unrestricted line, nurse corps, or civil engineering corps, 
as applicable, in line with references (a) and (b) at a military treatment 
facility.  Note that many commissioning standards exceed the enlisted 
standards required to remain on active duty.
    b.  Ensure copies of completed physicals, Report of Medical History (DD 
Form 2807-1), and Report of Medical Examination (DD Form 2808), including 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus results from a test taken after 1 January 2017, 
are submitted no later than 1 December 2017 to:

    Naval Service Training Command
    Attn:  OD2/STA-21
    250 Dallas Street, Suite A
    Pensacola, Florida 32508-5268

Aviation option selectees/alternates must have flight physicals uploaded 
directly into Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office by a flight surgeon, and 
submitted to Naval Aerospace Medical Institute. The selectees/alternates must 
be certified as qualified or have a waiver recommended by Naval Medicine 
Operation Training Center.  All required physical forms can be downloaded 
from the STA-21 homepage at https://www.sta-21.navy.mil.  Commands should not 
forward physical forms directly to BUMED.
    c.  Send acceptance letters from no more than three NROTC host or NROTC 
cross-town affiliated universities to the NSTC address listed above.  
Application to more than one university is advisable. Selectees will begin 
the STA-21 Program with attendance at the Naval Science Institute (NSI) no 
later than 13 February 2018.
    d.  Send an official degree plan from an NROTC host or NROTC cross-town 
affiliated university where they have been accepted. Degree plans must cover 
the time actually attending college. Selectees degree plans should begin with 
the summer term 2018.  All STA-21 selectees will be required to attend the 
NSI in route to their assigned university.

7.  Alternates:  Each alternate must complete the same actions outlined in 
paragraph 6 of this message.  If a primary selectee declines participation in 
the program, is determined to be physically disqualified, or otherwise 
becomes ineligible for continuation in the program prior to executing orders, 
a qualified alternate will be selected.  This notification often comes at the 
last minute.  Therefore, alternates need to be prepared if and when notified.

8.  The deadline for required degree plans and college admission 
documentation is 30 December 2017.  It is in the best interest of each 
selectee and alternate to submit verification of eligibility criteria as soon 
as possible to expedite university assignment and release of permanent change 
of station orders.  Selectees will not be ordered to NSI in route to their 
assigned NROTC university until all conditions outlined in paragraph 6 have 
been met.
