GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN SUPERSEDES NAVADMIN 021/03,
AMPLIFIES WAIVERABLE AND NON-WAIVERABLE CRITERIA, ESTABLISHES FINAL
WAIVER AUTHORITY, AND PROVIDES PROCEDURES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE
DOCUMENTATION AND PROCESSING OF TATTOOS/BODY ART/BRANDS/MUTILATIONS/
AND DENTAL ORNAMENTATION.  THESE CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY
AND WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE NEXT CHANGE TO THE UNIFORM REGULATIONS.
2.  FOR CLARITY, REVISIONS AND ADDITIONS TO NAVY UNIFORM
REGULATIONS, ARTICLE 2201, ARE QUOTED BELOW IN THEIR ENTIRETY:
ARTICLE 2201.  PERSONAL APPEARANCE, BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO
PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF EVERY APPROPRIATE OR UNACCEPTABLE
("CONSERVATIVE" OR "ECCENTRIC") GROOMING STANDARD, THE GOOD JUDGMENT
OF LEADERS AT ALL LEVELS IS KEY TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE NAVY S
PERSONAL APPEARANCE POLICY.  THEREFORE, HAIR, GROOMING, AND PERSONAL
APPEARANCE WHILE IN UNIFORM SHALL PRESENT A NEAT, PROFESSIONAL
APPEARANCE.
3.  TATTOOS/BODY ART/BRANDS.  FOUR CRITERIA WILL BE USED TO
DETERMINE WHETHER TATTOOS/BODY ART/BRANDS ARE PERMITTED FOR NAVY
PERSONNEL:  CONTENT, LOCATION, SIZE, AND COSMETIC.
    A.  CONTENT.  TATTOOS/BODY ART/BRANDS LOCATED ANYWHERE ON THE
BODY THAT ARE PREJUDICIAL TO GOOD ORDER, DISCIPLINE, AND MORALE OR
ARE OF A NATURE TO BRING DISCREDIT UPON THE NAVAL SERVICE ARE
PROHIBITED.  FOR EXAMPLE, TATTOOS/BODY ART/BRANDS THAT ARE OBSCENE,
SEXUALLY EXPLICIT, AND OR ADVOCATE DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEX,
RACE, RELIGION, ETHNIC, OR NATIONAL ORIGIN ARE PROHIBITED.  IN
ADDITION, TATTOOS/BODY ART/BRANDS THAT SYMBOLIZE AFFILIATION WITH
GANGS, SUPREMACIST OR EXTREMIST GROUPS, OR ADVOCATE ILLEGAL DRUG USE
ARE PROHIBITED.
    B.  LOCATION.  NO TATTOOS/BODY ART/BRANDS ON THE HEAD, FACE,
NECK, OR SCALP.  THE NECK AREA FOR PURPOSES OF THIS REGULATION IS
ANY PORTION VISIBLE WHEN WEARING A CREW NECK T-SHIRT OR OPEN COLLAR
UNIFORM SHIRT.  IN ADDITION, OTHERWISE PERMISSIBLE TATTOOS/BODY
ART/BRANDS ON THE TORSO AREA OF THE BODY SHALL NOT BE VISIBLE
THROUGH WHITE UNIFORM CLOTHING.
    C.  SIZE.  INDIVIDUAL TATTOOS/BODY ART/BRANDS EXPOSED BY WEARING
A SHORT SLEEVE UNIFORM SHIRT SHALL BE NO LARGER IN SIZE THAN THE

TOUCHING THE BASE OF THE INDEX FINGER.  TATTOOS/BODY ART/BRANDS THAT
EXCEED SIZE CRITERIA ARE WAIVERABLE PROVIDED THEY DO NOT VIOLATE THE
CONTENT AND/OR LOCATION CRITERIA.
    D.  COSMETIC TATTOOS.  THIS REGULATION DOES NOT PROHIBIT
COSMETIC TATTOOING TO CORRECT MEDICAL CONDITIONS REQUIRING SUCH
TREATMENT.  FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS REGULATION, COSMETIC TATTOOING
REFERS TO MEDICAL OR SURGICAL PROCEDURES CONDUCTED BY LICENSED,
QUALIFIED MEDICAL PERSONNEL.
4.  MUTILATION.  INTENTIONAL MUTILATION OF ANY PART OF THE BODY

VENEERED, WILL NOT BE ORNAMENTED WITH DESIGNS, JEWELS, INITIALS,
ETC.
