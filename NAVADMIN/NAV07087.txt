SUBJ/COMMON ACCESS CARD AND PERFORM TO SERVE WEB SITE// 
1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES UPDATED ACCESS PROCEDURES FOR ACCESSING THE 
PERFORM TO SERVE WEBSITE.  PROTECTING BOTH THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF 
OUR SAILORS AND THE INTEGRITY OF OUR COMPUTER NETWORK RESOURCES IS 
CRITICAL.  A KEY ELEMENT OF THIS PROTECTION IS THE USE OF PUBLIC KEY 
INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI) AND THE COMMON ACCESS CARD (CAC) TO VERIFY 
IDENTITY OF USERS AND TO CONTROL ACCESS TO DOD WEB SITES AND 
APPLICATIONS.
2.  TO PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE PERFORM TO 
SERVE (PTS) PROGRAM, USERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM USING 
THEIR COMMON ACCESS CARD THAT CONTAINS THEIR PKI CERTIFICATES.
IMPLEMENTING CAC/PKI ENTRY INTO PTS STRENGTHENS THE DEPTH OF PRIVACY 
ACT AND PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION IN PTS AND REDUCES THE 
VULNERABILITY OF OUR NETWORKS.
3.  EFFECTIVE 14 APRIL 2007, USERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE 
SYSTEM WITHOUT CAC CARDS AND PKI CERTIFICATES.  WHILE THIS SECURITY 
REQUIREMENT PREVENTS USERS FROM ACCESSING PTS FROM THEIR HOME OR PUBLIC 
COMPUTERS (UNLESS THEY HAVE AN INSTALLED CAC READER), IT PROTECTS THE 
VALUABLE PERSONAL INFORMATION HELD IN PTS AND ALLOWS ONLY AUTHORIZED 
USERS TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM.  THE PERFORM TO SERVE COORDINATORS AND 
CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER ARE AWARE OF THIS NEW SECURITY MEASURE AND WILL 
WORK WITH USERS VIA EMAIL, AS APPROPRIATE, TO SUBMIT PTS APPLICATIONS.
4.  THE NAVY KNOWLEDGE ONLINE (NKO), INTEGRATED LEARNING ENVIRONMENT
(ILE), LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (LMS), LEARNING CONTENT MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM (LCMS), AND BUPERS ONLINE (BOL) WEBSITES ARE NOT CURRENTLY 
AFFECTED BY THIS ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION OF CAC/PKI ACCESS.  IN THE 
LONG TERM, SOLUTIONS WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT BALANCE THE NEED FOR BROAD, 
BUT VERIFIABLE, ACCESS TO THESE SYSTEMS AGAINST THE REQUIREMENT TO 
PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS THAT HOLD THIS DATA.
