GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS IS A COORDINATED COMMANDER, NAVAL PERSONNEL

PER REFS A AND B, TFNF IS ESTABLISHING A FULL SPECTRUM COMMUNITY
SERVICE OPERATION TO PROVIDE A RAPID AND COORDINATED RETURN TO A
STABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR NAVY FAMILY MEMBERS ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY
HURRICANE KATRINA.  THIS INCLUDES NAVY CIVIL SERVICE AND
NON-APPROPRIATED FUND CIVILIANS, ACTIVE DUTY/SELECTED RESERVES
(SELRES) MILITARY, AND THEIR DEPENDENTS.  TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF
NAVY FAMILY KATRINA VICTIMS, VERIFICATION OF CONTACT DATA AND A
NEEDS ASSESSMENT ARE NECESSARY FOR TFNF TO MAINTAIN REAL TIME
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS ON OUR KATRINA AFFECTED FAMILIES.  THIS EFFORT
WILL HELP TFNF PRIORITIZE EFFORTS AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO HELP
THOSE WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS SOONEST.  THIS NAVADMIN PROMULGATES
SPECIFIC GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE TFNF NEEDS ASSESSMENT
DATA CALL USING THE BUPERS ONLINE (BOL) WEBSITE AT WWW.BOL.NAVY.MIL.
THE NAVY HAS ALSO ESTABLISHED A 24 HOUR HELPLINE AT 1-(877)
414-5358 FOR KATRINA RECOVERY ASSISTANCE.
2.  THE BOL WEBSITE IS AVAILABLE COMMENCING 211400Z SEP 05 (0800 CDT
21SEP05) FOR COMMANDS WITH KATRINA AFFECTED FAMILIES TO VERIFY
MUSTER DATA AND UPDATE CONTACT INFORMATION ON THEIR KATRINA AFFECTED

THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE, NOT LATER THAN 222300Z SEP 05 (1700
CDT 22SEP05) USING PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN PARAGRAPH 3 BELOW.
    A.  INDIVIDUAL NAVY FAMILY MEMBERS ALSO REQUIRING ASSISTANCE ARE
HIGHLY ENCOURAGED TO ACCESS THE BOL WEBSITE AT WWW.BOL.NAVY.MIL TO
ALSO COMPLETE OR VALIDATE/RE-VALIDATE THEIR FAMILY NEEDS PROFILE.
COMMANDS ARE TO ENSURE THAT EACH KATRINA AFFECTED INDIVIDUAL/FAMILY

DISPLACED PERSONNEL CAN KEEP A CONTACT PHONE NUMBER, E-MAIL ADDRESS
OR STREET ADDRESS ON FILE.
3.  COMMANDING OFFICERS, OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVE, WILL LOG INTO
THEIR EXISTING BOL ACCOUNT AND SELECT "KATRINA MUSTER".
INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION ARE INCLUDED ON THE

UNITS MEMBERS.
4.  INSTRUCTION FOR NAVY FAMILY MEMBERS (NAVY CIVILIAN, ACTIVE
DUTY/SELRES MILITARY, AND THEIR FAMILIES):
    A.  NAVY MILITARY OR CIVILIANS MAY REGISTER THEIR CONTACT
INFORMATION AND CURRENT LOCATION ON BOL AT WWW.BOL.NAVY.MIL BY

OUTSIDE THE TFNF AOR WHO HAVE DEPENDENTS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY
KATRINA, THE DON EMPLOYEE (NAVY CIVIL SERVICE AND NON-APPROPRIATED
FUND CIVILIANS, ACTIVE DUTY/SELRES MILITARY) SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE
DATA ON THEIR DEPENDENTS.
    B.  NAVY MILITARY SHOULD USE THEIR CURRENT BOL ACCOUNTS.  FOR

AFFECTED NAVY FAMILY MEMBERS BY 232300Z SEP 05 (1700 CDT 23SEP05).
ALTHOUGH BOTH COMMANDS AND INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE PROVIDED DATA IN
EARLIER KATRINA RECOVERY EFFORTS, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT DATA ON ALL
NAVY FAMILY VICTIMS OF KATRINA IS VERIFIED IN ORDER FOR TFNF TO
MAXIMIZE THE SUCCESS OF EFFORTS.  THEREFORE, ALL COMMANDS IN THE
TFNF AOR AND ALL OTHER COMMANDS WITH KATRINA AFFECTED FAMILIES MUST
PROACTIVELY ENGAGE IN THIS EFFORT.  USE ALL MEANS AVAILABLE TO
COMMUNICATE THIS REQUIREMENT TO ALL NAVY FAMILY MEMBERS  (NAVY CIVIL
SERVICE AND NON-APPROPRIATED FUND CIVILIANS, ACTIVE DUTY/SELRES
MILITARY, AND THEIR FAMILIES).
6.  FOR COMMANDING OFFICERS:  IF YOU OR YOUR PERSONNEL HAVE ALREADY
BEEN CALLED BY A MEMBER OF TFNF OR SOMEONE FROM COMNAVPERSCOM TO
ASSESS THEIR NEEDS IN RESPONSE TO HURRICANE KATRINA WE ASK THAT YOU
STILL LOG INTO BOL TO VERIFY THE INFORMATION IS CORRECT AND MAKE ANY
CHANGES.  THOSE PHONE CALLS WERE INITIATED TO ASSESS YOUR NEEDS AS A
CONTINUING PROCESS, NOT AS THE FINAL CONTACT.  ADDITIONALLY, YOU
WILL BE ABLE TO VIEW NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOR YOUR COMMAND AS IT EVOLVES
VIA BOL COMMAND ACCESS OUTLINED IN PARAGRAPH 3.
7.  FOR ALL FAMILY MEMBERS:  THE PURPOSE OF THE BOL FAMILY MEMBER
PROFILE IS TO RAPIDLY COLLECT/COLLATE EXISTING INFORMATION
MAINTAINED BY THE NAVY IN OTHER OFFICIAL DATABASES (SUCH AS DEERS)
TOGETHER WITH THE MOST CURRENT FAMILY LOCATOR INFORMATION AVAILABLE
SO THAT WE MAY RAPIDLY AND EFFECTIVELY ACCOUNT FOR OUR FAMILIES AND
ADDRESS FAMILY NEEDS TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY DURING THESE
CHALLENGING TIMES.  THIS INFORMATION WILL BE SAFEGUARDED USING
ESTABLISHED/EVOLVING INFORMATION SECURITY PRACTICES AND IN KEEPING
WITH ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT PRIVACY ACT PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES.
THESE PROCEDURES WILL EVOLVE TO SUPPORT ALL NAVY FAMILIES AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE.
