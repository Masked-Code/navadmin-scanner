SUBJ/UNITED STATES NAVAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE INTEGRATED NAVAL STUDIES 
CERTIFICATE COHORT CALL FOR APPLICATIONS// 
 
RMKS/1. This NAVADMIN announces a United States Naval Community 
College (USNCC) Integrated Naval Studies Certificate pilot program. 
In order to assess the relevance of the Naval Studies Certificate 
to Integrated Navy and Marine Corps operating forces, USNCC is 
soliciting applications for a cohort of 250 Sailors and Marines 
with specific operational experience in a naval integrated 
environment, starting 28 May 2023 and concluding 12 May 2024. 
This will allow command leadership and students to provide critical 
feedback to USNCC during the program and upon completion of the 
course of instruction. 
 
2. Program. The cohort will participate in the five college-level 
courses that comprise the Naval Studies Certificate: Naval Ethics 
and Leadership; Modern Naval History; Naval Force Design; 
Civilian/Military Relations, Organization, and American Government; 
and Introduction to the Geopolitical Environment. Each course will 
be delivered asynchronously online at no-cost to the student or the 
command and is intended to be completed in the service member's 
off-duty time. Additional information on the USNCC Naval Studies 
Certificate, including course descriptions, may be found on the 
USNCC website at https://www.usncc.edu/Academics/Degree-Programs/Naval-
Studies-Certificate/. 
 
3. Eligibility. This pilot cohort is open to any Sailor or Marine 
who meets the requirements listed below. Future convenings of 
this program will be available more broadly. 
   a. Current or prior operational experience in an integrated 
naval operational environment within the last two tours or 
assignments. Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG), Marine Expeditionary 
Force (MEF), Amphibious Readiness Group (ARG), Marine Expeditionary 
Unit (MEU) or similar task organizations are examples of operational 
naval integrated commands. 
   b. Prior completion of English 101, College-Level Examination 
Program (CLEP), High School AP English, or equivalent. Commanding 
Officers may waive this requirement if an otherwise qualified 
Sailor or Marine demonstrates strong written communications skills. 
 
4. Nomination and Selection. Between 14 February and 31 March 
2023 commands will screen and nominate eligible Sailors and 
Marines to USNCC. 
   a. Nomination implies command endorsement and confirms that 
nominees have sufficient time, interest, and ability to complete 
all five college-level courses while at the current command. 
   b. For this cohort, completion of the certificate at the current 
command is imperative to receive timely command feedback, measure 
operational readiness, and allow time for students to make an 
impact in their current role as a result of certificate program 
completion. 
   c. Selection and notification will begin 24 April 2023 and 
conclude NLT 15 May 2023. 
   d. Commands may submit nominations electronically via the USNCC 
website at https://www.usncc.edu/. Nominations should be entered 
by command representatives at the E-8, E-9 or O-4 and above level. 
 
5. Program Completion. Upon successful completion of the program, 
students will be awarded the prestigious Naval Studies Certificate 
awarded by the USNCC President, Master Chief Petty Officer of the 
Navy and Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps. 
   a. College credit will be awarded for the successful completion 
of these courses and may be applied to undergraduate-level degree 
programs. 
   b. Students who desire to pursue an associate degree in a 
naval-relevant concentration area offered by the USNCC will receive 
priority placement for admission upon successful completion of this 
USNCC Certificate program. 
 
6. Point of Contact. For any questions regarding the pilot program 
or the Naval Studies Certificate, please contact Mr. Alphonso
