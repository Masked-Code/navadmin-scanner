RMKS/1.  THIS MESSAGE PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE NEW TRANSITION PROCESS FOR 
ACTIVE COMPONENT (AC) AND FULL TIME SUPPORT (FTS) SAILORS APPROVED FOR 
SELECTED RESERVES (SELRES) VIA PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) OR EARLY CAREER 
TRANSITION PROGRAM (ECTP).  TO ENSURE A MORE EFFICIENT AND TIMELY TRANSITION 
FOR OUR SAILORS TO AFFILIATE WITH THE RESERVES, SAILORS MUST COMPLETE THE 
FOLLOWING STEPS AT LEAST 60 DAYS PRIOR TO TRANSITION DATE TO RECEIVE 
SEPARATION ORDERS WITH INTERMEDIATE STOP
(I-STOP) TO THEIR REQUESTED NAVY OPERATIONAL SUPPORT CENTER (NOSC):
    A.  PER REFS A AND B, AFTER APPROVAL OF SELRES PTS OR ECTP, SAILORS MUST 
LOG ON TO CAREER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - INTERACTIVE DETAILING (CMS/ID) AND SELECT 
A NOSC NEAREST TO THE AREA THEY INTEND TO RESIDE AFTER THEIR RELEASE FROM 
ACTIVE DUTY.
    B.  SAILORS/COMMAND CAREER COUNSELORS MUST COMPLETE A RESERVE AFFILIATION 
SCREENING CHECKLIST AND CONTACT INFORMATION SHEET AND FORWARD THEM TO THE 
CAREER TRANSITION OFFICE (CTO) AT CTO.ENLISTED(AT)NAVY.MIL (PREFERRED METHOD) 
OR VIA FAX (901) 874-2186 TO ENSURE THE COMPLETION OF ALL REQUIRED 
ENLISTMENT/AFFILIATION DOCUMENTS PRIOR TO THE SAILOR STARTING TERMINAL LEAVE.

2.  FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE ABOVE ACTIONS AT LEAST 60 DAYS PRIOR TO TRANSITION 
DATE WILL RESULT IN TRANSITION TO SELRES WITHOUT NPC ISSUED SEPARATION ORDERS.  
SELRES PTS QUOTAS REMAIN VALID UNTIL 60 DAYS AFTER EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE 
OBLIGATED SERVICE (EAOS).  ECTP QUOTAS WILL REMAIN VALID, BUT SAILORS WILL 
COMPLETE SEPARATION PROCESSING AT THEIR ACTIVE COMPONENT COMMAND VICE AT THEIR 
NOSC AND WILL HAVE LOCALLY ISSUED SEPARATION TRAVEL ORDERS ISSUED USING 
NAVPERS 1900/2 SEPARATION TRAVEL ORDERS FORM IN LIEU OF NPC ISSUED SEPARATION 
ORDERS.

3.  IF SAILORS COMPLETE REQUIRED ACTIONS AT LEAST 60 DAYS PRIOR TO TRANSITION 
DATE, PERS-4012 WILL ISSUE I-STOP ORDERS, TRANSFERRING THE MEMBER IN AN ACTIVE 
DUTY STATUS FROM THEIR CURRENT COMMAND TO THE APPROVED NOSC.  TYPICALLY, THESE 
SEPARATION ORDERS WILL AUTHORIZE TRAVEL TIME ONLY TO THE NOSC WITH SEPARATION 
LEAVE UTILIZED AFTER CHECKING INTO THE NOSC.  THESE ORDERS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED 
VIA MESSAGE AND WILL BE AVAILABLE IN BUPERS ONLINE AND THE CAREER INFORMATION 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (CIMS) TO ALLOW SPONSOR ASSIGNMENTS.
THE PERSONNEL SUPPORT DETACHMENT (PSD) SUPPORTING THE FLEET COMMAND WILL 
PREPARE THE DD214 WORKSHEET AND PROVIDE TO SAILOR PRIOR TO TRANSFER.  THE PSD 
SUPPORTING THE GAINING NOSC WILL COMPLETE THE REMAINDER OF ACTIVE DUTY 
SEPARATION PROCESS.  SAILORS AFFILIATING WITH A NOSC GREATER THAN 50 MILES 
FROM THEIR RESIDENCE ARE AUTHORIZED UP TO THREE DAYS OF PER DIEM WHILE 
COMPLETING SEPARATION PROCESSING AT THE NOSC.

4.  EARLY COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION (SAILOR'S PROJECTED SEPARATION LEAVE, 
CONTACT INFO, ETC.) BETWEEN THE COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR AND THE CTO ARE KEY 
ELEMENTS IN EFFECTING A SEAMLESS TRANSITION TO THE SELRES.
