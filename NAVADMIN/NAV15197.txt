SUBJ/2015 VICE ADMIRAL JAMES BOND STOCKDALE LEADERSHIP AWARD WINNERS//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the 2015 recipients of the Vice Admiral 
James Bond Stockdale award.  Commander Matthew J. Duffy, Commanding Officer 
of VAW-112 (Pacific Fleet) and CDR Anthony S. Grayson, Commanding Officer of 
USS Providence (SSN 719) (Fleet Forces Command) were selected for their 
inspirational leadership.

2.  This fleet award was established in honor of VADM James Bond Stockdale, 
whose distinguished naval career symbolized the highest standards of 
excellence in both personal example and leadership. The award is presented 
annually to two commissioned officers on active duty in the grade of 
commander or below who are serving in command of a single ship, submarine, 
aviation squadron, Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) team, naval special warfare 
squadron, SEAL delivery vehicle team, special boat team, explosive ordnance 
disposal mobile unit, mobile diving and salvage unit, or Navy special 
clearance team during the nomination cycle.  Candidates are nominated by 
peers who themselves must be eligible for the award.

3.  The 2015 winners were chosen from among eight outstanding finalists in a 
review process that included screening at the Fleet Commander level and final 
selection by a board of senior officers.

4.  The following finalists deserve well-earned congratulations:
    a.  Pacific Fleet finalists:
        - CDR Kelly T. Fletcher, Commanding Officer,
          USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49)
        - CDR John P. Friedman, former Commanding Officer,
          USS Columbia (SSN 771)
        - CDR Katrina L. Hill, former Commanding Officer, VP-9

        - CDR Mikal J. Phillips, Commanding Officer,

5.  CDR Matthew J. Duffy and CDR Anthony S. Grayson, as well as all nominees, 
should be justifiably proud of their achievements.

6.  Awards will be presented at a ceremony to be determined at a later date.

7.  This NAVADMIN will be canceled for record purposes on 30 November 2015.
