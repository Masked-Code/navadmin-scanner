REF/C/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/261710ZJUL12//
NARR/REFERENCE A IS MILPERSMAN 1306-1002, GUARANTEED ASSIGNMENT RETENTION 
DETAILING (GUARD 2000) PROGRAM.  REFERENCE B IS MILPERSMAN 1306-1004, 
GUARANTEED ASSIGNMENT RETENTION DETAILING (GUARD 2000) PROGRAM FOR NUCLEAR 
TRAINED PERSONNEL.  REFERENCE C IS NAVADMIN 226/12, CHANGES IN ENLISTED
DISTRIBUTION TO IMPROVE SEA DUTY MANNING.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces cancellation of references (a) and (b).

2.  The GUARD 2000 programs are retention tools that were established in 1998 
and provided for two guaranteed assignments during a career.  With the Career
Management System/Interactive Detailing (CMS/ID) business rules established 
in reference (c) and the Optimized Fleet Response Plan, GUARD 2000 is no 
longer applicable.  Additionally, one of the main tenants of GUARD 2000 was 
the waiver of up to 18 months of sea duty.  This contradicts our current 
manning initiatives such as early return to sea, Voluntary Sea Duty Program,
and increasing use of Sea Duty Incentive Pay programs.  The primary objective
of these programs is to minimize gaps at sea, not curtail sea tours.

3.  The GUARD 2000 program does not align with current CMS/ID business rules
and initiatives.

4.  Points of contact for additional information is Navy Personnel Command
Customer Service Center (NPC CSC), at 1-866-u-ask-npc or via e-mail at 
uasknpc(at)navy.mil.
