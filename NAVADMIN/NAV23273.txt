SUBJ/2023 VETERANS DAY MESSAGE//

RMKS/1.  Team Navy: Today the words service and sacrifice take on special 
significance as we honor the many Americans, past and present, who have taken 
up the profession of arms to defend our great Nation.

2.  We commemorate Veterans Day because it is our sacred obligation as a 
country to recognize our veterans, to remember what they have fought and died 
for, and to reaffirm our commitment to the values that inspired their 
service.

3.  Today, we also extend our gratitude to the families and support networks 
who enable service members to deploy wherever needed around the world.  We 
think about the caregivers who attend to our veterans and ensure they are 
treated with dignity and respect.  And our thoughts and prayers go out to the 
survivors of all those who laid down their life for their country.

4.  On this Veterans Day, I thank all of you on our Navy team for raising 
your hand and taking the oath to support and defend our Constitution.  I ask 
all of us to remain faithful to our veterans, to continue to earn the trust 
and confidence of the American people, and to serve every day with honor, 
courage, and commitment.
You represent the warfighting spirit of the Navy and those who have gone 
before us to defend freedom around the world.

5.  I'm proud to serve alongside you and to commemorate this Veterans Day 
with you.
