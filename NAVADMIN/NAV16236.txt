commission in the unrestricted line, Nurse Corps, or Civil Engineering Corps,

(DD2807-1), and Report of Medical Examination (DD2808), including Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus results from a test taken after 1 January 2016, are

Operation Training Center.  All required physical forms can be downloaded 
from the STA-21 homepage at http://www.sta-21.navy.mil.  Commands should not

later than 13 February 2017.
    d.  Send an official degree plan from an NROTC host or NROTC cross-town 
affiliated university where they have been accepted. Degree plans must cover 
the time actually attending college. Selectees degree plans should begin with 
the Summer term 2017.  All STA-21 selectees will be required to attend the 
NSI en route to their assigned university.

7.  Alternates:  While there is no guarantee that an alternate will be 
offered the opportunity to replace a primary selectee, each alternate must 
complete the same actions outlined in paragraph 6 of this message.  If a 
primary selectee declines participation in the program, is determined to be 
physically disqualified, or otherwise becomes ineligible for continuation in 
the program prior to executing orders, a qualified alternate will be 
selected.  This notification often comes at the last minute.  Therefore, 
alternates need to be prepared if and when notified.

8.  The deadline for required degree plans and college admission 
documentation is 30 December 2016.  It is in the best interest of each 
selectee and alternate to submit verification of eligibility criteria as soon

assigned NROTC university until all conditions outlined in paragraph 6 have
