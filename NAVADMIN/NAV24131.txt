SUBJ/INDEPENDENCE DAY MESSAGE//

RMKS/1.  To all Sailors, Marines, and civilians serving on our Navy-Marine 
Corps team:

2.  As we celebrate our Nation's Independence Day, it is worth reflecting on 
America's Warfighting Navy and how we promote prosperity and security, deter 
aggression, and protect the American way of life.

3.  Our history of action from John Paul Jones and the Continental Navy to 
the recent operations by the Gerald R. Ford and Eisenhower Strike Groups as 
well as the Bataan Amphibious Ready Group underscores the pivotal role our 
Navy plays in upholding peace, responding in crisis, and when necessary 
winning decisively in war - for 248 years.  From the launching of the 
original six frigates, to the hallowed shores of Normandy and the perilous 
waters at Midway, from the dawn of the nuclear age to the unforgiving terrain 
of the Mekong Delta, or ashore in Iraq and Afghanistan, the valor and 
resilience of our Naval forces have served as the bedrock of our Nation's 
defense.

4.  This legacy endures in the form of democratic ideals upheld - our global 
operations, far forward, bolster our leverage, providing space for diplomatic 
options that will always be more favorable than war.
Sailors and Marines continue to serve as pillars of strength for our nation, 
embodying the ethos of selflessness and duty.

5.  We extend our deepest gratitude to each of you and, your families for 
your service to our great nation.  Your unwavering commitment to service 
exemplifies the finest traditions of our armed forces and serves as a beacon 
of inspiration for future generations.  We wish you and your loved ones a 
happy, safe, and patriotic Independence Day.

6.  Released by ADM L. M. Franchetti, Chief of Naval Operations and MCPON J. 
M. Honea, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy.
