THE TRANSITION GOALS, PLANS, SUCCEED (GPS) PROGRAM.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES 
THE UPDATED REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (TAP) AS 
MANDATED BY LAW.

2.  REFS A AND B ARE INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE THE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES OF 
SEPARATING SERVICE MEMBERS AND ENHANCE THEIR TRANSITION PROCESS.  REF C 
MANDATES ALL SERVICE MEMBERS SEPARATING AFTER SERVING 180 DAYS OR MORE OF 
ACTIVE DUTY MUST PARTICIPATE IN A TAP THAT INCLUDES PRE-SEPARATION COUNSELING, 
THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (DOL) EMPLOYMENT WORKSHOP, AND VETERAN'S BENEFITS 
BRIEFING.

3.  PER REF C, THE FOLLOWING SERVICE MEMBERS MAY BE EXEMPT FROM ATTENDING THE 
DOL WORKSHOP PORTION ONLY (PRE-SEPARATION COUNSELING AND VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA) 
BENEFITS BRIEF REQUIRED FOR ALL
PERSONNEL):
    A.  SERVICE MEMBERS RETIRING WITH 20 OR MORE YEARS OF ACTIVE FEDERAL 
SERVICE.
    B.  MEMBERS OF THE RESERVE COMPONENT WHO ARE BEING DEMOBILIZED OR 
DEACTIVATED AFTER SERVING 180 CONTINUOUS DAYS OR MORE ON ACTIVE DUTY, IF THEY

PARTICIPATION.  IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT TRANSITION GPS QUOTAS BE

REPRESENTATIVE AND FILED IN MEMBER'S SERVICE RECORD.  THE FORM IS AVAILABLE AT
