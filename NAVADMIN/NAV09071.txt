RMKS/1. THIS MESSAGE ANNOUNCES THE 2009 CALENDAR FOR AMERICA (CFA), 
LISTING THE NAVY'S LARGE-SCALE CONUS OUTREACH EVENTS FOR THE COMING 
YEAR. EVENTS INCLUDE NAVY WEEKS, FLEET WEEKS, DIVERSITY EVENTS, BLUE 
ANGELS AIR SHOWS, SHIP COMMISSIONINGS, AND KEY RECRUITING EVOLUTIONS 
AMONG MANY OTHERS.
2. THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS (CNO) HAS A STRONG DESIRE TO TELL THE 
NAVY STORY TO AMERICA AND HAS DIRECTED A MORE STRATEGIC APPROACH TO THE
DEVELOPMENT AND DELIVERY OF THAT MESSAGE. CNO INTENT FOR CFA 2009 IS AS 
FOLLOWS:
A. VISION: EDUCATE AND INFORM KEY AUDIENCES TO ENHANCE PUBLIC AWARENESS 
AND UNDERSTANDING -- ESPECIALLY IN NON-FLEET CONCENTRATION AREAS -- OF 
OUR MISSION AND EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE IN SUPPORT OF OUR NATION AT WAR.
(1) USE TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY RELATIONS TACTICS, AMPLIFIED BY LOCAL AND
REGIONAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT, AUGMENTED BY SOCIAL NETWORKING AND NEWS 
MEDIA.
(2) COORDINATE A SERIES OF ENGAGEMENTS HIGHLIGHTING OUR SAILORS, FLEET
CAPABILITIES, AND PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES.
(3) UTILIZE PUBLIC SPEAKING EVENTS, MUSICAL PERFORMANCES, CAPABILITY
DEMONSTRATIONS, AND CREATIVE MECHANISMS.
(4) REFINE AND EXECUTE A CALENDAR OF NAVY ENGAGEMENTS THAT LEVERAGES
EXISTING COMMUNITY EVENTS, TO OPTIMIZE NAVY PERSONNEL INTERACTION WITH 
CIVILIAN MEDIA AND INFLUENCERS.
(5) INCLUDE SENIOR FLAG LEADERSHIP AMONG ALL ECHELONS OF COMMAND AND 
RANKS OF PERSONNEL.
B. KEY TASKS:
(1) FIRST AND FOREMOST, EDUCATE AMERICANS ABOUT THE MARITIME STRATEGY.
(2) HIGHLIGHT THE COURAGEOUS AND DEDICATED SERVICE OF OUR PERSONNEL. 
DEMONSTRATE NAVY CAPABILITIES USING THE BLUE ANGELS, TACTICAL 
DEMONSTRATIONS, LEAP FROGS, NAVY BANDS, AND MYRIAD RECRUITING ASSETS 
AMONG OTHERS.
(3) CONSIDER SPECIFIC RECRUITING NEEDS, BUT FOCUS BROADLY ON EDUCATING 
AND INFORMING THE U.S. PUBLIC AT LARGE.
(4) DIVERSITY THEMES SHALL BE KEY IN OUR MESSAGE.
(5) EMPHASIZE SHIPS' NAMESAKE CONNECTIONS, SAILORS' HOMETOWN TIES, 
CULTURAL UNIQUENESS AND INDUSTRIAL INTERESTS AS WELL AS OTHER LOCAL 
MARKET UNIQUENESS.
C. NAVY WEEK EMPHASIS: CNO IS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE NAVY WEEK 
PROGRAM. NAVY WEEKS, OUR FLAGSHIP MIDDLE-AMERICA OUTREACH ACTIVITY IS 
LED BY CHINFO'S NAVY OFFICE OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH (NAVCO) IN 
PARTNERSHIP WITH NAVY RECRUITING DISTRICTS. CNO HAS ASKED MORE SENIOR 
FLAG LEADERSHIP TO ENGAGE. ACCORDINGLY, THIS EFFORT WILL REQUIRE 
INCREASED SUPPORT FROM THE FLEET IN TERMS OF LEADERS
TO SEA VISITS (SUB, SURFACE, AND CARRIER) AND EXPANDED HOMETOWN NEWS
COVERAGE FROM FORWARD DEPLOYED SHIPS AND UNITS, AS WELL AS INCREASED 
NAMESAKE SHIP VISITS TO NAVY WEEK CITIES. NAVY WEEK RELATIONSHIPS WILL 
PROVIDE INCREASINGLY STEADY-STATE AND CONSISTENT ENGAGEMENT THROUGHOUT 
THE YEAR. THE NAVY WEEK 2009 PROGRAM EMBRACES THE EXPEDITIONARY MINDSET, 
WITH NEARLY 50 PERCENT OF THE NAVY WEEK SCHEDULE BEING IN FIRST-EVER 
NAVY WEEK LOCATIONS. ALL WILL EMPHASIZE KEY THEMES SUCH AS MARITIME 
STRATEGY, SELFLESS SERVICE, AND DIVERSITY.
