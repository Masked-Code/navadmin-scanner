RMKS/1.  The Naval Helicopter Association (NHA) will hold its annual national 
symposium in San Diego, CA at the Town and Country Hotel from 11-15 May 2015.  
The 2015 theme for the symposium is "Forward Firing and Lethal."

2.  NHA membership is more than 2,800 strong, consisting of active duty, 
reserve, and retired personnel committed to the goal of enhancing the 
professionalism of military members working in the field of navy, marine and 
coast guard vertical lift aviation.  The NHA annual symposium provides 
opportunity for expansive discussion on a broad range of professional and 
career topics of interest to its extensive and diverse membership.  It is a 
forum in which attendees come together to present innovative solutions to 
current and future warfighting issues and challenges.

3.  Per reference (a), a limited use of government funds to attend NHA 2015 
has been approved.  The following restrictions apply:
    a.  Local attendance at no cost to the Department of the Navy (DON) is 
authorized with supervisors' approval.
    b.  The number of participants attending in a Temporary Additional Duty 
(TAD) status on cost orders is capped at 168 and cannot exceed $228,000 total 
cost.  Travel, lodging and per diem has been approved for a select number of 
attendees as approved in reference (a). Commander, Naval Air Force, Pacific 
(COMNAVAIRPAC) is in charge of tracking all TAD attendees for the DON.  
Attendees from commands outside COMNAVAIRPAC shall contact the point of 
contacts (POCs) listed prior to obligating TAD funds to ensure total cost to 
DON remains within pre-approved guidelines.  Personnel approved still need to 
gain TAD authorization from the first Flag in their respective Chain of 
Command.  (Note:  registration on the NHA website does not constitute 
approval to travel using funds authorized in reference (a); travel must be 
coordinated with COMNAVAIRPAC).

Questions regarding San Diego, CA area transportation should be forwarded to

vouchers if meals are provided by the conference host.

4.  In addition, all Commanding Officers are authorized to grant non-funded, 
no cost TAD orders at their discretion to the extent consistent with Navy 
policy.
