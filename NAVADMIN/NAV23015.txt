RMKS/1. Chief of Naval Operations has designated Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces 
Command (COMUSFLTFORCOM) as the supported Commander to lead a SPRINT 
addressing the number, distribution, and care of the Navy's Limited Duty 
(LIMDU) and Disability Evaluation System (DES) Sailors throughout the Navy. 
The SPRINT will work in parallel to an existing OPNAV N1 led effort to 
address LIMDU and DES, and will focus on taking immediate action to improve 
the oversight and management of LIMDU personnel and alleviate the friction in 
the LIMDU process. In order to achieve the desired end state, a  
Cross-Functional Team (CFT) of stakeholders is working to identify specific 
actions to improve our LIMDU process and will report back to me no later than 
28 February 2023. In the interim, the following guidance will empower 
commanders (CDRs), commanding officers (COs), and officers-in-charge (OICs) 
to set the foundation for positive Navy-wide actions targeted at the LIMDU 
Sailor population. 
 
2. The Navy must shift from a passive to an active posture on both LIMDU and 
DES management. LIMDU and DES Sailors are a valuable and permanent part of 
our Navy. Their primary mission is returning to full duty or departing the 
service with dignity. They deserve the full support and focused commitment of 
their leadership team. In all cases, when Sailors either become LIMDU or are 
assigned to a new command in a LIMDU status, leadership must fully integrate 
these Sailors into all aspects of the command to the maximum extent 
practical. CDRs, COs, and OICs remain responsible to facilitate and ensure 
LIMDU Sailors attend all of their necessary medical and administrative 
appointments, which is their primary mission. As such, leadership must be 
thoughtful and deliberate in assigning duties, which can be completed between 
appointments, actively support the command's mission, and reinforce the 
importance of each Sailor to the command. Active case management will require 
action from Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) and Navy Personnel 
Command (PERS) to provide proper training and education on LIMDU and DES 
management and increase precision in the distribution of LIMDU and DES 
Sailors as vetted by the TYCOM and ISIC. Finally, in instances where command 
leadership is charged with the responsibility of leading Sailors requiring 
added support (e.g., non-ambulatory, acute treatment requirements, out-of-
rate with no employment opportunities, etc.), it is imperative that the chain 
of command elevate concerns in a timely manner, for barrier removal and 
resolution by higher echelon. 
 
3. Immediate actions assigned by COMUSFLTFORCOM as the Supported Commander to 
be completed NLT 28 February 2023: 
a. Per ref (a), all commands are required to appoint a Deployability 
Coordinator (DC). 
b. Effective with the release of this message, COMUSFLTFORCOM directs that 
all Navy commands with a LIMDU population in excess of 50 Sailors SHALL 
appoint a DC as a primary duty. 
c. For Navy commands with a LIMDU population less than 50 Sailors, the DC may 
be appointed as a collateral duty. 
d. Commands SHALL appoint additional primary or collateral duty DCs as 
necessary to ensure that the ratio of DCs to LIMDU Sailors does not exceed 
1:50. 
e. Commands SHALL review both refs (a) and (b) to ensure full compliance with 
the current policy regarding LIMDU and DES Sailors. 
f. Commands SHALL proactively update their command manning documents to 
accurately reflect the status of LIMDU and DES Sailors. Leadership SHALL 
coordinate with Navy Medical Readiness and Training Command (NMRTC) and PERS-
45, the subject matter experts on policy matters, in updating their command 
manning documents. This will remediate a significant factor in the 
enterprise-wide confusion regarding the number and distribution of LIMDU 
Sailors that arise when Sailors are assigned incorrect accounting category 
code (ACC) or Navy enlisted classification (NEC) codes. 
g. To help in executing the above actions, CDRs, COs, OICs, and other triad 
members are required to review the existing CO's Tool Kit for  
Non-Deployability located on the MyNavyHR website, located at the following:  
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Detailing/Deployability/.  
Awareness of available resources, the common lexicon and terminology, and 
basic deployability determination process will empower CDRs, COs, and OICs to 
more effectively manage their LIMDU and DES Sailors. 
h. Reporting instructions on completion of steps in paragraphs 3a through 3c 
will be promulgated SEPCOR. 
 
4. Next steps: 
a. The LIMDU and DES CFT will examine areas of the LIMDU and DES process that 
are outside of the CDRs, COs, and OICs' ability to control. The first 
challenge for the CFT is to look at the 
distribution of LIMDU and DES Sailors with the goal of improving the 
precision of the LIMDU distribution process. Additionally, the process for 
placing LIMDU and DES Sailors in-rate must be scrutinized. Factors such as 
rank, berthing accommodations, command mission, opportunities to conduct in-
rate work, and the ability/inability of the individual to conduct such work 
must be assessed by respective TYCOMs/ISICs in conjunction with  
PERS-40/PERS-45 as appropriate, to be validated by the receiving command 
prior to Sailors arrival. 
b. For the command DCs, the LIMDU and DES CFT will direct that formal 
education be established and standardized by BUMED and PERS to be facilitated 
by NMRTC no later than 28 February 2023. At a minimum, the training will 
cover the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
guidance, Privacy Act guidance, and guidance for frontline supervisors on how 
to engage their Sailors without violating confidentiality standards. The 
purpose of the training is to ensure that DCs have the necessary tools to 
help their LIMDU Sailors return to service, not to further restrict 
information from the command. In addition to the formalized training, the 
NMRTC will establish and promulgate a training plan no later than 28 February 
2023 for DCs to develop the ability to review current cases with enough 
information and detail to assess the progress of LIMDU and DES Sailors in 
their path to recovery or separation in accordance with ref (a). 
 
5. The LIMDU and DES CFT has already started gathering data from the Fleet on 
the challenges faced by the CDRs, COs, and OICs in executing the LIMDU and 
DES process as currently established in policy. This CFT will conduct a 
SPRINT to refine and improve areas accessible in the short term and then hand 
off the long term process improvements to the OPNAV N1 led effort.
