RESERVE COMPONENT TO ACTIVE COMPONENT.  REF B IS MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1326-021 
THAT OUTLINES THE NAVY ENLISTED RESERVE COMPONENT TO ACTIVE COMPONENT 
AUGMENTATION PROGRAM.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES A NEW INITIATIVE FOR THE NAVY ENLISTED 
RESERVE COMPONENT TO ACTIVE COMPONENT AUGMENTATION PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS 
QUALIFIED RESERVE COMPONENT SAILORS IN SPECIFIC RATINGS AND YEAR GROUPS (YG) 
TO VOLUNTEER TO TRANSITION TO THE ACTIVE COMPONENT.  THIS IS NOT A RECALL TO 
ACTIVE DUTY FOR A FINITE PERIOD OF TIME, VOLUNTEER MEMBERS WHO ARE SELECTED 
ARE AUGMENTED TO THE ACTIVE COMPONENT, EXECUTE A NEW ACTIVE COMPONENT 
ENLISTMENT AGREEMENT, AND COMPETE FOR ADVANCEMENT AS PART OF THE ACTIVE 
COMPONENT.

2.  THE NAVY CONTINUES TO IMPROVE EXISTING AND DEVELOP NEW PROCESSES DESIGNED 
TO TRANSITION SAILORS BETWEEN THE RESERVE COMPONENT AND ACTIVE COMPONENT.  IN 
ADDITION TO AFFORDING MEMBERS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE ON ACTIVE DUTY, 
SUCH PROGRAMS ENABLE THE NAVY TO MANAGE ITS FORCE SO IT IS BETTER SUITED TO 
MEET PRESENT AND FUTURE WARFIGHTING REQUIREMENTS.  "FORCE MANAGEMENT" IS A 
COMPREHENSIVE TERM WHICH INVOLVES NOT ONLY FORCE REDUCTIONS IN OVERMANNED 
RATINGS, BUT ALSO ENCOMPASSES THE ACCESSION OF PERSONNEL IN RATINGS 
EXPERIENCING A SHORTFALL DUE TO COMMUNITY DYNAMICS, AN INCREASE IN UNPLANNED 
LOSSES, OR CHANGES IN THE FLEET'S DEMAND SIGNAL FOR CERTAIN SKILLS.
