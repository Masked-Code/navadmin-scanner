SUBJ/2006 NAVAL OPERATIONS CONCEPT (NOC)//
REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/01SEP2002//
AMPN/REF A IS 2002 NAVAL OPERATING CONCEPT FOR JOINT OPERATIONS.//
RMKS/1.  THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS (CNO) AND COMMANDANT OF THE
MARINE CORPS (CMC) SIGNED THE 2006 NAVAL OPERATIONS CONCEPT (NOC) ON
01 SEP 06.  IT IS THEIR "COMMANDER'S INTENT" AND DESIGNED TO GUIDE
THE CREATIVITY AND JUDGMENT OF SAILORS AND MARINES IN APPLYING THE
PRINCIPLES AND METHODS ARTICULATED IN SEA POWER 21 AND THE 21ST
CENTURY MARINE CORPS.
2.  THIS ITERATION OF THE NOC SUPERCEDES THE 2002 NAVAL OPERATING
CONCEPT FOR JOINT OPERATIONS (REF A).  IT IS PRINCIPALLY GUIDED BY
THE NATIONAL STRATEGY ARTICULATED IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY
(NSS), THE NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY (NDS), AND THE NATIONAL
STRATEGY FOR MARITIME SECURITY (NSMS).  BY CITING EXAMPLES OF RECENT
OPERATIONS IN THE "NAVAL MISSIONS" SECTION AND PROVIDING VIGNETTES
OF FUTURE NAVAL, JOINT, AND INTER-AGENCY OPERATIONS, THE NOC PAINTS
A CLEAR PICTURE OF HOW THE NAVY-MARINE CORPS TEAM IS CONTRIBUTING,
AND WILL CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE, TO THE DEFENSE OF OUR NATION.
3.  IN THE PREFACE, BOTH CNO AND CMC EMPHASIZE:
A.  "THE CHANGING OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES THAT WE ELIMINATE
REDUNDANCIES AND FORGE GREATER INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN US.  THE
OVERARCHING GOAL IS GREATER AND MORE EFFICIENT ALIGNMENT BEGINNING
AT THE SERVICE HEADQUARTERS LEVEL.  WE CHARGE ALL HANDS TO CONDUCT
EXPERIMENTATION, WARGAMING, SEMINARS, AND DEBATE IN ORDER TO MORE
FULLY UNDERSTAND AND IMPLEMENT THE GUIDANCE PRESENTED HEREIN.  WE
EXPECT THAT THIS INTELLECTUAL RENAISSANCE WITHIN THE NAVAL SERVICE
WILL ENABLE US TO MEET THE SECURITY CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURY
AND REINFORCE THE PREEMINENCE OF U.S. NAVAL FORCES TO HELP DEFEND
THE HOMELAND AND WIN THE NATION S WARS."
B.  "IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE JOINT,
INTER-AGENCY, AND COALITION ENVIRONMENT, WE MUST ALWAYS:
(1) LOOK FIRST TO ONE ANOTHER TO FULLY LEVERAGE OUR STRONG HISTORIC
INTERDEPENDENCE.
(2) CONDUCT ASSESSMENT AND CONSULTATION BEFORE TAKING UNILATERAL
ACTION THAT MAY AFFECT ONE ANOTHER.
(3) RECOGNIZE THAT OPEN DISCUSSION AND DEBATE IS ACCEPTABLE
PROVIDED WE HAVE A COMMON GOAL IN MIND."
4.  COMMANDERS AND COMMANDING OFFICERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO DISCUSS THE
NOC AND ITS INTENT WITH ALL HANDS.  THE NOC CAN BE DOWNLOADED AT
NAVY KNOWLEDGE ONLINE (NKO) UNDER THE "LEADERSHIP INFORMATION"
PORTION OF THE "LEADERSHIP" SECTION OR AT HTTP:/WWW.MCWL.USMC.MIL/.
