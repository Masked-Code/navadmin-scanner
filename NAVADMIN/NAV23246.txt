3.  Eligible officers may only communicate with a promotion selection board 
via the Letter to the Board (LTB) process. Reference (a) announced the 
application known as Electronic Submission of Selection Board Documents 
(ESSBD), accessible through MyNavy Portal (MNP).  ESSBD improves the speed, 
transparency, and confidence of receipt over other LTB submission methods, 
such as hard copy and e-mail submitted letters and related attachments, and 
as such is the preferred submission vehicle. 
    a.  ESSBD will be available for all promotion, advancement and selection 
boards. 
    b.  ESSBD allows board candidates to electronically submit LTBs in a 
standard, consistent format, with or without attachments, and will allow the 
candidate to see (for content and clarity) exactly what will be delivered and 
presented to the board. 
    c.  To use ESSBD, candidates must access document services through MNP 
at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record.  On-screen instructions will 
direct follow on actions as necessary. 
    d.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted.  If required, a full visual user 
guide is available at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-
promotion. 
    e.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command not later than 2359 
(central time) 10 days prior to the convening date of the respective 
board.  Submitters are cautioned not to wait until the deadline date to 
submit LTBs via ESSBD or other available avenues.

    f.  If sending a board package from a non-NMCI network 
(bumed.mil, eu.navy.mil, etc.), please review procedures provided in 
NAVADMIN 220/19. 
    g.  Written communication submitted to the board may call attention to 
any matter concerning the officer record that the officer considers 
important.  Written communication may include, as enclosures, correspondence 
from any individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not 
originated by the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of 
the eligible officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must 
contain a written acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she 
desires such correspondence be presented to the board. 
Correspondence without such an acknowledgement is considered third-party 
correspondence and will be returned without being presented to the 
board.  Classified correspondence will not be accepted. 
    h.  All officers are reminded it is their responsibility to ensure their 
personnel records are substantially accurate and complete. 
 
4.  Merit reorder will not be authorized for the subject boards.
