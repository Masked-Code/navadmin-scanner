SUBJ/ACADEMIC YEAR 2023-2024 NAVAL WAR COLLEGE FLEET SEMINAR PROGRAM// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the U.S. Naval War College (NWC) Fleet 
Seminar Program (FSP) which offers intermediate level Joint Professional 
Military Education (JPME-I) through a set of three courses: Strategy and 
War (S and W), Theater Security Decision Making (TSDM) and Joint Maritime 
Operations (JMO). Each course normally requires one academic year to 
complete, which runs from September through the following May. All three 
courses are not offered simultaneously at all locations. There is no 
tuition fee and course materials are provided on a loan basis at no cost 
to the students. Applicants must apply by 31 May 2023. 
 
2.  Background:

Staff diploma, as well as credit for JPME-I. The FSP also provides a path to

Graduate Degree Program (GDP). FSP students may apply for the GDP following 
successful completion of their first FSP course. The FSP at all locations are

assigned temporary additional duty at another location may attend class at 
the new location.
