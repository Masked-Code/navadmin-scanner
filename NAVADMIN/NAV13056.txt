SUBJ/FY-14 NAVY GRADUATE EDUCATION UPDATE//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE FY-14 ADVANCED EDUCATION QUOTA PLAN.

2.  THIS PLAN PROVIDES EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE WARFIGHTING AND 
SUPPORT CAPABILITIES CONSISTENT WITH DEFENSE AND NAVY STRATEGIC GUIDANCE.  
THIS PLAN PRIORITIZES PROGRAMS THAT DEVELOP EXPERTISE IN THE MIDDLE-EAST, ASIA 
PACIFIC REGIONS, CYBERSPACE, UNDERSEA WARFARE, AND ENERGY PLANS AND POLICY.  
IN ADDITION, THE PLAN PROVIDES THE FOUNDATION TO SUSTAIN OUR TECHNOLOGICAL 
ADVANTAGE AND DEVELOP THE SKILLS TO PLAN FOR AND OPERATE THE NAVY OF THE 
FUTURE WHILE ELIMINATING STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL ENERGY VULNERABILITIES.

3.  THE FY-14 PLAN PROVIDES OVER 1,550 FUNDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEGREE AND 
NON-DEGREE PROGRAMS ACROSS THE FULL SPECTRUM OF COMMUNITIES AND RANKS THAT 
INCLUDE 480 QUOTAS AT NAVAL POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL (NPS), 145 QUOTAS AT TOP 
CIVILIAN UNIVERSITIES, 220 QUOTAS AT THE NAVAL WAR COLLEGE, 225 QUOTAS AT 
JOINT AND OTHER SERVICE COLLEGES, AND 70 QUOTAS FOR FELLOWSHIP AND TRAINING 
WITH INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITIES.

4.  IN RESPONSE TO OUTCOMES FROM THE 2012 UNRESTRICTED LINE (URL) EDUCATION 
SUMMIT, WHICH REQUESTED SHORTER CURRICULA FOR URL OFFICERS, WE BEGAN TWO 
'MIXED-MODE' PILOT PROGRAMS AT NPS.  THE FIRST PROGRAM, APPLIED MANAGEMENT

RESIDENCE AT NPS.  THE SECOND PROGRAM, SYSTEMS ENGINEERING ANALYSIS (5600P),

MINIMAL INTERRUPTION IN TRADITIONAL CAREER PATHS.

5.  ENLISTED GRADUATE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES WILL CONTINUE TO BE OFFERED IN 
THE CYBER SYSTEMS OPERATION (CSO) PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS UP TO FIVE ENLISTED
