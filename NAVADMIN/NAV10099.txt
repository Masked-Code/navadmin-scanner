PROGRAM.
RMKS/1.  THIS MESSAGE APPLIES TO ALL NAVY PERSONNEL, UNIFORMED AND
CIVILIAN.  ECHELON II COMMANDERS AND ALL REGIONAL COMMANDERS SHALL
ENSURE WIDEST DISSEMINATION TO ALL SUBORDINATE AND TENANT COMMANDS
AND DETACHMENTS FOR ACTION AS REQUIRED.
2.  PER REF A:
    A.  WORSENING VIOLENCE AND INSECURITY IN NORTHERN MEXICO HAS
SEVERELY IMPACTED THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FABRIC IN TOWNS AND
CITIES LIKE CIUDAD JUAREZ, NUEVO LAREDO, MONTERRAY AND REYNOSA.
THE URBAN CENTERS HAVE BECOME BATTLEGROUNDS IN A NEW ROUND OF
CARTEL-ON-CARTEL VIOLENCE.  RECENT VIOLENT ATTACKS HAVE CAUSED THE
U.S. EMBASSY IN MEXICO TO URGE U.S. CITIZENS TO DELAY UNNECESSARY
TRAVEL TO PARTS OF DURANGO, COAHUILA AND CHIHUAHUA STATES AND TO
ADVISE U.S. CITIZENS RESIDING OR TRAVELING IN THOSE AREAS TO
EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION.  THE HIGH CRIME RATE AND ESCALATION OF
VIOLENCE BY THE DRUG CARTELS CONTINUES TO BE OF CONCERN; BOTH OF
WHICH MAY INDISCRIMINATELY THREATEN THE WELL-BEING OF DOD
TRAVELERS IN MEXICO.
    B.  USNORTHCOM HAS ISSUED A NEW TRAVEL DIRECTIVE FOR MEXICO
(REF A), SUPERCEDING AND RESCINDING PREVIOUSLY ISSUED ADVISORIES AND
AMPLIFYING PREVIOUSLY ISSUED GUIDANCE.  THE NEW DIRECTIVE APPLIES TO
ALL DOD PERSONNEL OVER WHICH COMMANDER USNORTHCOM HAS FORCE
PROTECTION RESPONSIBILITY IAW THE UNIFIED COMMAND PLAN (UCP) AND IS
VALID UNTIL 15 MAY 2010.
    C.  DIA WORLDWIDE THREAT LEVELS FOR MEXICO:  TERRORISM THREAT
ASSESSMENT- LOW, CRIME ASSESSMENT- HIGH.  FPCON BASELINE FOR MEXICO
REMAINS UNCHANGED AT BRAVO.  NO TRAVELER OR DEPLOYED UNIT FPCON
MEASURES HAVE BEEN DIRECTED.
    D.  TRAVEL DIRECTIVE:  DUE TO THE ONGOING VIOLENCE ALONG THE
U.S.-MEXICO BORDER AND THE RECENT KILLING OF THREE AMERICAN CITIZENS
 IN CIUDAD JUAREZ, ALL NON-OFFICIAL TRAVEL (LEAVE AND PASS) IS
PROHIBITED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE TO THE STATE OF CHIHUAHUA; STATE OF
 DURANGO; AND THE CITIES OF NOGALES, PIEDRAS NEGRAS, NUEVO LAREDO,
MONTERREY, AND MATAMORAS.  OFFICIAL DOD TRAVEL TO THESE AREAS IS
LIMITED TO MISSION ESSENTIAL TRAVEL ONLY.  GRANTING OF PERMISSION TO
 ALLOW SERVICE MEMBERS OR DOD EMPLOYEES TO RESIDE IN MEXICO REMAINS
AT THE DISCRETION OF THE SERVICE COMPONENTS.  EMERGENCY TRAVEL MAY
BE AUTHORIZED UPON APPROVAL OF COMMANDERS/DIRECTORS OR SERVICE
COMPONENTS, DEFENSE AGENCIES, AND DOD FIELD ACTIVITIES.
    E. TRAVEL ADVISORY:
        1)  COMMANDERS SHOULD CONTINUE TO REVIEW EXISTING POLICIES
REGARDING TRAVEL FOR BOTH OFFICIAL AND NON-OFFICIAL PURPOSES TO ALL
OTHER AREAS OF MEXICO AND CONSIDER IMPOSING LIMITATIONS ON TRAVEL TO
MEXICO UNTIL THE SECURITY SITUATION IMPROVES.
        2)  OFFICIAL TRAVEL TO AREAS OTHER THAN SPECIFIED ABOVE:
COMMANDERS SHOULD IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE OFFICIAL TRAVELERS
REVIEW CURRENT TRAVEL ALERT AND FOREIGN CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS,
ENSURE CONTACT PLANS ARE DEVELOPED AND REHEARSED WITH IN-COUNTRY
HOSTS, COORDINATE FOR AN IN-COUNTRY THREAT BRIEF AND PERIODIC THREAT
 UPDATES, AND REVIEW IN-COUNTRY FP ACTIONS SHOULD THE THREAT
ENVIRONMENT AND FP CONDITIONS CHANGE.
        3)  NON-OFFICIAL TRAVEL TO AREAS OTHER THAN SPECIFIED ABOVE:
 DOD MEMBERS TRAVELING FOR PERSONAL ACTIVITIES AND WITH NO OFFICIAL
IN-COUNTRY HOSTS CONTINUE TO BE A CONCERN DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR
BEING VICTIMS OF INDISCRIMINATE OR TARGETED ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND
CRIME.  WHILE THIS CONCERN SHOULD NOT BE THE SOLE REASON TO INVOKE
TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, IT SHOULD PROMPT ACTIONS TO CONTINUE
IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ENSURING PERSONNEL
UNDERSTAND THE RISK AND ARE BEST PREPARED FOR TRAVEL.  IMPOSITION OF
 TRAVEL LIMITATIONS (I.E., CURFEWS, BUDDY RULES, AND BOUNDARIES)
SHOULD BE REVIEWED FOR IMPLEMENTATION, IF NOT ALREADY DONE SO.
RECOMMEND THE CONTINUANCE OF FORMAL PROCEDURES TO APPROVE/DENY
TRAVEL, PROVIDE PRE-TRAVEL BRIEFS, PREPARE INDIVIDUAL AT PLANS, AND
REQUIRE CHECK-IN/OUT CONTACT.
        4)  DOD CIVILIANS AND FAMILY MEMBERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO
FOLLOW COMPONENT, DOD, AND USNORTHCOM AT GUIDANCE AND PROCEDURES
FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY AND SECURITY.
    F.  USNORTHCOM HAS DIRECTED ITS SERVICE COMPONENTS, DEFENSE
AGENCIES AND DOD FIELD ACTIVITIES TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TO
ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY OF ALL PERSONNEL LIVING IN OR TRAVELING TO MEXICO.
4.  THE FOLLOWING GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF INTEREST (GAOI) HAS BEEN
