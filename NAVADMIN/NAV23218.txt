programs application, OPNAV 1420/1.  Specific requirements for CO endorsement 
can be found in reference (a). 
 
5.  All applicants must login to MyNavy Portal (MNP) to complete the 
electronic personnel action request (NAVPERS 1306/7) requesting release from

8.  In line with reference (a), applicants must meet the prescribed 
qualifications in line with this program and the Reserve program 
authorization (PA), or community requirements of the designator for which 
they are applying, with the exception of surface warfare (1117) who align 
with PA 100.  Regardless of the selected designator, all applicants must 
submit three interviewer appraisals with the OPNAV 1420/1 application.   
Interviewer appraisals should be conducted by at least one officer in the 
designator(s) for which the Sailor is applying.  Specific rank requirements 
for interviews are outlined on the TAR ISPP website (see paragraph 3).
