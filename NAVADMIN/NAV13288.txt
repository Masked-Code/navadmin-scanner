E-MAILED LTBS MUST BE ENCRYPTED TO PROTECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE

JUSTIFY A LATE LTB.  IF THE CANDIDATE IS UNABLE TO SEND THE E-MAIL ENCRYPTED

EXCHANGE (SAFE) WEBSITE AT HTTPS://SAFE.AMRDEC.ARMY.MIL/SAFE/ TO TRANSMIT 
THEIR LTB TO CSCSELBOARD(AT)NAVY.MIL.  IN ORDER FOR LTBS TO BE CONSIDERED BY 
THE BOARD, THE NPC CSC MUST RECEIVE THE E-MAIL NOTIFICATION OF THE FILE 
UPLOAD FROM SAFE BEFORE THE DEADLINE.  THERE MAY BE A DELAY FOR THE SAFE WEB 
SITE TO NOTIFY NPC CSC OF FILE UPLOAD.  THEREFORE, IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
THAT CANDIDATES SUBMIT THEIR LTBS EARLY.
    E.  USE OF SPECIAL HANDLING MAIL (CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED) IS NOT ADVISED 
DUE TO SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN HANDLING.
    F.  SAILORS ARE WELCOME TO PROVIDE NEW INFORMATION TO THE BOARD THAT IS 
NOT CURRENTLY IN THEIR OMPF.  CANDIDATES ARE AUTHORIZED TO SUBMIT MORE THAN 
ONE LTB, VICE WAITING UNTIL THE DEADLINE TO SUBMIT ONE ALL-INCLUSIVE LTB.   
ALTHOUGH MULTIPLE LTBS ARE AUTHORIZED, CANDIDATES SHOULD NOT DUPLICATE 
PREVIOUS LTB INFORMATION.  EARLY SUBMISSION OF LTB IS RECOMMENDED.  LTBS, 
WHICH MAY BE MAILED OR E-MAILED TO THE ADDRESSES IN PARAGRAPH 12.D. ABOVE, 
PROVIDE CANDIDATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT ANY MISSING DOCUMENTS FROM THE 
SECTIONS OF THEIR OMPF THAT ARE REVIEWED BY THE BOARD.  THE E7 SELECTION 
BOARD WILL REVIEW THE OMPF AND PERFORMANCE SUMMARY RECORD PARTS I, II, AND 
III OF ALL CANDIDATES, AS WELL AS ITEMS SUBMITTED BY CANDIDATES PER POLICY 
OUTLINED IN THIS NAVADMIN.  ANY MISSING ITEMS FROM THE CANDIDATE'S OMPF 
SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN THE CANDIDATE'S LTB. CANDIDATES ARE ENCOURAGED TO 
REVIEW REF (A), CHAPTER 12, AND REF (G) CONCERNING SELECTION BOARD RECORD 
REVIEW, SELECTION BOARD CORRESPONDENCE SUBMISSION, AND OMPF CORRECTIONS.  
BOARD ELIGIBLES SHOULD REVIEW THEIR OMPF VIA THE "OMPF MY RECORD" OPTION ON 
BOL OR BY ORDERING A CD-ROM OF THEIR COMPLETE OMPF RECORD EITHER VIA BOL OR 
PER REF (H).  IN MANY CASES, UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION VIEWABLE IN NSIPS 
ELECTRONIC SERVICE RECORD MAY NOT BE CONTAINED IN A CANDIDATE'S OMPF.
THEREFORE, IF DOCUMENTS THAT CANDIDATES WANT THE BOARD TO REVIEW ARE NOT 
VIEWABLE OR HAVE BEEN VERIFIED AS MISSING VIA "OMPF MY RECORD", THEY MUST 
SUBMIT THOSE DOCUMENTS, ALONG WITH A COVER LETTER TO THE SELECTION BOARD 
PRESIDENT, TO BE REVIEWED BY THIS BOARD.  LTBS FORWARDED FOR CONSIDERATION BY 
THE E7 SELECTION BOARD WILL NOT BE QQQQ ADDED TO THE MEMBER'S OMPF, EXCEPT 
FOR AWARD CITATIONS ACCURATELY REFLECTED IN NAVY DEPARTMENT AWARDS WEB 
SERVICES, PER REF (I).
