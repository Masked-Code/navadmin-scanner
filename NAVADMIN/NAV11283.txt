SUBJ/CNO MESSAGE TO THE FLEET//

RMKS/1.  TODAY, I AM HONORED TO BECOME YOUR 30TH CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.  
ADMIRAL ROUGHEAD TURNED OVER TO ME THE GREATEST NAVY IN THE WORLD.

2.  I AM THE SON OF A STEEL WORKER FROM BUTLER, PA.  GROWING UP WITH FOUR 
SISTERS AND MY BROTHER, MY PARENTS TAUGHT ME AT AN EARLY AGE THE VALUE OF HARD 
WORK, PERSEVERANCE, AND INTEGRITY.  THE OPPORTUNITIES THE NAVY GAVE ME OVER 
THESE PAST 36 YEARS PUT ME ON A JOURNEY FROM WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA TO SERVING 
AS CHIEF OF NAVAL  OPERATIONS TODAY.  I CONSIDER MYSELF AN EXAMPLE OF THE 
TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES OUR NAVY AFFORDS EACH OF US EVERY DAY.

3.  MY THREE TENETS TO ADDRESS OUR CHALLENGES AND ORGANIZE, TRAIN, AND EQUIP 
THE NAVY, ARE PROVIDED HERE:
    A.  WARFIGHTING FIRST:  WARFIGHTING IS AT THE CORE OF OUR EXISTENCE.  WE 
MUST MAINTAIN OUR ABILITY TO FIGHT AND WIN.
    B.  OPERATE FORWARD:  WE ARE MOST EFFECTIVE OPERATING FORWARD AROUND THE 
WORLD, ENSURING ACCESS TO THE MARITIME CROSSROADS TO  ENSURE FREEDOM OF 
MANEUVER AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY.
    C.  BE READY:  WE WILL BE READY.  OUR SAILORS WILL BE TRAINED, OUR 
SUBMARINES, SHIPS, AND AIRCRAFT WILL BE MAINTAINED, AND OUR  SHORE COMMANDS 
WILL BE ENABLED TO SUPPORT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO YOUR  JOB.  WE WILL BE 
JUDICIOUS WITH OUR RESOURCES, AND OUR SAILORS' AND CIVILIANS' TIME, WHILE 
PREPARING TO EXECUTE ASSIGNED MISSIONS.

4.  I AM HONORED TO BE YOUR CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.  DRAWING UPON OVER TWO 
CENTURIES OF HERITAGE AND TRADITION, I TRUST THAT, WHEN  CALLED UPON, YOU WILL 
PERFORM SUPERBLY.  YOU EXEMPLIFY THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF SERVICE TO OUR 
NATION.

5.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL GREENERT, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
