SUBJ/FY-11 AVIATION CAREER CONTINUATION PAY//

RMKS/1.  A VITAL PART OF DEVELOPING A TOTAL FORCE STRATEGY AND MAINTAINING 
COMBAT READINESS IS TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE INCENTIVES TO RETAIN SKILLED 
AVIATION PERSONNEL FOR CRITICAL NAVAL AVIATION ENTERPRISE BILLETS.  THE 
AVIATION CAREER CONTINUATION PAY (ACCP) PROGRAM PROVIDES SELECTED BONUSES AS 
AN INCENTIVE TO RETAIN SUFFICIENT ELIGIBLE PILOTS AND NAVAL FLIGHT OFFICERS 
THROUGH DEPARTMENT HEAD AND COMMAND MILESTONES.  DUE TO INCREASED RETENTION 
AMONG CONTROL GRADE AVIATION OFFICERS AND SUFFICIENT TAKE RATES IN MANY 
COMMUNITIES BY DEPARTMENT HEAD ELIGIBLE OFFICERS, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FROM THE 
FY-10 PROGRAM HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE FY-11 ACCP PROGRAM.

2.  A BRIEF BREAKDOWN OF THE CHANGES TO THE FY-11 ACCP PROGRAM ARE AS FOLLOWS:
    A.  DEPARTMENT HEAD (DH): THE DH BONUS IS A 5-YEAR CONTRACT BASED ON 
DESIGNATOR AND AVIATION COMMUNITY AND WILL NO LONGER OFFER A LUMP-SUM OPTION.  
ADDITIONALLY, THE PAYMENT SCHEDULE HAS BEEN ADJUSTED AND OFFICERS WILL RECEIVE 
A REDUCED AMOUNT UNTIL DH SCREENED.  THE FY-11 PROGRAM CONTINUES TO AUTHORIZE 
THE PAYMENT OF FIVE-YEAR CONTRACTS ONE YEAR PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE 
ACTIVE DUTY MINIMUM SERVICE REQUIREMENT (MSR).  LONG-TERM APPLICANTS ARE 
ELIGIBLE IF THEIR MSR EXPIRES IN FY-11 OR FY-12.  PAYMENT WILL BEGIN WHEN THE 
OFFICER IS WITHIN ONE YEAR OF COMPLETION OF THE MSR.  BONUS AMOUNTS ARE AS 
FOLLOWS:
HM - PILOT ($10,000/YR)
HSC - PILOT ($10,000/YR)
HSL/HSM - PILOT ($10,000/YR)
VAQ - PILOT ($15,000/YR); NFO ($20,000/YR) VAW/VRC - PILOT ($5,000/YR); NFO

($10,000/YR); NFO ($10,000/YR)
VQ(P) - PILOT ($10,000/YR); NFO ($10,000/YR)
VQ(T) - PILOT ($5,000/YR); NFO ($5,000/YR)
    B.  AT-SEA BONUS: THE AT-SEA BONUS IS A 2-YEAR CONTRACT UPON ARRIVAL TO A 
DESIGNATED CRITICAL AT SEA BILLET FOR AVIATORS NOT ALREADY UNDER AN ACCP 
CONTRACT.  THE BONUS IS PAID IN EQUAL ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS OF $5,000 PER YEAR.
    C.  COMMAND BONUS: THE COMMAND BONUS IS A 3-YEAR CONTRACT UPON ARRIVAL AS 
XO/CO FOR AT-SEA OPERATIONAL OR OPERATIONAL TRAINING SQUADRONS ONLY.  LEVELS 
REMAIN UNCHANGED FOR FY-11 AND IT IS PAID IN EQUAL ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS OF 
$12,000 PER YEAR.
    D.  ASTRONAUT BONUS: THE ASTRONAUT BONUS IS A 3-YEAR CONTRACT UPON 
RECEIVING DESIGNATION AS ASTRONAUT OR ASTRONAUT CANDIDATE AND TRAINING WITH 
NASA AS A PRIMARY OR BACKUP FLIGHT CREW MEMBER. IT IS PAID IN EQUAL ANNUAL
