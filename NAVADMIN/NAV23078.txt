the promotion and not be tendered the promoting appointment.  The delay 
authority will immediately forward the notification of delay with supporting 
documentation to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-83), copy to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806).

promoting are mentally, physically, morally and professionally qualified in 
accordance with section 14311 of title 10, U.S. Code.   Per reference (a), 
officers are ineligible for promotion if they have failed the most recent 
Physical Fitness Assessment.  COs shall verify the promoting officer's 
information in the Physical Readiness Information Management System to ensure 
compliance with reference (a), as modified by reference (b), and delay the 
officers promotion in accordance with paragraph 3 of this NAVADMIN, if 
required.
