RMKS/1. THIS SETS FORTH THE 2012 CALENDAR FOR AMERICA 
(CFA12), DETAILING THE NAVY'S LARGE-SCALE OUTREACH EVENTS FOR 
THE COMING YEAR. EVENTS INCLUDE NAVY WEEKS, FLEET WEEKS, 
DIVERSITY EVENTS, WAR OF 1812 BICENTENNIAL COMMEMORATIVE EVENTS, 
BLUE ANGEL AIR SHOWS, SHIP COMMISSIONING CEREMONIES AND KEY 
RECRUITING EVOLUTIONS AMONG OTHERS.

2. PER REF A AND AS DISCUSSED REF B, RESEARCH AND ASSESSMENT 
CONDUCTED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS SHOWN THAT WHILE AMERICANS 
LIKE AND APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR NAVY, THEY DO NOT 
TRULY UNDERSTAND THE NAVY'S MISSION AND ITS IMPORTANCE. NAVY 
OUTREACH EFFORTS MUST BE STRUCTURED AND EXECUTED TO EDUCATE THE 
AMERICAN PUBLIC ON THE NAVY'S CAPABILITIES AND RELEVANCE TO 
NATIONAL SECURITY.  THE PRIMARY GOAL OF NAVY OUTREACH IS TO GAIN 
AMERICANS' UNDERSTANDING THAT THE NAVY IS A WARFIGHTING FORCE, 
OPERATING FORWARD, READY TO FIGHT AND WIN TODAY AND EVERY DAY.  
ACHIEVING THIS GOAL IS A PARTICULAR AND UNIQUE CHALLENGE. THE 
NAVY'S MEN AND WOMEN MAKE UP ONLY A FRACTION OF ONE PERCENT OF 
THE TOTAL U.S. POPULATION. INDIVIDUAL CONNECTIONS, WHICH CAN BE 
THE MOST POWERFUL AND INFLUENTIAL ONES, ARE NOT AS PERVASIVE 
TODAY AS IN THE PAST. BECAUSE NAVAL FORCES AND PERSONNEL ARE 
BASED PRIMARILY ON BOTH COASTS, THE NAVY IS CHALLENGED TO 
COMMUNICATE ITS MISSION AWAY FROM FLEET CONCENTRATION AREAS. IN 
2012, THE BICENTENNIAL OF THE WAR OF 1812 PROVIDES A POWERFUL 
PLATFORM FROM WHICH TO LAUNCH AN INFORMATIVE OUTREACH CAMPAIGN. 

3. TO FURTHER HELP GAIN AMERICANS' UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR NAVY, 
PARTICULARLY INTO AREAS OF THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT 
NAVY PRESENCE, THE NAVY WILL IMPLEMENT A NEW PROGRAM IN 2012 THAT 
WILL MATCH 50 SENIOR OFFICER, CIVILIAN AND ENLISTED LEADERS WITH 
50 CITIES ACROSS AMERICA. THE "NAVY 50-50" PROGRAM WILL SEND NAVY 
LEADERS TO THEIR ASSIGNED CITY FOR 2-3 DAYS OF HIGH-LEVEL 
ENGAGEMENTS WITH CORPORATE EXECUTIVES, CIVIC LEADERS, GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS, UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS, NON-PROFIT EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
AND SENIOR EDITORS AND JOURNALISTS FROM THE MEDIA. MORE INFORMATION 
ON THIS NEW INITIATIVE WILL BE FORTHCOMING SEPCOR.  

4. SIMPLE AND CONSISTENT MESSAGING IS ESSENTIAL TO HELP THE 
AMERICAN PUBLIC UNDERSTAND THEIR NAVY. KEY NAVY MESSAGES WILL BE 
PROVIDED SEPCOR.
