RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces Detailing Marketplace Assignment Policy 
(DMAP) Phase IV and applies exclusively to Damage Controlman (DC) and 
Aviation Boatswain's Mate - Launching and Recovery Equipment (ABE) Sailors in 
the Active Component (AC).  As a modification to references (a) through (e), 
all advancements to E-5 and E-6 for DC and ABE Sailors in the AC will be 
conducted via Advance to Position (A2P) and Command Advance to Position 
(CA2P) beginning 1 June 2024. 
 
2.  The requirements and process of DMAP outlined in references (a) through 
(e) remain in place.  First sea tours for DC and ABE Sailors in the AC remain 
in a four plus three construct.  Detailing Marketplace Incentive Pay (DMIP) 
remains only for Sailors that re-tour at sea via the four plus three 
construct. 
 
3.  DMAP Phase IV makes the following policy changes for DC and ABE Sailors 
in the AC: 
    a.  Beginning with the March 2024 exam, the Navy-wide Advancement Exam 
(NWAE) for advancement to E-5 and E-6 will transition to a Rating Knowledge 
Exam (RKE).  The RKE will be completely consistent with the NWAE as to type 
and scope of questions and will be conducted using the same processes and 
timeline as the NWAE.  However, Sailors are only required to pass the RKE 
once per paygrade and all Time-in-Rate (TIR) requirements to take the exam 
are removed at the E-4 and E-5 paygrades. 
Successfully passing the RKE is a requirement for Sailors to compete for 
assignment to billets in the next higher paygrade via A2P and 
CA2P.  Education Service Officers must create Enlisted Advancement Worksheets 
and submit exam orders for these Sailors.  To support Cycle 263 exam ordering 
timelines, exams for these Sailors have been added to Cycle 263 mass/initial 
TIR orders and must be retained until completion of the Spring exam cycle. 
Note:  DC and ABE Sailors advanced to E-4 and E-5 in Cycle 260 are now 
eligible for the Cycle 263 RKE. 
    b.  Although not required to do so, Sailors who pass the RKE may 
voluntarily take future RKEs in an effort to improve their marketplace score 
as measured by the Sailor Scoring Criteria (SSC) in order to become more 
competitive in the marketplace through a higher exam score. 
    c.  Once they pass the RKE, Sailors may advance to E-5 and E-6 by one of 
two processes: 
       (1)  A2P: Sailors compete in the MyNavy Assignment (MNA) marketplace 
for a billet at the next higher rank on the normal timeline relative to their 
Projected Rotation Date (PRD) as specified in their Permanent Change of 
Station (PCS) orders or as adjusted by higher authority or approved personnel 
action request. 
Multiple Sailors competing for the same billet will be adjudicated by 
Enlisted Distribution Division (PERS-40) via comparison of transparent SSC 
and relevant platform experience.  Once matched to a billet at the next 
higher rank, the Sailor must obligate service to complete the full tour at 
the new rank in the new billet via extension or reenlistment, as necessary, 
and may be frocked 30 days prior to transfer.  Sailors will be advanced by 
the gaining command upon arrival in the new billet and after completion of 
any required training. 
       (2)  CA2P:  A Commanding Officer (CO) selects a Sailor in their 
command who has completed at least half of their tour (24 months as an E-4, 
18 months as an E-5) to advance into a vacant or projected-to-be vacant 
billet as validated by PERS-40 via a Manning Realignment Request 
(MRR).  Additionally, with DMAP Phase IV, Immediate Superiors In Command 
(ISIC) and Type Commanders (TYCOM) can also conduct CA2P from one assigned 
unit to another upon nomination by a Sailor's CO.  This new ISIC/TYCOM 
process will also require completion of at least half the tour prior to 
transfer and a vacant or projected-to-be vacant billet as validated by PERS-
40. 
Additionally, it cannot result in a funded PCS move.  An approved CA2P Sailor 
must obligate service to complete a full tour at the new rank beyond the PRD 
at the old rank via extension or reenlistment, as necessary, and may be 
frocked upon PERS-40 approval of the MRR. 
The Sailor will be advanced by the gaining command upon arrival in the new 
billet and after completion of any required training. 
    d.  E-4 and E-5 Sailors who have passed the RKE and will meet all of the 
following criteria by the time they desire to enter the marketplace may 
request early entry into the marketplace from PERS-40 via Electronic 
Personnel Action Request (NAVPERS 1306/7): 
       (1) More than 1 year at their current command 
       (2) More than 3 years at their current rank 
       (3) More than 1 year until their PRD 
    e.  Advancement via the Meritorious Advancement Program is no longer 
authorized for advancements to E-5 and E-6 for DC and ABE Sailors in the AC. 
 
4.  This policy commences with the March 2024 (Cycle 263) examination cycle 
and the first Marketplace will open for these Sailors with the June MNA 
cycle. 
 
5.  Points of Contact 
    a.  For specific rate/rating/Navy enlisted classification questions and 
concerns, Sailors should contact their respective community manager or 
detailer. 
    b.  For general career information, including questions about DMAP, 
contact MyNavy Career Center contact center at 833-330-MNCC (6622) or 
askmncc@navy.mil. 
 
6.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
