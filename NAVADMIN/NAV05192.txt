SUBJ/NATIONAL CALL TO SERVICE UPDATE//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THE INITIAL SUCCESS OF THE NATIONAL CALL TO
SERVICE (NCS) PROGRAM HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING.  WITH THE FIRST GROUP
OF NCS SAILORS NEARING THE COMPLETION OF THEIR ACTIVE DUTY
OBLIGATIONS, ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE THESE SAILORS
ENJOY A SMOOTH TRANSITION TO CONTINUE THEIR SERVICE EITHER ON ACTIVE
DUTY OR AS A MEMBER OF THE NAVY RESERVE.  THIS MESSAGE DIRECTS
REVISED PROCEDURES FOR THE NCS PROGRAM AND ISSUES AN INTERIM CHANGE
TO MILPERSMAN 1133-080.  SPECIFIC TOPICS COVERED INCLUDE:
     - DEFINITION
     - EAOS VERIFICATION AND CORRECTIONS
     - DRILLING RESERVE OBLIGATION
     - PERFORM TO SERVE CONSIDERATIONS
     - PROCEDURES TO REMAIN ON ACTIVE DUTY
     - ADVANCEMENT CONSIDERATIONS
     - BONUS PAYMENT PROCEDURES
     - DETAILING ISSUES
     - POINTS OF CONTACT
2.  DEFINITION.  NCS IS A CONGRESSIONALLY INITIATED SHORT-TERM
ENLISTMENT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO PROMOTE AND FACILITATE MILITARY
ENLISTMENT IN SUPPORT OF NATIONAL SERVICE.  NCS PARTICIPANTS ARE
NON-PRIOR SERVICE MEMBERS WHO OBLIGATE FOR 15 MONTHS ACTIVE DUTY
FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF ALL INITIAL TRAINING (TO INCLUDE BOOT CAMP,
APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING, OR "A" AND/OR "C" SCHOOL).  SAILORS IN THIS
PROGRAM SUPPORT NEAR-TERM ACTIVE DUTY MANNING REQUIREMENTS AND
FUTURE DRILLING RESERVE (DRILRES) MANNING SHORTFALLS.
3.  EAOS VERIFICATION AND CORRECTIONS.  THE ENLISTED MASTER FILE
REFLECTS THAT MANY NCS PERSONNEL IN THE FLEET DO NOT HAVE THE
REQUIRED 15-MONTH RESERVE ACTIVE DUTY OBLIGATION (RADO) EXTENSION
REFLECTED IN THEIR RECORDS.  THIS 15-MONTH OBLIGATION FOLLOWING THE
FINAL SCHOOL IN THE PARTICIPANT'S PIPELINE ("A" AND/OR "C" SCHOOL)
IS A REQUIREMENT FOR THE NCS PROGRAM.  VERIFICATION IS PARAMOUNT TO
ENSURE THESE PERSONNEL FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATION TO THE NCS PROGRAM.
NCS PERSONNEL ARE IDENTIFIED ON THE ACTIVITY'S ENLISTED DISTRIBUTION
AND VERIFICATION REPORT AS BRANCH/CLASS '32', SPECIAL PROGRAM
INDICATOR 'Q', AND HAVE AN EXPIRATION OF RESERVE ENLISTMENT.
    A.  SERVICE SCHOOL COMMANDS SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE TRANSFERRING
NATIONAL CALL TO SERVICE PARTICIPANT HAS A 15-MONTH RADO REMAINING
ON THIS PERIOD OF ACTIVE DUTY FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF FORMAL
TRAINING.  IF NECESSARY, SUBMIT AN ACTIVE DUTY EXTENSION TO COVER
THE REQUIRED 15 MONTH PERIOD.
    B.  COMMANDS WHO GAIN A NATIONAL CALL TO SERVICE PARTICIPANT
FROM AN "A" OR "C" SCHOOL SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE MEMBER HAS THE
REQUIRED 15-MONTH RADO APPLIED.  IF NECESSARY, SUBMIT AN ACTIVE DUTY
EXTENSION TO COVER THE REQUIRED 15-MONTH PERIOD.
4.  DRILRES OBLIGATION.  NCS PARTICIPANTS INCUR A MANDATORY 24-MONTH
DRILLING RESERVE OBLIGATION IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THEIR INITIAL
ACTIVE DUTY PERIOD.  IT IS STRONGLY DESIRED THAT RESERVE AFFILIATION
PAPERWORK BE COMPLETED PRIOR TO THE MEMBER BEING RELEASED FROM
ACTIVE DUTY.  AFFILIATION PAPERWORK MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE LOCAL
RESERVE ACTIVITY RECRUITER.  A LIST OF RESERVE ACTIVITIES WITH
TOLL FREE NUMBERS ARE LOCATED ON THE NAVY RESERVE WEBSITE
WWW.RESERVES.NAVY.MIL UNDER TOLL FREE PHONE DIRECTORY.
INDIVIDUALS MUST REPORT TO THE RESERVE ACTIVITY RECRUITER NO LATER
THAN 14 BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING RELEASE FROM ACTIVE DUTY.
5.  PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) CONSIDERATIONS.  DUE TO THEIR ABBREVIATED
INITIAL PERIOD OF ACTIVE DUTY, NCS PERSONNEL WILL BE ENTERING THE
PTS WINDOW SHORTLY AFTER REPORTING TO THEIR ULTIMATE DUTY STATION.
IT IS NOT PRACTICAL FOR THESE MEMBERS TO RECEIVE A PROPER REVIEW
THROUGH THE PTS PROGRAM, THEREFORE, NCS PERSONNEL WILL NOT FALL
UNDER THE PTS PROCESS FOLLOWING THEIR INITIAL ACTIVE DUTY PERIOD BUT
MAY REQUEST TO REMAIN ON ACTIVE DUTY USING PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN
PARA 6 BELOW.
6.  PROCEDURES TO REMAIN ON ACTIVE DUTY.  WHILE PROCEDURES ARE IN
PLACE FOR NCS SAILORS TO REQUEST TO REMAIN ON ACTIVE DUTY, THE
ULTIMATE INTENT OF THE NCS PROGRAM IS TO FILL CRITICAL VACANCIES
WHICH EXIST IN THE NAVAL RESERVE.  THEREFORE, REQUESTS TO REMAIN ON
ACTIVE DUTY BEYOND THE INITIAL ACTIVE DUTY PERIOD WILL BE CONSIDERED
ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.
    A.  NCS PERSONNEL ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO REENLIST FOLLOWING
COMPLETION OF THEIR INITIAL ACTIVE DUTY PERIOD.
    B.  THOSE NCS PERSONNEL WHO DESIRE TO REMAIN ON ACTIVE DUTY MAY
REQUEST TO EXTEND THEIR RADO FOR A PERIOD OF 24 MONTHS ONLY.
REQUEST MUST BE SUBMITTED AT LEAST 10 MONTHS PRIOR TO MEMBER S EAOS.
FOR THOSE NCS SAILORS CURRENTLY WITHIN THE 10 MONTH WINDOW,
REQUESTS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  SUBMIT REQUESTS
FOR EXTENSIONS OF ACTIVE DUTY TO COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4812).
REQUESTS SHOULD INCLUDE, AS A MINIMUM:  NAVPERS 1306/7 SIGNED BY CO
(MAY NOT BE BY DIRECTION), MINIMUM OF ONE "OBSERVED" EVALUATION
(SPECIAL MAY BE NECESSARY), AND A LETTER ENDORSEMENT FROM A SENIOR
RATING SPECIALIST TO DOCUMENT MEMBER S POTENTIAL TO CONTINUE ON
ACTIVE DUTY IN THAT RATING.  IF NCS MEMBER IS NOT SERVING WITH A
SENIOR RATING SPECIALIST, ENDORSEMENT MAY BE SUBMITTED BY SUPERVISOR
DOCUMENTING MEMBER S POTENTIAL.
    C.  IF NCS MEMBERS DESIRE TO REMAIN ON ACTIVE DUTY FOLLOWING
THEIR 24 MONTH EXTENSION, THEY WILL BE REQUIRED TO REQUEST TO
REENLIST VIA THE PTS PROCESS.
7.  ADVANCEMENT CONSIDERATIONS.  NCS PARTICIPANTS WILL PARTICIPATE
IN THE ACTIVE DUTY EXAMINATION CYCLES AND WILL COMPETE AGAINST THE
ACTIVE COMPONENT DURING THEIR TERM OF ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE.  NCS
PARTICIPANTS MAY NOT BE EXTENDED ON ACTIVE DUTY TO AWAIT EXAMINATION
RESULTS.  IF AN ACTIVE DUTY EXAMINATION IS TAKEN AND THE MEMBER IS
RELEASED FROM ACTIVE DUTY PRIOR TO PUBLICATION OF RESULTS, THE NAVY
RESERVE ACTIVITY WHERE THE MEMBER IS AFFILIATED SHOULD SUBMIT AN
ADVANCEMENT DETERMINATION REQUEST TO COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4812).
8.  NCS INCENTIVES PAYMENT.
    A.  $5,000 BONUS.  IF THE $5,000 BONUS OPTION WAS SELECTED, THE
ENTIRE BONUS WILL BE PAID UPON COMPLETION OF INITIAL ACTIVE DUTY
OBLIGATION.  NO ACTION IS REQUIRED BY COMMANDS TO EITHER POST OR PAY
THE MEMBER THE NCS BONUS.  PAYMENTS SHOULD POST TO SERVICE MEMBER'S
ACCOUNT DURING THE 15TH MONTH OF THE REQUIRED ACTIVE DUTY OBLIGATION.
    B.  FOR LOAN REPAYMENT AND EDUCATION ALLOWANCE PROCEDURES, REFER
TO MILPERSMAN 1133-080.
9.  DETAILING ISSUES.  NCS PERSONNEL SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR
PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION MOVES UNLESS THEY HAVE RECEIVED APPROVAL
FOR A 24-MONTH EXTENSION FOLLOWING THEIR INITIAL 15-MONTH OBLIGATION
OR UNTIL APPROVED TO REENLIST UNDER THE PTS PROGRAM WHEN ELIGIBLE.
NORMAL SEA/SHORE ROTATION TOURS FOR THE APPROPRIATE RATING WILL BE
FOLLOWED.
10.  THE PROCEDURES DELINEATED IN THIS NAVADMIN WILL BE USED UNTIL
CHANGES ARE IMPLEMENTED IN MILPERSMAN 1133-080.  THE REMAINDER OF
THAT ARTICLE REMAINS IN EFFECT.
