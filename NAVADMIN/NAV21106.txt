SUBJ/CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS THIRD QUARTER FY20 GOLD DISK AWARDEES//

REF/A/JFMM VOLUME VI, CHAPTER 8//

AMPN/REF A IS THE JOINT FLEET MAINTENANCE MANUAL 2M ELECTRONIC REPAIR 
CHAPTER//GENTEXT/

RMKS/1.  In 1997 the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (logistics) implemented 
a CNO monthly Gold Disk Awards Program.  This program was designed to 
encourage fleet personnel in the maritime community to develop gold disk test 
routines and repair circuit card assemblies and electronic modules.  The 
resulting benefits have improved operational readiness of a wide range of C5I 
and HM&E systems in addition to significantly improving OPTAR cost avoidance.  
The award consists of a Letter of Commendation signed by CNO N8, Deputy CNO 
for integration of capabilities and resources and a military cash award of up 
to five thousand dollars.

2.  Recently, the cash award criteria changed to a graduated dollar value 
dependent upon cost avoidance thresholds.  The new award program not only 
rewards the top repair technician, but every technician that meets the 
following quarterly cost avoidance thresholds:
$150k to $199k of cost avoidance yields a $2k award $200k to $249k of cost 
avoidance yields a $3k award $250k to $299k of cost avoidance yields a $4k 
award $300k and over of cost avoidance yields a $5k award

3.  The CNO Gold Disk Awards Program is administered by the NAVSEA miniature 
micro-miniature module test and repair (2M MTR) program manager.  Fleet 2M 
MTR policy and responsibilities are contained in reference (a).  Gold Disk 
Awardees are selected by an awards board at NUWC detachment field engineering 
office in Norfolk.  The MTR engineering agents selection is based on 2M 
repair metrics submitted in the module test and repair tracking system or 
verification of recently submitted gold disk test routines.
