SUBJ/INTRODUCTION OF THE DEFENSE FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY TEST
/VERSION 5 (DLPT V)//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THE DEFENSE FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY TEST
(DLPT) IS MOVING FROM TRADITIONAL PAPER AND PENCIL-BASED TO


PAGE 02 RUENAAA3937 UNCLAS
COMPUTER-BASED TESTING CONDUCTED OVER THE INTERNET WITH THE RECENT
RELEASE OF VERSION 5.  THIS NEW TEST SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGES HOW THE
DOD DEVELOPS AND MEASURES WORK FORCE FOREIGN LANGUAGE SKILLS, AND
WILL BECOME A PRIMARY CERTIFYING MEANS FOR DETERMINING AWARD LEVELS
OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY PAY (FLPP).
2.  BEGINNING THIS FALL SAILORS TESTING IN IRAQI DIALECT, UZBEK,
HINDI, NORWEGIAN, ALBANIAN, URDU, DARI AND PASHTU WILL TEST VIA THE
WEB.  RUSSIAN DLPT V TESTING WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN DECEMBER 2005.
SAILORS REQUIRING TESTS IN OTHER LANGUAGES WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE
PAPER BASED DLPT OR ORAL PROFICIENCY INTERVIEW.  THE GOAL IS
TO CONVERT MOST LANGUAGES NOW TESTED VIA DLPT TO DLPT V FORMAT BY
THE END OF 2008.  ONCE A DLPT V TEST IS INTRODUCED, IT WILL BECOME
THE ONLY OFFICIALLY VALIDATED DLPT FOR CERTIFICATION OF FOREIGN
LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY AND SUBSEQUENT PAYMENT OF FLPP.
3.  THE NEW DLPT TESTS, BEING DEVELOPED BY THE DEFENSE LANGUAGE
INSTITUTE FOREIGN LANGUAGE CENTER IN MONTEREY CA, WILL BE EMPLOYED
ON SPECIFICALLY CONFIGURED COMPUTERS AND TEST SOFTWARE.  TEST
CONTROL OFFICERS WILL DOWNLOAD THE TESTS FROM CENTRAL SERVERS HOSTED
BY THE DEFENSE MANPOWER DATA CENTER IN MONTEREY, CA AND SAILORS WILL
TAKE THE TESTS ONLINE.

4.  DLPT V COMPUTER-BASED TESTING CAPABILITY IS BEING ESTABLISHED
AT MOST NAVY COLLEGE OFFICES, RTC GREAT LAKES, THE U.S. NAVAL
ACADEMY, OTC PENSACOLA AND NEWPORT, ALL NROTC UNITS AND SELECT NAVAL
NETWORK WARFARE COMMAND SITES.  ADDITIONAL CAPABILITY WILL BE ADDED
AT THESE AND OTHER LOCATIONS NECESSITATED BY INCREASED DEMAND FOR
THE TESTS.  FOR A COMPLETE LIST OF DLPT V TEST SITES AND OTHER
IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THESE TESTS, VISIT
HTTPS:/WWW.ADVANCEMENT.CNET.NAVY.MIL, LOG INTO THE SYSTEM AND THEN

5.  DUE TO THE WEB-BASED NATURE OF DLPT V TESTS AND CURRENT
BANDWIDTH LIMITATIONS AFLOAT, TESTING WILL BE CONDUCTED AT SHORE
BASED FACILITIES UNTIL AN AFLOAT TEST CAPABILITY CAN BE DEVELOPED.
TRADITIONAL PAPER-BASED DLPT TESTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ADMINISTERED
AT APPROVED TEST SITES UNTIL THOSE TESTS ARE REPLACED BY THE DLPT V.
6.  MEMBERS NEEDING TO TEST IN ANY LANGUAGE SHOULD CONTACT ONE OF
THE TESTING SITES.
