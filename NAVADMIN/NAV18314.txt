3.  For promotion to the grade of lieutenant, an all-fully- qualified-
officers list (AFQOL) consisting of those officers recommended for promotion 
on their most recent fitness reports will be sent to the Secretary of the 
Navy, who will certify the AFQOL and forward the list to the Secretary of 
Defense.  Those officers determined not fully qualified for promotion will be 
omitted from the AFQOL, constituting a failure of selection (FOS).  The all- 
fully-qualified (AFQ) standard applies to all eligible LTJGs in all 
competitive categories.  The AFQ standard will also be utilized for any 
officers administratively missed when the original lists were compiled.

4.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a promotion selection board.  
Correspondence must arrive not later than 10 calendar days before the 
convening date of the board and shall be addressed to:

    Navy Personnel Command (NPC)
    MyNavy Career Center (MNCC)
    President FY20 Navy Reserve, (Grade), (Line or Staff Corps, as
applicable)
    Promotion Selection Board, Board #XXX, (Board number is a required field 
and may be found on the FY-20 selection board schedule located at 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/selectionboardsupport/Pages/FY20-Board-Schedule.aspx
    5720 Integrity Drive, Millington, TN 38055-6300 To check on receipt of 
your package, go to
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/reserveofficer/Pages/default.aspx or call the MNCC at 833-330-MNCC 
(6622) or askmncc(AT)navy.mil.  Written communication may invite to the 
attention of the board any matter concerning himself/herself that the officer 
considers important.  The written communication must be in accordance with 
MILPERSMAN 1420-010 and may include, as enclosures, correspondence from any 
individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not originated by 
the eligible officer, including endorsements to the officers letter, and 
letters written on behalf of that officer, must contain a written 
acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she desires that such 
correspondence be presented to the board. Correspondence without such 
acknowledgment is considered third party correspondence and will not be 
accepted.

5.  Officers in the grades of lieutenant (junior grade), lieutenant, 
lieutenant commander and commander are elgible for consideration for 
promotion only if they have served continuously on either the RASL or Active-
Duty List (or a combination of both lists) during the 1-year period ending on 
the date of the convening of the promotion board or, in the case of 
lieutenants (junior grade), the commencement of the AFQOL process.  
Accordingly, officers returning to an active status from a period of inactive 
or broken service (USNR-S2, discharge) are eligible for consideration for 
promotion only after continuously serving in an active status for one full 
year.  Membership in the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) does not qualify for 
deferment of eligibility for consideration.

6.  All officers are reminded that it is their responsibility to ensure their 
personnel records are substantially accurate and complete.

7.  The cscselboard(AT)navy.mil mailbox account is capable of receiving 
ENCRYPTED correspondence in line with Department of Defense policy.  If you
