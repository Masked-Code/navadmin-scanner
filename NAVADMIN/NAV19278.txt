RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN is applicable to all DON flying organizations and 
activities that use DoD FLIP and Jeppesen Military Contract Service (JMCS) 
products.

2.  The NGA Aeronautical Content Exploitation System (ACES) is a graphics-
based web application designed to provide DOD customers with immediate access 
to a worldwide aeronautical data repository to include the Electronic 
Instrument Procedures Library.  ACES provides users access to multiple 
geospatial intelligence and aeronautical information data bases (e.g., 
Automated Air Facility Information File (AAFIF), Digital Aeronautical Flight 
Information File (DAFIF), Intel Imagery, Aeronautical Information 
Publications (AIP) and Flight Information Publications (FLIP)).

3.  ACES features a worldwide library of instrument procedures, translated 
into English and delivered in a standardized format.
NGA's E-IPL is now accessible via ACES and NGA's AERO app, but is not yet 
approved for operational use.  Further guidance will be provided when the 
E-IPL is authorized for use.

4.  All mission planners, terminal procedure designers and Naval aircrew are 
directed to begin reviewing and familiarizing themselves with ACES and E-IPL.  
A comprehensive user's guide is accessible in the ACES "help" tab.

5.  Disseminate to user level.  Users will need to create an account on the 
NGA ACES website at:  https://aerodata.nga.mil/AeroBrowser/, from a CAC-
enabled NIPRNET computer.  Upon account creation, users may access ACES via a 
username and password from any computer on the World Wide Web at 
https://aerodata.leidos.com/index.html.  Users can find the ACES users guide 
under the "help" tab.

6.  Users should report any ACES issues directly to NGA via the feedback 
button located in the upper right corner of the ACES homepage.

7.  Due to ACES and E-IPL not being suitable for operational use the JMCS 
contract has been extended through 29 FEB 2020.  Jeppesen products will 
continue to be available to all Navy and Marine Corps aircrew through the 
Jeppesen website and Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) applications, Foreflight and 
Flightdeck Pro.  As the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) 
transitions to E-IPL, Jeppesen products will no longer be available through 
the ACES website, but will continue to be available to DOD aircrew directly 
through the Jeppesen web site at:  https://www.jeppesen.com/elink/.  Users 
are required to create an account on the Jeppesen website at:  http://www 
.jeppesen.com/aviation/military/echarts-online-registration.jsp.

8.  The OPNAV N9 POC for this message is CDR Daniel Pugh; 
COM: (703)695-2630; DSN: 224-2630.
