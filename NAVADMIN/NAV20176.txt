RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a) and announces the full 
rollout of the Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) for use during Permanent 
Change of Station (PCS) travel.  The GTCC for PCS travel is a proven 
capability providing Sailors and their families a reliable mean of financial 
support during a PCS move.  This represents another MyNavy HR milestone 
toward delivering better quality of service to Sailors and their families 
through a modernized pay and personnel process.

2.  Effective immediately, all Active-Duty and Full-time Support
(FTS) Sailors conducting Continental U.S. (CONUS) or Outside CONUS
(OCONUS) PCS moves, single or traveling concurrently or non- concurrently 
with dependents, are authorized to use the GTCC in accordance with the 
policies outlined in this NAVADMIN.  Commanders will ensure widest 
dissemination of this new policy.
Note:  For Sailors choosing to use the GTCC for PCS travel and not traveling 
concurrently with dependents, a travel advance for dependent travel, if 
desired, must be requested via the existing process.  The GTCC may be used 
only by the Sailor and not by the dependents.

3.  Background
    a.  Reference (b) announced the GTCC for PCS pilot program and provided 
applicable policy and guidance.  The intent of the GTCC for PCS use was to 
provide Sailors with another means of funding PCS travel without the need for 
a travel advance or use of their own funds.
    b.  Since August 2019, metric analysis and feedback from across the Fleet 
have proven the use of the GTCC during PCS beneficial for Sailors and their 
families.  Although travel advances remain an option for Sailors, the GTCC 
provides immediate access to travel entitlements without having to request an 
advance or risk possible delays in the disbursement of funds.  The timing for 
the full capability fielding was planned to coincide with the summer PCS move 
season surge, which now includes addressing the backlog of thousands of sets 
of delayed orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  This option has already 
afforded PCS travelers flexibility, reassurance and financial stability for 
unforeseen costs resulting from the stop movement order.

4.  Policy
    a.  Active-Duty and FTS Navy only.  This NAVADMIN does not apply
to:
        (1) Sailors under accession, separation or retirement orders
        (2) Civilian personnel
        (3) Selected Navy Reserve personnel
        (4) Individual Mobilization Augmentees
        (5) Individual Ready Reserve Navy personnel
    b.  Use of the GTCC is authorized for the following travel
expenses:
        (1) Temporary Lodging Expense or Temporary Lodging Allowance
(TLA) at the old or new permanent duty station (PDS)
        (2) Fuel for a Privately Owned Vehicle (POV), when POV is the 
authorized mode of transportation
        (3) Rental car and fuel, when a rental car is authorized on orders
        (4) Lodging and meals enroute
        (5) Dislocation Allowance (DLA) related expenses normally used to 
establish a household
        (6) Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) withdrawals
Note:  ATM fees are not a separately reimbursable expense
    c.  GTCC use is not authorized in the following cases:
        (1) GTCC use cannot be combined with an electronic funds 
transfer/direct deposit travel advance (e.g. advanced DLA and per
diem)
        (2) Personally procured moves, formerly known as do-it- yourself 
(DITY) moves
        (3) Commercial airfare for PCS travel.  Commercial airfare will 
continue to be booked by the Navy Passenger Transportation Office.  No 
commercial airfare charges will be made to a Sailors GTCC account.
        (4) Personal travel arrangements incurred during leave in conjunction 
with orders.  See reference (d) for further details.
        (5) Medical expenses

5.  Cardholder Instructions
    a.  Several advantages and protections exist for Sailors using the GTCC 
in lieu of personal credit cards, including but not limited
to:
        (1) No interest charges on the account
        (2) GTCC credit limits can be temporarily increased if needed to meet 
mission requirements
        (3) 24/7 customer service support from Citibank and PCS Traveler GTCC 
Support through MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) (dial 833- 330-MNCC for PCS 
travel assistance)
        (4) GTCC accounts used for PCS are placed in PCS/Mission Critical 
status to ensure payment is not due until 60 days after check-in at the new 
PDS
        (5) Automatic travel accident insurance
        (6) Automatic common carrier baggage insurance
    b.  Enhanced Customer Support.  Navy Personnel Command, in coordination 
with Naval Supply Systems Command and Citibank, has established a *GTCC for 
PCS* Support Cell within MNCC Contact Center.
This *GTCC for PCS* Support Cell is easily reached through the MNCC Contact 
Center and is staffed with Command Pay and Personnel Administrator (CPPA) and 
GTCC subject matter experts who will provide real time support to Sailors 
using their GTCC for PCS purposes after detaching from their previous 
command.
         (1) Any cardholder who requires assistance during the PCS travel 
period should take action in the following order:
             (a) Contact Citibank from anywhere in the world 24/7 using the 
phone numbers on the back of the card.  In emergency situations, Citibank 
will assist the cardholder under their *no strand* policy.
             (b) For non-emergent matters, contact the MNCC GTCC for PCS 
Support Cell.  The GTCC for PCS Support Cell will assume responsibility as 
Agency Program Coordinator (APC) for the GTCC account and can assist with 
card activation, credit limit modifications and PCS/Mission Critical status 
enrollment or re- enrollment.  Note:  It may take up to 24 hours for changes 
to be made to an individual account.
             (c) Contact MNCC at 833-330-MNCC (6622) or via e-mail at 
askmncc(at)navy.mil.
    c.  Use of the GTCC in excess of the estimated PCS travel entitlement 
could result in a personal indebtedness to Citibank.
Sailors are encouraged to use the PCS Entitlements Calculator located in 
MyPCS Mobile to get an accurate estimate of PCS travel entitlements.
    d.  Misuse.  Commanders/supervisors will ensure Sailors using travel 
cards are advised of GTCC use for PCS limitations.  Examples of misuse 
include, but are not limited to:
        (1) Expenses unrelated to PCS travel
        (2) ATM cash withdrawals made more than 3 working days prior to 
official government travel
        (3) Intentional failure to pay undisputed charges in a timely manner
        (4) Personal use or entertainment of any kind
    e.  Prior to detachment of personnel, commanders/supervisors are to 
ensure cardholders have verified receipt of their GTCC and the command APC 
has activated and placed accounts into a PCS/Mission Critical status.
    f.  Cardholders shall submit travel claims within 5 working days of 
arrival at the new PDS as outlined in reference (d).  MyPCS Mobile provides a 
convenient and simple option for travel claim submission.  Sailors are 
encouraged to use MyPCS Mobile in order to submit their digital travel claim 
within the 5 day requirement.
When the travel claim is complete, ensure the split-disbursement option is 
selected if GTCC was used during the PCS move.  This action will ensure the 
charge card bill is paid on time.
Note:  OCONUS TLA reimbursement claims (using NPPSC form 7220/5) are 
processed as an addition to a Sailors pay through NSIPS.  There is no split 
disbursement option for this payment, so Sailors need to file their TLA claim 
promptly and ensure timely payment to Citibank for any charges related to 
TLA.
    g.  Cardholders must self-register for access to Citimanager in order to 
receive online GTCC statements at www.citimanager.com/login.  Upon arrival at 
new PDS, Sailors must check in with their command APC and update their 
address in Citimanager.

6.  Sailors without a GTCC do not have to be in receipt of PCS orders to 
apply for their GTCC.  Sailors are strongly encouraged to apply for a card as 
soon as possible.  Contact your command APC for assistance.  If necessary, an 
expedited application may be submitted if within 1 month of a projected 
rotation date.  See Article 409 of reference (e) for expedited application 
procedures or contact your command APC.  If already detached from the 
previous command, an expedited application may be submitted through the GTCC 
for PCS Support Cell.

7.  Amplifying CPPA/APC/Travel Office instructions will be issued separately 
via routine program office communication methods.

8.  To evaluate GTCC program effectiveness, collect feedback for continued 
process improvement and measure Sailor satisfaction, we request that Sailors 
who use the GTCC during PCS complete a brief survey available at 
https://surveys.max.gov/index.php/737856?lang=en.

9.  To better assist you during the PCS process, download MyPCS Mobile to 
view your orders, complete the self-guided PCS checklist, use the 
entitlements calculator and to submit an electronic travel claim.  MyPCS 
Mobile can be found in the Navy application locker at 
https://www.applocker.navy.mil or via MyNavy Portal at https://my.navy.mil.

10.  For questions contact MNCC at 833-330-MNCC (6622) or via e-mail at 
askmncc(at)navy.mil.
