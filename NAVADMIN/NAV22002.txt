RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supports references (a) through (c) and announces the 
assignment optimization plan for active component and training and 
administration of reserve (TAR) chief petty officers (CPOs).  Commander, Navy 
Personnel Command (COMNAVPERSCOM), Enlisted Assignment Division (PERS-40) 
will work with the Fleet readiness integrators (FRI), type commanders 
(TYCOMs) and budget submitting office (BSO) N1 staffs to evaluate all CPOs 
assigned to billets with incorrect paygrades or those who are not aligned to 
funded billet requirements.  The goal of this optimization plan is to ensure 
our most experienced enlisted Sailors are aligned to billets which 
specifically need their training, leadership and experience.  This plan will 
lead to the realignment of CPOs into billets appropriate to their skills and 
experience. 
 
2.  COMNAVPERSCOM will host a virtual senior enlisted manning summit in 
Millington, TN from 28 February to 4 March 2022.  In person groups supporting 
the virtual summit will be governed by the applicable health protection 
condition restrictions, see local guidance for specifics.  During 
registration for the summit, attendees have and will be provided with 
specific risk mitigation instructions.  The aim of this summit will be to 
review all CPO assignments, with the goal of aligning the maximum number of 
chiefs to chief billets.  This summit will allow Fleet and TYCOMs to work 
with COMNAVPERSCOM to fill their most impactful gapped billets. 
    a.  Enlisted Readiness and Placement Branch (PERS-4013) provided a list 
of misaligned CPOs to the FRIs.  The FRIs distributed the list of misaligned 
Sailors to the TYCOM and BSO N1s.  Prior to the summit, PERS-4013 will 
evaluate CPO billet requirements in MyNavy Assignment (MNA) and, if the 
billets are filled by Sailors outside of the billet paygrade, the incumbent 
may be realigned to an in-paygrade requirement or placed in excess aboard the 
current command. 
This will ensure that personnel assignment stakeholders have a clear demand 
signal of valid CPO requirements.  After completion of the summit, if CPOs 
are identified for movement, PERS-4013 will submit personnel manning action 
requests via MNA.  If there are no near-term movements required, Sailors 
may have their projected rotation date (PRD) adjusted to enter the order 
negotiation window earlier than their current PRD. 
        (1) CPOs who have their PRD adjusted will be considered a sea or 
shore roller based on a ratio of sea and shore duty billets available within 
their paygrade. 
        (2) CPOs should expect to negotiate for orders to fill an in-paygrade 
requirement in all follow on assignments. 
    b.  Enlisted manning stakeholders identified in paragraph 1 shall review 
misaligned personnel, as well as Fleet billet vacancies, and provide their 
recommendations for action at the manning summit. 
    c.  Fleet readiness concerns will guide all decisions and actions, but 
each move will be considered on a case-by-case basis to minimize impacts to 
our Sailors and their families. 
    d.  The movement of realigned personnel will begin in the April 2022 
timeframe. 
 
3.  The summit precept requires participants to maintain integrity without 
prejudice or partiality for all Sailors evaluated.  Each participant must pay 
particular attention to each Sailor and billet to ensure that they are 
meeting the intention of CPO optimization.  During deliberations, 
participants may discuss any negative impacts a realignment may have on the 
command or the Sailor.  Before any decisions are made, TYCOM/BSO and FRIs 
will provide their input.  If the requested actions are within one FRI, the 
FRI will make final decisions.  If the requested action involves more than 
one FRI and there is a disagreement, the manning control authority will make 
the final decision.  A copy of the precept will be provided to the 
participants by the summit coordinators. 
 
4.  Fleet activities shall continue evaluating MNA alignments to ensure that 
Sailors are accurately aligned aboard the current activity.  CPOs should be 
aligned to billets for their specific paygrades.  If Sailors of any paygrade 
need to be realigned to another billet, the command activity manning manager 
(AMM) should submit a member realignment request in MNA.  If the MRR is 
approved, PERS-4013 will update the alignment.  AMMs should reach out to 
their command placement coordinator in PERS-4013 with any issues, questions 
or concerns. 
 
5.  Key messages 
    a.  Sailors.  We are working to better align our enlisted supervisors to 
billets which require their skills and experience.  The emphasis on 
operational readiness and unit prioritization reflect our identity as a sea 
service.  We must preserve the readiness of the Fleet and ensure that CPOs 
are optimally assigned to meet mission readiness.  We will take each Sailors 
personal considerations into account, but I know that this may induce 
additional hardship for some Sailors and their families, and I sincerely 
thank them for their service and sacrifice. 
    b.  Commands.  Commanders, commanding officers, executive officers and 
command master chiefs must ensure their Sailors understand the intent of this 
message.
