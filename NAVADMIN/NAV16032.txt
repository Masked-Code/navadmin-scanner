RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN is to remind all Commanders that per references (a) 
through (c), Service members must comply with all DoD travel guidance.  On 15 
January 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assigned 
travel advisories, Alert Level 2-Practice Enhanced Precautions, for the 
Caribbean, Central America, and South America, including Mexico and Puerto 
Rico.  CDC issued these advisories due to ongoing Zika virus transmission and 
concern the virus may cause serious birth defects in the unborn children of 
women infected during pregnancy.  Spread of the virus through blood 
transfusion and sexual contact has also been reported.

2.  Commanders will ensure Service members traveling to Zika virus affected 
areas, whether on duty or in a leave status, are aware of these travel 
advisories to include compliance with appropriate personal protective 
measures to prevent mosquito bites and minimize chances of infection.  Female 
Service members who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant should consult 
with their healthcare providers before traveling to the affected regions.  
Finally, Commanders will advise Service members to make their family members 
aware of the CDC travel advisories and encourage female family members who 
are pregnant or trying to become pregnant to consult with their healthcare 
providers before traveling to these regions.

3.  Zika virus is transmitted by mosquitoes prevalent throughout the 
Americas, that most often bite during the day.  These are the same mosquitoes 
that transmit Chikungunya and Dengue viruses.  Locally acquired Zika 
infections have also been reported in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific islands.  
There is no vaccine or medication available to prevent Zika infection.  The 
most effective way to prevent infection is to practice strict mosquito bite 
preventive measures. Proper personal protective measures to minimize mosquito 
bites are detailed in reference (d).

4.  Zika virus symptoms may include fever, rash, headache, joint and muscle 
aches, and red irritated eyes.  However, four out of five people infected 
with the virus may never develop symptoms.  For those who do, symptoms 
typically last two to seven days.

5.  All Service members or family members who have traveled to Zika affected 
areas and suspect that they may have been infected with Zika virus should 
inform their healthcare providers immediately and report their travel 
history.  This is particularly important for pregnant Service and family 
members.
