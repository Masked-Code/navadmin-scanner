TECHNOLOGY USED THEREIN.  

3.  BACKGROUND.  REF A LAUNCHED THE FEDERAL DATA CENTER CONSOLIDATION 
INITIATIVE (FDCCI) DIRECTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGENCY AND DEPARTMENT 
DATA CENTER CONSOLIDATION (DCC) PLANS.  WITH REF B, DON CIO 
SUBSEQUENTLY PROMULGATED GUIDANCE LIMITING INVESTMENT IN DATA CENTERS 
AND ESTABLISHING PRIORITIZATION FOR THE USE OF EXISTING DATA CENTERS 
ACROSS THE DON, USN, USMC AND DEFENSE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AGENCY.  TO 
REINFORCE FDCCI OBJECTIVES AND ENSURE THAT A HIGH DEGREE OF SCRUTINY 
IS APPLIED TO INVESTMENTS IN DOD DATA CENTERS, CONGRESS INCLUDED 
LANGUAGE IN NDAA 2012 THAT RESTRICTS THE OBLIGATION OF FUNDS FOR DOD 
AND COMPONENT DATA CENTERS; REF C PERTAINS. 

4.  DATA CENTER DEFINITION.  IAW REF D, OMB REVISED THE DEFINITION OF 
A DATA CENTER AS "A CLOSET, ROOM, FLOOR OR BUILDING FOR THE STORAGE, 
MANAGEMENT, AND DISSEMINATION OF DATA AND INFORMATION.  SUCH A 
REPOSITORY HOUSES COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND ASSOCIATED COMPONENTS, SUCH AS 
DATABASE, APPLICATION, STORAGE SYSTEMS AND DATA STORES.  A DATA CENTER 
GENERALLY INCLUDES REDUNDANT OR BACKUP POWER SUPPLIES, REDUNDANT DATA 
COMMUNICATIONS CONNECTIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS (AIR CONDITIONING, 
FIRE SUPPRESSION, ETC.) AND SPECIAL SECURITY DEVICES HOUSED IN LEASED 
(INCLUDING BY CLOUD PROVIDERS), OWNED, COLLOCATED, OR STAND-ALONE 
FACILITIES.  UNDER THIS REVISED DEFINITION, NEITHER SQUARE FOOTAGE 
NOR UPTIME INSTITUTE TIER CLASSIFICATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO DEFINE A 
FACILITY AS A DATA CENTER." THIS DEFINITION EXCLUDES FACILITIES 
EXCLUSIVELY DEVOTED TO COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORK EQUIPMENT (E.G., 
TELEPHONE EXCHANGES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ROOMS).

5.  POLICY AFTER 1 MAY 2012.  USING THE DEFINITION CONTAINED IN PARA 
4 ABOVE, ORGANIZATIONS WILL ASSESS DATA CENTER REQUIREMENTS TO 
DETERMINE IF THEY CAN BE SATISFIED BY EXISTING DOD RESOURCES.  
ORGANIZATIONS WILL ALSO ASSESS THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY 
(I.E., HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE) USED TO OPERATE A DATA CENTER.  ONLY 
AFTER DETERMINING THAT A REQUIREMENT CANNOT BE MET WITH EXISTING 
RESOURCES, AND THAT SUCH A REQUIREMENT ACCORDS WITH THE PERFORMANCE 
STANDARDS AND MEASURES ESTABLISHED BY DOD CIO, SHALL AN IT 
PROCUREMENT REQUEST INVOLVING A DATA CENTER BE SUBMITTED.  THE 
REQUEST SHALL BE MADE IAW REF E.  UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, ANY 
OBLIGATION OF FUNDS FOR DATA CENTERS AND/OR INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
TECHNOLOGY USED THEREIN MUST BE APPROVED BY DOD CIO PER REF F. 
REQUESTS FOR APPROVAL SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO DDCIO(N) WHO WILL 
REVIEW AND FORWARD THEM TO DOD CIO VIA DON CIO.  

6.  GUIDANCE.  PENDING FURTHER DOD CIO AND DON CIO GUIDANCE, DOD CIO 
APPROVAL IS NOT REQUIRED FOR THE FOLLOWING PROCUREMENT ACTIONS:

B.  ANYTHING NOT USED, SUCH AS TECHNOLOGY AND PHYSICAL SPACES, TO 
OPERATE A DATA CENTER
C.  END USER DEVICES AND ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE LICENSES
D.  SERVICE, SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS (E.G., WARRANTY 
SUPPORT; PREVENTIVE, ROUTINE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE) FOR 
EXISTING CAPABILITIES USED TO OPERATE A DATA CENTER
E.  SOFTWARE FOR SYSTEMS HOSTED WITHIN A DATA CENTER, INCLUDING NEW 
APPLICATIONS FOR MISSION SUPPORT, BUT NOT INCLUDING SOFTWARE SYSTEMS
AND APPLICATIONS USED TO OPERATE A DATA CENTER
F.  PATCHING SOFTWARE, ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE AND MONITORING SYSTEMS 
SERVICING AN ENTIRE SEGMENT OF THE NETWORK (POSSIBLY INCLUDING 
A DATA CENTER) 

7.  TO CAPTURE REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR COMPLIANCE WITH REFS C AND 
E, THE NAVY INFORMATION DOMINANCE APPROVAL SYSTEM (NAV-IDAS) SHALL 
BE USED FOR AUTHORIZED COMMANDS; THE MANUAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
PROCUREMENT REQUEST (ITPR) FORM WILL BE USED BY ALL OTHER COMMANDS. 
THE DCC TASK FORCE WILL APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE THE REQUEST IN 
NAV-IDAS OR VIA THE MANUAL ITPR FORM AS APPROPRIATE.
