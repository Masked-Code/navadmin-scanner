RMKS/1.  The Navy Foreign Area Officer (FAO) Community seeks motivated 
waterfront leaders to join the Navy's community of strategic operators, who 
leverage strategic thinking and human connections to deliver outcomes for the 
Navy and Joint Force.

2. Background
    a. Foreign Area Officers leverage waterfront leadership, strategic 
thinking, operational acumen, and human connections to deliver integrated 
deterrence effects, outpace adversaries, and deliver combined, joint and 
fleet access to create a geo-strategic posture advantage to promote maritime 
security, ensure sea control and to project power.
    b. Keeping the fight forward in today’s increasingly complex global 
security environment requires persistent forward presence, and FAOs provide 
an indispensable human element of the Navy’s global posture. FAOs work across 
all levels of the integrated fleet, the joint force, and the inter-agency as 
the Navy’s security cooperation professionals and political-military affairs 
experts serving as naval diplomats assigned to embassies. FAOs focus on 
delivering strategic and operational outcomes alongside Allies & Partners 
around the world.
    c. FAOs orient to five geographic regions (CENTCOM, INDOPACOM, SOUTHCOM, 
EUCOM, and AFRICOM). The community assigns FAOs to an Area of Responsibility 
(AOR) after selection for lateral transfer, based on preferences, career 
timing, qualifications, and community needs.
    d. Approximately 2/3 of FAO billets are overseas. Typical in-region 
billets include Embassy Security Cooperation and Defense Attach Offices, and 
OCONUS-based Joint and Navy staffs.
When not in region, FAOs serve on staff assignments at CONUS- headquartered 
Geographic Combatant Commands, Navy Component Commands, OPNAV, Office of the 
Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Department of State and in other 
interagency appointments.
    e. Navy FAOs serve in 82 countries around the world including remote but 
strategically important locations.
Assignments can be in non-permissive and oppressive environments where the 
United States needs a footprint on the ground to influence regional or global 
decisions and deepen American understanding of the geo-strategic environment.
Multiple overseas postings in such settings require individual and family 
resilience, high states of readiness, iron-clad ethical behavior, and 
leadership skills well-suited to lead teams of high-impact inter-agency and 
multinational partners.
The mission is challenging, highly impactful, and personally rewarding.

3. Application and Selection Process
    a. Lateral Transfer Board. Officers may apply for lateral transfers semi-
annually (February and August) as part of the regularly scheduled Navy Active 
Duty Officer Lateral Transfer and Re-designation boards. Officers from all 
designators may apply for lateral transfer into the FAO Community after a 
minimum of 4 years of commissioned service (YCS). Most applicants enter prior 
to 12 YCS, with a smaller number of more senior gains filling targeted 
requirements. Minimum eligibility and application requirements include:
        (1) Minimum 4 years commissioned service.
        (2) Current overseas suitability screening for applicant and all 
dependents, showing world-wide assignability to CENTCOM (NSA Bahrain) 
standards, documented on NAVPERS 1300/16 'Report of Suitability For Overseas 
Assignments'.
        (3) Proof of TS/SCI clearance eligibility (letter from SSO).
        (4) Personal Statement including ranked AOR preferences.
        (5) Documentation of DLAB score 110 or higher (scores between
95 to 109 will be considered on a case by case basis).
        (6) Within 18 months of PRD.
        (7) Completed interview with a designated panel, led by an O-6 FAO.
    b. Surface Warfare Officer (SWO)  FAO Tailored Career Transition (TCT). 
The SWO-FAO TCT program provides a pathway for SWOs to lateral transfer to 
the FAO community on completion of their SWO Department Head (DH) tours. 
Following the annual SWO DH Screening Board, PERS-41 will advertise the 
opportunity to apply for SWO-FAO TCT. Officers selected for SWO-FAO TCT will 
be assigned to a region in accordance with reference (a), and detailed to 
complete FAO training requirements in close coordination with the FAO Junior 
Detailer during the officers post Division Officer shore tour. Training 
requirements include an international security affairs masters degree and 
language training, and will take between 24-36 months depending on the 
officers assigned region. SWO-FAO TCT officers will complete SWO DH training 
and SWO DH tours as an 1110. SWO-FAO TCT officers will be automatically re-
designated to 1710 upon successful completion of their SWO DH tours and a 
favorable record review screening by the FAO OCM, and then be assigned to 
their next assignment at their normal PRD.

4. FAO Qualifications. Once accepted for lateral transfer to FAO, the FAO-in-
trainings first set of orders is typically a PCS to Monterey, CA, Newport, RI 
or Washington D.C. to commence the training track which will give the officer 
the academic, cultural and linguistic tools to build on the strong foundation 
in leadership, naval strategy and operational principles. All new FAOs should 
aspire to gain full qualification as soon as possible so that they can put 
those skills to use and continue to promote through the ranks as a FAO. Full 
qualification is achieved through the attainment of the following milestones:
    a. Masters degree in International Relations, Strategic Studies, or 
Regional Studies.
    b. Score of 2 in at least two of the three modalities (i.e., listening, 
reading, and speaking) on the Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) or 
Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI) in a foreign language of the FAOs assigned 
region.
Following initial qualification, FAOs are expected to sustain their language 
skills and actively pursue an Interagency Language Roundtable proficiency 
level of 3/3/3 for their assigned language(s) while utilizing OPNAV N13F 
Language, Regional Expertise and Culture Office (LREC) support via individual 
training plans.
    c. One-year experience in a FAO billet in the assigned region.
