SUBJ/MARITIME ADVANCED WARFIGHTING SCHOOL OPPORTUNITIES FOR AY2012-2013 AND 
BILLET CODING FOR SKILLED OPERATIONAL PLANNERS//

RMKS/1.  MARITIME ADVANCED WARFIGHTING SCHOOL (MAWS) AT THE NAVAL WAR COLLEGE 
(NWC).  COMMANDS SHOULD ENCOURAGE THEIR HIGHEST CALIBER OFFICERS TO APPLY TO 
THIS CAREER ENHANCING SCHOOL.  THIS MESSAGE ALSO ADVISES NAVAL STAFFS TO 
ENSURE THEIR PLANNER BILLETS ARE APPROPRIATELY CODED TO RECEIVE SUFFICIENT 
NUMBERS OF THESE SKILLED OPERATIONAL RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN SOLICITS 
APPLICATIONS FOR THE ACADEMIC YEAR 2012-2013 PLANNERS.

2.  CNO ESTABLISHED MAWS (FORMERLY THE NAVAL OPERATIONAL PLANNER COURSE) AT 
THE NWC IN 1998.  THIS 13-MONTH SCHOOL IS CONDUCTED CONCURRENTLY WITH THE 
COLLEGE OF NAVAL COMMAND AND STAFF, PROVIDING OFFICERS OF ALL U.S. MILITARY 
SERVICES WITH SPECIALIZED ADVANCED WARFIGHTING EDUCATION WHILE THEY COMPLETE 
JOINT PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION (JPME) PHASE I REQUIREMENTS.  THE MAWS 
PROVIDES A THOROUGH PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION THAT PREPARES OFFICERS FOR FUTURE 
OPERATIONAL - LEVEL COMMAND AND STAFF ASSIGNMENTS.  IT IS AN ENABLER OF CNO'S 
GUIDANCE TO DEVELOP NAVY EXPERTISE AT THE OPERATIONAL LEVEL OF WAR.  

2.A.  OFFICERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO SEEK ASSIGNMENT TO THE NWC RESIDENT 
INTERMEDIATE LEVEL COLLEGE AND MAWS, AS WELL AS TO THE OTHER ADVANCED 
WARFIGHTING SCHOOLS:  U.S. MARINE CORPS SCHOOL OF ADVANCED WARFIGHTING (SAW); 
U.S. ARMY SCHOOL OF ADVANCED MILITARY STUDIES (SAMS); U.S. AIR FORCE SCHOOL OF 
ADVANCED AIR AND SPACE STUDIES (SAASS); AND THE JOINT ADVANCED WARFIGHTING 
SCHOOL (JAWS).  NAVY GRADUATES OF JAWS AND THE OTHER SERVICE ADVANCED 
WARFIGHTING SCHOOLS ALSO RECEIVE THE JP1 AQD.  THE MAWS CLASS CONVENES IN 
AUGUST AND AT OTHER SERVICE SCHOOLS IN JULY.  

2.A.1.  OFFICERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN MAWS BUT NOT YET DETAILED TO NWC SHOULD 
SEEK QUOTAS FROM THEIR DETAILERS NOW.  OFFICERS WHO ARE IN RECEIPT OF ORDERS 
TO THE AUGUST CONVENING OF THE COLLEGE OF NAVAL COMMAND AND STAFF AT NWC, AND 
WHO DESIRE TO BE CONSIDERED FOR MAWS SELECTION, SHOULD ALSO CONTACT THEIR 
DETAILERS TO MAKE THE REQUEST.  MORE INFORMATION ABOUT MAWS IS AVAILABLE ON 
THE NWC WEB PAGE AT, HTTP://WWW.USNWC.EDU/ACADEMICS/SPECIAL-
PROGRAMS/MAWS.ASPX.

2.B.  THE MAWS PROGRAM EMPHASIZES CREATIVE, CRITICAL THINKING; DEVELOPMENT AND 
REFINEMENT OF LEADERSHIP SKILLS; AND DELIBERATE, CONTINGENCY, AND CRISIS 
PLANNING AT THE OPERATIONAL LEVEL.  THIS COURSE OF STUDY IMPARTS NAVAL AND 
JOINT PLANNING PROCESS COMPETENCIES TO FRONT-RUNNING OFFICERS.  IT PREPARES 
THEM TO CAPABLY LEAD OPERATIONAL PLANNING TEAMS IN COMPLEX CRISES AND ADVISE 
MAJOR STAFF COMMANDERS.  THE MAWS DEVELOPS LEADERSHIP AND WARFIGHTING DECISION 
MAKING SKILLS THAT PREPARE GRADUATES TO COMMAND EFFECTIVELY WITHIN THEIR 
WARFARE COMMUNITIES AND IN THE JOINT WARFIGHTING ENVIRONMENT.

2.C.  MAWS GRADUATES EARN JPME PHASE ONE CERTIFICATION, THE MASTER OF ARTS 
DEGREE IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND STRATEGIC STUDIES, AND THE JP1 ADDITIONAL 
QUALIFICATION DESIGNATOR (AQD).  THE JP1 AQD IS SUBSEQUENTLY UPGRADED TO JP3 
WHEN THE OFFICER SERVES IN A MAJOR STAFF OPERATIONAL PLANNING BILLET.

3.  OPNAV N3/N5 IS THE SPONSOR OF MAWS AND THE JPX (JP1/2/3) AQD FAMILY, AND 
IN CONCERT WITH THE NAVAL WAR COLLEGE, PROACTIVELY MANAGES AND DEVELOPS THE 
COMMUNITY OF OPERATIONAL PLANNERS.  THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS ARE ESSENTIAL TO 
MAXIMIZING THE BENEFIT OF THIS CRITICAL OFFICER EDUCATION FOR HIGH PERFORMING 
OFFICERS, HEADQUARTERS STAFFS, AND THE LARGER JOINT COMMUNITY:

3.A.  NAVY AND JOINT STAFFS SHOULD ENSURE ALL APPROPRIATE OPERATIONAL PLANNER 
BILLETS ARE CODED JP3.  THE JP3 BILLET CODE IS THE TRIGGER FOR ASSIGNMENT OF 
JPX-CODED OFFICERS.  JP1-CODED MAWS GRADUATES ARE ABLE TO FILL JP3-CODED 
BILLETS AND ARE AVAILABLE FOR PCS IN THE SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER TIMEFRAME.  ALL 
OTHER ADVANCED WARFIGHTING SCHOOL GRADUATES ARE AVAILABLE IN JUNE.  DIRECT 
COMMUNICATION WITH NAVPERSCOM PLACEMENT OFFICERS IS ENCOURAGED TO ENSURE 
ACCURATE CODING OF BILLETS.

3.A.1.  STAFFS ARE ALSO ENCOURAGED TO COMMUNICATE WITH NAVPERSCOM DETAILERS TO 
MAXIMIZE THE SELECTION OF JP3-QUALIFIED OFFICERS FOR FILLS IN JP3-CODED 
BILLETS.

3.B.  NAVY AND JOINT STAFFS THAT HAVE NON-JPX QUALIFIED OFFICERS FILLING JP3 
BILLETS SHOULD ENCOURAGE THOSE OFFICERS TO APPLY TO PERS-45E FOR THE JP2 AQD.  
JP2 ANNOTATES PERFORMANCE OF A JP3-CODED BILLET, BUT WITHOUT HAVING SATISFIED 
THE JP1 ACADEMIC QUALIFICATION.  THIS CAPTURES THE VALUABLE WORK AND PLANNING 
EXPERIENCE OF THESE OFFICERS, AND ALIGNS THEM FOR FUTURE CODING AS JP3-
QUALIFIED OFFICERS AFTER COMPLETION OF MAWS.

4.  DEVELOPING FUTURE NAVY LEADERSHIP AND EXPERTISE AT THE OPERATIONAL LEVEL 
OF WAR THROUGH THE MAWS PROGRAM IS ESSENTIAL TO THE NAVY SUCCESSFULLY MEETING 
THE CHALLENGES OF MARITIME, JOINT, INTERAGENCY, AND MULTI-NATIONAL OPERATIONAL 
PLANNING EFFORTS.  COMMANDERS SHOULD IDENTIFY AND ENCOURAGE THEIR FRONT-
RUNNING OFFICERS TO APPLY FOR AN IN-RESIDENT MAWS EDUCATION AT THE NAVAL WAR 
COLLEGE AND ENSURE THEIR BILLETS ARE CORRECTLY CODED TO CAPTURE THE ACCURATE 
DEMAND FOR THESE PLANNERS.
