SUBJ/MARINE CORPS 248TH BIRTHDAY// 
 
1. ON BEHALF OF ALL UNITED STATES NAVY SAILORS AND CIVILIANS, I WANT TO WISH 
THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS A HAPPY 248TH BIRTHDAY. 
 
2. THROUGHOUT THEIR STORIED HISTORY, MARINE CORPS WARRIORS HAVE FOUGHT FROM 
THE SEA AND ON LAND TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY AND PURSUE OUR NATION'S INTERESTS. 
THEY DID SO ON LAND IN CHAPULTEPEC AND HELMAND AND FROM THE SEA IN TRIPOLI 
AND IWO JIMA. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO WIN OUR NATION'S BATTLES IN THE FUTURE 
AND ARE READY FOR ANY CHALLENGE DURING THIS DECISIVE DECADE. 
 
3. FOR 248 YEARS, THE NAVY-MARINE CORPS TEAM HAS STOOD THE WATCH, PRESERVED 
PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, AND RESPONDED IN CRISIS, COMPETITION, AND CONFLICT. 
WE HAVE FOUGHT, BLED, AND WON TOGETHER IN FARAWAY WATERS AND IN DISTANT 
LANDS. AND, WE HAVE ENSURED THE CONTINUED PROSPERITY AND SAFETY OF AMERICA, 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND OF FREEDOM LOVING PEOPLE ACROSS THE GLOBE. THERE IS 
NO DOUBT OUR NAVAL FORCE - OUR SAILORS AND MARINES - IS THE GREATEST 
WARFIGHTING FORCE THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN. 
 
4. I CANNOT IMAGINE A BETTER TEAM TO WORK WITH, CAMPAIGN WITH, AND WIN WITH. 
WE HAVE NO GREATER TEAMMATE AND PARTNER THAN THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS. 
TOGETHER, WE ARE AMERICA'S NAVAL FORCE AND WE ARE ALWAYS STRONGER TOGETHER. 
 
5. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MARINES! SAILORS AROUND THE WORLD CELEBRATE THIS HISTORIC 
DAY WITH YOU. SEMPER FIDELIS!
