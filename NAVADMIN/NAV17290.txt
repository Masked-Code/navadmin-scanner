RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces updates to the Navy High Year Tenure (HYT) 
policy by amending the E3 HYT length of service (LOS) gate for Active 
Component (AC) and Full Time Support (FTS) personnel.  Revisions to reference 
(a) are forthcoming and will also encompass updates in the announcement made 
in reference (b).  All other HYT policy contained in references (a) and (b) 
remains in effect.

2.  The HYT policy of the Navy establishes LOS gates by paygrade. It is a 
vital tool used to manage the force and promote continuous advancement 
opportunity.  Changes to Navy HYT policy are directly linked to Fleet 
readiness.  As the Navy works to increase Fleet Fit/Fill, we have closely 
examined how we can expand retention of talented and experienced Sailors.  
Effective 1 February 2018, HYT policy for pay grade E3 AC and FTS Sailors is 
amended to reflect the new LOS gate of 6 years (vice 5 years).

3.  For those personnel who have been planning to separate under current HYT 
LOS, the following information and guidelines are provided:
    a.  Obtaining permission to reenlist.  Members who currently have 
approved HYT separation dates on or after 1 February 2018 must decide whether 
to cancel their HYT separation orders and remain on active duty or execute 
their orders as originally planned.  For Sailors who decide to stay, 
permission to reenlist or extend to the new HYT date must be requested no 
later than 31 January 2018 from Bureau of Naval Personnel Enlisted Community 
Manager (BUPERS-32) for all non-nuclear-trained AC and FTS members, and 
Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV N133) for all nuclear-trained 
AC members.
Members in receipt of HYT separation orders who have executed any portion of 
those orders, to include movement of household goods or dependents, shall 
include this information in their request to reenlist or extend for 
consideration by BUPERS-32/OPNAV (N133) on a case-by-case basis.  BUPERS-
32/OPNAV (N133) will forward approved requests to PERS-40.
    b.  Navy-Wide Advancement Exams (NWAE).  Sailors must maintain 
advancement eligibility as outlined in reference (c) to participate in the 
March 2018 NWAE, cycle 239 as published in reference (d).
    c.  Detailing Process.
        (1) Sailors on sea duty (type 2, 3, and 4) who have not completed 
their prescribed tour as a result of the previous HYT policy will have their 
projected rotation date (PRD) extended at their present duty station to meet 
their normal tour length, or until their new HYT date, whichever is closest.
        (2) Sailors assigned to shore duty (type 1 and 6) may be assigned to 
sea duty or other higher priority billets based on needs of the Navy and will 
have their PRDs established to match their new HYT date.
        (3) Sailors who are not in receipt of HYT separation orders but are 
within 7 months of their newly established PRD must contact their detailer 
who can make a Career Management System Interactive (CMS-ID) application for 
them in the next CMS-ID cycle.
        (4) Sailors who are in their normal 12-month negotiation window 
should submit an application via CMS-ID and will follow the normal detailing 
process.

4.  Points of contact.  For HYT policy related questions, commands and 
members may contact:
    a.  BUPERS-32 for all non-nuclear-trained AC and FTS members at
(901) 874-3234/DSN 882.
    b.  OPNAV (N133) for all nuclear-trained AC members at (703) 604-5492/
DSN 664.
    c.  The Navy Personnel Customer Service Center at 1(866) U-Ask-NPC (827-
5672).//

5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.

6.  Released by Vice Admiral R. P. Burke, N1.//
