DAY// GENTEXT/REMARKS/DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE// RMKS/1.  THE UNITED STATES 
CONGRESS ESTABLISHED THE DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE AS OUR NATION'S ANNUAL 
COMMEMORATION OF VICTIMS OF THE HOLOCAUST.  THIS YEAR'S OBSERVANCE WILL 
TAKE PLACE APRIL 15 THROUGH APRIL 22.  HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY IS 
APRIL 15.
2.  THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WAS MARKED BY MANY EXTRAORDINARY ADVANCES IN 
SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND MEDICINE, FROM POWERED FLIGHT AND SPACE 
EXPLORATION, TO ANTIBIOTICS AND ORGAN TRANSPLANTS.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE 
CENTURY ALSO WITNESSED THE EXPANSION OF BIGOTRY, PREJUDICE, ETHNIC, 
RACIAL HATRED, AND TRIBAL RIVALRIES DEGRADED INTO GENOCIDE - THE 
INTENTIONAL AND SYSTEMATIC DESTRUCTION OF A RACIAL, POLITICAL OR 
CULTURAL GROUP.  THE HOLOCAUST, AN ATTEMPT BY NAZIS TO KILL ALL JEWISH 
AND ROMANI (GYPSY) PEOPLE, WAS THE FIRST GOVERNMENT ORGANIZED ATTEMPT 
IN MODERN HISTORY TO ERADICATE OTHER RACES FOR NO REASON THAN THEIR 
MEMBERSHIP IN A RELIGIOUS, RACIAL, ETHNIC, NATIONAL, OR CULTURAL GROUP.
3.  SADLY, THE HOLOCAUST WAS NOT THE LAST GENOCIDE.  INSTEAD IT HAS 
COME TO REPRESENT THE ACTS OF GENOCIDE WHICH HAVE OCCURRED SINCE; AND 
SERVES TO REMIND US OF THE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF BIGOTRY, PREJUDICE 
AND RACISM.
4.  AS IN MANY TRAGEDIES, THE HOLOCAUST ALSO PROVIDED NUMEROUS 
INSTANCES OF PERSONAL HEROISM.  NON-JEWISH AND NON-ROMANI RISKED THEIR 
LIVES AND THE LIVES OF THEIR FAMILIES TO SAVE OTHERS, SIMPLY BECAUSE IT 
WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.  THE MEMORY OF THE HOLOCAUST REMINDS PEOPLE 
AROUND THE WORLD THAT WE ARE EACH CALLED TO SPEAK OUT IN THE FACE OF 
INJUSTICE AND THAT EVERYONE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
5.  COMMANDS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO OBSERVE HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE 
DAY THROUGH EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, EXHIBITS, PUBLICATIONS, AND 
PARTICIPATION IN MILITARY AND COMMUNITY EVENTS WHICH COMMEMORATE THIS 
DAY AND TO RECOGNIZE AND PROMOTE THE DIVERSITY OF OUR AMERICAN CULTURE.
