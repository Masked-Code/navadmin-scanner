AMPN/REF A IS THE DOD FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REGULATION.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE SEA DUTY INCENTIVE PAY 
(SDIP) PROGRAM.  SDIP IS A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE PAY PROGRAM FOR MEMBERS OF 
SPECIFIC ENLISTED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE WILLING TO VOLUNTARILY EXTEND THEIR SEA 
DUTY OR CURTAIL THEIR SHORE TOUR.  SDIP ELIGIBILITY IS CONTINUALLY REVIEWED IN 
ORDER TO MOST EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY SUPPORT THE FLEET'S AT-SEA MANNING 
REQUIREMENTS.
RECENTLY, TO BETTER SUPPORT THESE REQUIREMENTS, THE NUMBER OF SEA-CENTRIC 
GROUPS ELIGIBLE FOR SDIP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED.
SAILORS AND CAREER COUNSELORS ARE HIGHLY ENCOURAGED TO VISIT THE NAVY 
PERSONNEL COMMAND WEBSITE AT:
HTTP://WWW.PUBLIC.NAVY.MIL/BUPERS-NPC/CAREER/PAYANDBENEFITS/PAGES/
SDIP.ASPX FOR A LIST OF CURRENT ELIGIBLE RATINGS, SDIP POLICY, GUIDELINES, 
POINTS OF CONTACT, AND PROGRAM UPDATES.  THE SDIP POLICY GUIDELINES CONTAIN 
ADDITIONAL DETAILS SUCH AS PAYMENT AMOUNTS, BUSINESS RULES, AND EXAMPLES OF 
REQUIRED SDIP PAGE 13 ENTRIES.

2.  ELIGIBILITY.  THE SDIP PROGRAM IS LIMITED TO ACTIVE COMPONENT PERSONNEL 
SERVING IN ENLISTED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UNDERMANNED AT SEA.  AT THIS TIME, 
RESERVE COMPONENT MEMBERS (INCLUDING FULL TIME
SUPPORT) ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR SDIP.

3.  PER REF A, THE SDIP PROGRAM HAS TWO INCENTIVES, SDIP-EXTENSION
(SDIP-E) AND SDIP-CURTAILMENT (SDIP-C):
    A.  SDIP-E ALLOWS SAILORS TO VOLUNTARILY EXTEND THEIR SEA DUTY ASSIGNMENT 
ON A SHIP, SUBMARINE, OR AVIATION SQUADRON, WITH COMMAND APPROVAL, IN EXCHANGE 
FOR RECEIPT OF A LUMP-SUM PAYMENT BASED ON THE LENGTH OF THE EXTENSION.
    B.  SDIP-C ALLOWS SAILORS TO VOLUNTARILY CURTAIL THEIR CURRENT SHORE DUTY 
ASSIGNMENT AND RETURN TO SEA DUTY EARLY, WITH COMMAND APPROVAL, IN EXCHANGE 
FOR A LUMP-SUM PAYMENT BASED ON THE LENGTH OF THE CURTAILMENT.

4.  APPLICATION PROCESS.  SDIP ELIGIBLE SAILORS MUST SUBMIT APPLICATIONS 
(NAVPERS 1306/7) TO THEIR RATING DETAILER.
APPLICATIONS FOR SDIP-E MUST BE SUBMITTED AT LEAST 10-12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THEIR 
CURRENT PROJECTED ROTATION DATE.  APPLICATIONS FOR SDIP-C SAILORS MUST BE 
SUBMITTED AT LEAST THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO THEIR REQUESTED DATE OF EARLY 
DEPARTURE.

5.  THE POINT OF CONTACT FOR A SAILOR WITH QUESTIONS REGARDING THE SDIP PROGAM 
IS THEIR COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR (CCC) OR COMMAND LEADERSHIP TEAM.  FOR 
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS OR CLARIFICATION, A CCC, NOT THE INDIVIDUAL SAILOR, IS 
ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT COMNAVPERSCOM
(PERS-40) AT (901) 874-3545/DSN 882-3545 OR VIA E-MAIL AT 
MILL_SDIP(AT)NAVY.MIL.
