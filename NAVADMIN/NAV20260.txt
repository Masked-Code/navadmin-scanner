RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the fiscal year 2021, academic year (AY) 
2021 and 2022 Fleet Scholars Education Program (FSEP). 
 
2.  Background 
a.  Fleet Scholars Education Program (FSEP) is a Navy talent management 
initiative that selects high performing unrestricted line and information 
warfare community officers to attend in-residence educational programs. 
Selected participants will attend in-residence graduate school at an 
accredited institution of their choice (Continental United States, Alaska 
and Hawaii). 
b.  FSEP participants have up to 24 months to complete a graduate degree 
while in full-time student status. Participants will be required to choose 
a degree from the approved areas of study list located within the Policy 
Update section.  Distance learning, executive master of business 
administration, night/weekend/part-time programs structured for the 
working professional, medical, and legal education programs are not 
authorized graduate programs under FSEP. 
c.  Officers who have already received fully-funded graduate education are 
not eligible to participate.  Graduate degrees obtained through Post 9-11 
G.I. Bill, tuition assistance or the Navy College Program for Afloat 
College Education are not impacted by this program.  Selectees will be 
assigned a unique additional qualification designation for tracking and 
career management purposes. 
 
3.  Application and Selection Process 
a.  Community sponsors will develop and implement selection criteria and 
policies to identify their most talented and proven performers for FSEP 
participation.  Community sponsors will make selections no later than 
31 October 2020 and submit to Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Warfighting Development (N7), Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) Civilian 
Institutions (CIVINS) program office, and Navy Personnel Command, 
Graduate Education and Training Placement (PERS-440) in order to meet 
Academic Year (AY) 21-22 fall/winter semester/quarter start dates.  The 
Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC, 1140) community selection 
notification will be made to the selectees in December 2020.  FSEP is 
nominally focused on URL and IWC officers in the paygrades O-3 and O-4. 
Each community sponsor may select up to their annual allocated graduate 
education opportunities shown below:

b.  Upon notification of selection by the Navy, FSEP selectees should 
apply to at least three accredited graduate education institutions of 
their choice.  Participants may be reimbursed for up to three

quarter.  Participants shall consult the list of schools that already 
have education service agreements (ESA) with the Navy on the NPS

where the school of choice is not on the ESA listing, the selectee shall 
notify the NPS CIVINS office no less than 7 months prior to the program 
start to allow sufficient time to pursue additional ESAs.  Participants 
are responsible for researching and completing prerequisites including 
graduate record examinations where applicable.  Starting enrollment and

2021 to begin the fall/winter term of AY 21-22.
