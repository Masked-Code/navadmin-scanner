RMKS/1.  Before announcing our Navy nominees selected to compete for the 2018 
SECDEF Maintenance Awards, I want to personally thank the numerous commands 
who took time to recognize the tremendous contributions from your field-level 
maintenance units and depot -level maintenance programs in accordance with 
references (a) and (b).  Your continued participation in this competition 
ensures that our outstanding maintenance teams are recognized for their 
remarkable efforts and support they provide to our warfighters.  It was an 
honor to review such a competitive field of deserving units.  This years 
submittals represented the very best of Navy maintenance, making it 
particularly challenging to select our nominees to compete as finalists 
against the rest of the Department of Defense (DoD) maintenance community.

2.  Annually, the SECDEF will select six winners from across the DoD to be 
awarded the SECDEF Field-Level Maintenance Award, two from each competitive 
category (small, medium, and large).  From these six winning units, one will 
be selected as the best of the best and named the annual SECDEF Phoenix Award
