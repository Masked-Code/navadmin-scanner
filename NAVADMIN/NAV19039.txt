RMKS/1.  George Washington said, It follows then as certain as that night 
succeeds the day, that without a decisive naval force we can do nothing 
definitive, and with it, everything honorable and glorious. Part of the honor 
and glory of naval service is that we as Sailors have a unique connection to 
all elements of national power: military, economic, and diplomatic. Put 
simply, the Navy is a symbol that projects American values to the world.  
Just as the Navy embodies the values and principles that we hold dear, our 
very appearance in port and at anchor communicates important messages.

2.  This NAVADMIN directs the display of the Union Jack in lieu of the First 
Navy Jack aboard Navy ships and craft.  All U.S. Navy ships shall display the 
Union Jack in accordance with section 1259 of reference (a) beginning at 
morning colors on Tuesday, 4 June 2019.  Reference (b) will be updated to 
reflect this change.

3.  The Union Jack is a flag consisting of 50 white stars, representing each 
of the 50 states, on a blue background.  A version of this Jack first flew in 
1777 and was updated as new States joined the Union.  The Union Jack 
symbolizes the cumulative strength of our Nation and of our Navy, where the 
whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

4.  A version of the Union Jack flew when Commodore Perry formally 
established relations with the Empire of Japan.  A version of the Union Jack 
flew in harbors around the world as the Great White Fleet circumnavigated the 
globe.  A version of the Union Jack flew in ports throughout the Pacific as 
the Navy island-hopped its way across the vast ocean, and in the Atlantic as 
the Navy supported operations to liberate the European continent.  Put 
simply, the Union Jack is deeply connected to our heritage and our rise as a 
global nation with a global Navy.

5.  The date for reintroduction of the Union Jack commemorates the greatest 
naval battle in history: the Battle of Midway, which began on 4 June 1942.

6.  Make no mistake: we have entered a new era of competition.  We must 
recommit to the core attributes that made us successful at
Midway: integrity, accountability, initiative, and toughness.  For more than 
two hundred and forty years, the Union Jack, flying proudly from jackstaffs 
aboard U.S. Navy warships, has symbolized these strengths.

7.  The Union Jack is supported by two NSNs:  Union Jack 50 Star (Daily), NSN 
8345-00-656-1447 and Union Jack 50 Star (Holiday), NSN 8345-00-656-1448.  
Ships and craft authorized to fly the Union Jack are required to have both 
flags as part of their Flag Bag.  DLA Troop Support currently has sufficient 
stock on hand for both NSNs to support additional demand from the fleet in 
the future.

8.  The Navy will re-establish the custom in which the commissioned ship in 
active status having the longest total period in active status (other than 
USS CONSTITUTION) will display the First Navy Jack until decommissioned or 
transferred to inactive status.  As of 4 June 2019, the only warship 
authorized to fly the First Navy Jack is USS BLUE RIDGE (LCC 19).

9.  This NAVADMIN does not affect the wearing of the First Navy Jack patch as 
an optional uniform component on TYPE II/III Navy Working Uniforms.
