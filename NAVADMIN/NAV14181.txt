RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces convening of the November 2014
Active-Duty Officer Lateral Transfer/Redesignation Board on
17 November 2014.  One element of Navy's personnel program is to
properly balance the skills and experience in the officer corps.  As
part of the process, applications from qualified unrestricted line,
restricted line, staff corps, and limited duty officers (LDO) are
now being accepted for an Active-Duty Officer Lateral Transfer/
Redesignation Board.  Full-Time Support and Selected Reserve
officers are not eligible to apply for this board.

2.  In addition to the year group (YG) limitations imposed in
paragraph 6, applicants must also meet eligibility requirements
detailed in refs (a) through (c).  Members who do not meet
eligibility requirements per refs (a) through (c), such as
time-in-grade (TIG), years of commissioned service (YCS), or time in
service must submit a waiver package, in addition to their lateral
transfer/redesignation application.  Waiver packages must include
member's waiver request and commanding officer's endorsement.  This
endorsement is separate from any endorsements contained in the
member's lateral transfer/redesignation application and must
specifically address the eligibility requirement for a waiver.

3.  Submit applications and waiver packages per ref (b) to:
    Navy Personnel Command
    Customer Service Center
    November 2014 Active-Duty Lateral Transfer/Redesignation

7.  Notes:
    a.  Must have surface warfare officer (SWO) qualification
completed to apply for transfer.  Officers under SWO continuation
pay or revised junior critical skills retention bonus contract are
not eligible for transfer until completion of bonus obligation.
SWOs serving under an agreement for any of the SWO bonuses are
eligible to apply to the board if the board application due date is
within one year of satisfaction of the full bonus obligation.
    b.  Waivers to the requirements of paragraph 4h of ref (b) for
nuclear-trained surface and submarine warfare officers may be
considered, on a case-by-case basis.
    c.  Officers screened "not cleared" for their next career
milestone are eligible.
    d.  The YG range provided displays possible opportunities.
Contact your specific community placement officer with questions
regarding quota availability for each platform/community.  All
officers YG-00 and senior are eligible, regardless of platform/
community.
    e.  Aerospace maintenance duty officer (AMDO) out-quotas are
extremely limited.  Redesignation requests shall be reviewed on a
case-by-case basis with careful consideration given to impact on
overall community health.
    f.  Judge advocates looking to laterally transfer to another
community should be aware that upon lateral transfer to another
community, they will lose the three years of constructive credit
provided to judge advocates upon commissioning.  As a consequence,
some junior officers with less than four years of total service
looking to laterally transfer may be reduced in rank to lieutenant
junior grade.
    g.  LDO redesignation requests will be reviewed on a
case-by-case basis, considering impact to overall community health.
Nuclear LDO submissions will not be considered.  All other
designators must have completed four years commissioned service and
accepted permanent LDO appointment to lieutenant prior to lateral
transfer/redesignation.  LDO out-quotas are extremely limited.
Special consideration will be given to officers projected to be
statutorily separated for years of service prior to attaining the
rank of commander.  Supply Corps and Information Dominance Corps
applicants in YGs 09 and senior will receive favorable
consideration.
    h.  Officers in YG-11 and senior seeking lateral transfer into
the surface warfare community are strongly encouraged to contact the
SWO community manager prior to applying in order to discuss critical
SWO career milestone requirements.
    i.  Only restricted line and staff corps selections to the naval
special warfare (NSW) community will be processed via this board.
Unrestricted line applications for NSW will not be considered by
this board.  All applicants must be eligible for top secret/
sensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI) security clearance, be
worldwide assignable, meet requirements of ref (d), and pass a
physical screening test per ref (e).
    j.  Board applicants commissioned under a valid SWO-option
agreement (engineering duty (ED), intelligence (Intel), information
professional (IP), information warfare (IW), oceanography (OCEANO))
must contact their respective restricted line option community
manager regarding desire to be released from the SWO-option
agreement and seek lateral transfer to a different community.
    k.  Officers without a warfare qualification are expected to
submit an application for the ED dolphin program.  Contact the ED
community manager for additional guidance.
    l.  Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the AMDO
community manager to discuss milestones and qualifications
commensurate with YG.
    m.  Officers applying for IP, IW or Intel communities:
lieutenant commander applicants for 1820 with more than two years
TIG should contact the IP community manager to discuss milestone and
performance requirements.  All officers who are either above or
in-zone for FY-16 promotion to lieutenant commander through captain
will not be considered for lateral transfer.  IP, IW, and Intel
applicants must be eligible for TS/SCI, submit a personnel security
questionnaire per ref (f), or include a letter from a special
security officer indicating successful completion of an SCI
pre-screening interview.  IW applicants that do not hold or are not
currently eligible for TS/SCI must complete an SCI eligibility
pre-screening interview with the fleet cyber command security
directorate field office at (850) 452-6868 and submit the results as
part of their application.  All applicants must be worldwide

assignability shall be verified and documented via successful
overseas screening to Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command
standards (e.g., Bahrain) to include family members.  Candidates

(DLAB).
        (1) DLPT/OPI level 2 or higher, DLAB score greater than 120
are highly desirable.
        (2) Applicants without a regionally-focused master*s degree
must have an academic profile code (APC) of 265 or better, or an
undergraduate grade point average of at least 2.62.  The following
paragraphs provide rank and year group specific information for
