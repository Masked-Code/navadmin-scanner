documentation to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-83), copy to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806).

4.  COs are reminded of their responsibility to ensure the officers they are 
promoting are mentally, physically, morally and professionally qualified in 
accordance with section 624 of title 10, U.S. Code.  In line with reference 
(a), officers are ineligible for promotion if they have failed the most 
recent Physical Fitness Assessment.  COs shall verify the promoting officer's
