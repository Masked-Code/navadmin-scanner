UPDATE #2.//

RMKS/1.  The Navy has been working hard to implement changes as part of the 
new physical fitness assessment (PFA) policy per references (a) through (c).  
This NAVADMIN outlines and clarifies changes to the Physical Readiness 
Information Management System (PRIMS), the official database for PFA data, 
and provides direction for its use effective Cycle 1, 2016.

2.  The PRIMS is being reprogrammed to reflect changes within the Physical 
Readiness Program, to facilitate the capture of all PFA data and to ensure 
the security and integrity of the database. PRIMS functionality is being 
updated using a phased approach.  The first phase is planned for release at 
the beginning of Cycle 2, 2016.  This phase will give CFLs the ability to 
enter PFA data and allow Sailors to view their PFA data.  Changes include:
    a.  Physical readiness test (PRT) performance categories.
    b.  Abdominal circumference measurements to the body composition 
assessment.
    c.  Graduated body fat percentages by age.
    d.  Command fitness leader (CFL) recertification requirements.

3.  For Cycle 1, 2016:
    a.  Sailors should continue to complete a paper copy of the Physical 
Activity Risk Factor Questionnaire (PARFQ) (NAVPERS Form 6110/3).  CFLs 
should retain paper copies for a minimum of five years.  The requirement to 
enter PARFQs into PRIMS is rescinded for Cycle 1, 2016 only.  However, 
entering PARFQs for Cycle 1, 2016 is strongly encouraged.
    b.  It is the responsibility of individual Sailors to obtain medical 
clearance for participation in the PRT.  Completed PARFQ and medical 
waiver/clearance forms are required to be turned into your CFL.  The new 
PARFQ and medical clearance/waiver forms are available for download at 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/support/21st_Century_Sailor/physical/Pages/default2.aspx.

4.  CFLs must ensure all PFA score sheets are maintained in hard copy for 
future input into PRIMS.  Official PFA score sheets must be retained at the 
command for a period of five years.  CFLs should not place any Sailors 
transferring from their command into a transfer status in PRIMS until their 
PFA data is entered into the system. CFLs must provide all transferring 
Sailors with copies of their score sheets or a signed Navy Memorandum 
containing their PFA information.  Sailors are responsible for providing the 
score sheets or Navy memorandum to the CFL at their next duty station.

5.  The remaining phases will increase CFLs ability to generate different 
reports, Fitness Enhancement Program functionality and planned for completion 
prior to the end of FY-16.

6.  CFLs are strongly encouraged to visit the Navys Physical Readiness 
Program website at http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/support/21st_Century_Sailor/physical/Pages/default2.aspx for updates 
during this phased roll-out of PRIMS.

7.  Point of contact is Mr. William G. Moore, N170B, and can be reached at 
(901) 874-2210/DSN 882 or via e-mail at PRIMS(at)navy.mil.
