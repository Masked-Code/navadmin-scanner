SUBJ/FY-12 QUOTA-BASED ENLISTED RETENTION BOARD - UPDATE// 

REF/A/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON DC/141348ZAPR11// REF/B/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON 
DC/092227ZMAY11// NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 129/11, FY-12 QUOTA-BASED ENLISTED 
RETENTION BOARD.  REF B IS NAVADMIN 160/11, FY-12 QUOTA-BASED ENLISTED 
RETENTION BOARD CONVERSION REQUIREMENTS, TIMELINE, AND PROCESS.// 

RMKS/1.  IN RESPONSE TO FLEET FEEDBACK FROM DEPLOYED UNITS, THIS NAVADMIN 
PROVIDES CLARIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR THE ENLISTED RETENTION BOARD (ERB) 
SPECIFIED IN REF A, AND REVISES RATING CONVERSION TIMELINE AND PROCESS 
SPECIFIED IN REFS A AND B.

2.  TO ENSURE EVERY SAILOR ELIGIBLE FOR THE BOARD IS AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO SUBMIT A CONVERSION REQUEST PACKAGE, THE DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF CONVERSION 
APPLICATIONS HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO 15 AUGUST 2011.  THIS EXTENSION WILL ENSURE 
THOSE SAILORS UNDERWAY AND DEPLOYED ARE NOT DISADVANTAGED FOR CONVERSION 
CONSIDERATION, AND WILL ALLOW PROCESSING OF THE ARMED FORCES CLASSIFICATION 
TEST (AFCT, I.E., IN-SERVICE ASVAB) AND OTHER TESTS PRIOR TO THE SUBMISSION OF 
CONVERSION PACKAGES.

3.  TO ENSURE OUR BEST SAILORS ARE AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE IN 
THEIR RATE, CONVERSION APPLICATIONS RECEIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CRITERIA 
SPECIFIED IN REF B, BY 15 AUGUST 2011, WILL BE HELD UNTIL THE BOARD HAS 
COMPLETED ITS DELIBERATIONS.  ONLY THOSE SAILORS NOT SELECTED FOR RETENTION IN 
RATE BY THE ERB WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR CONVERSION.  THOSE SAILORS SUBSEQUENTLY 
SELECTED FOR CONVERSION WILL HAVE THEIR ERB RESULTS VACATED AND WILL BE 
RETAINED IN THEIR NEW RATING.  ALL SAILORS ELIGIBLE FOR THE BOARD, IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH REF A, WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD.

4.  SHOULD ERB CANDIDATES DECIDE TO WITHDRAW OR CHANGE THEIR CONVERSION 
APPLICATION PACKAGE, THAT REQUEST MUST BE RECEIVED IN WRITING BY 15 AUGUST 
2011 BY THE BUREAU OF NAVAL PERSONNEL
(BUPERS-3) AT THE ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN REF B.

5.  ERB QUOTA UPDATES.
    A.  FINAL UPDATE OF ESTIMATED ERB QUOTAS FOR E4 AND E5 WILL
    BE

BE POSTED TO THE NPC ERB WEBSITE AFTER ERB PHASE I AND PHASE II HAVE CONVENED 
ON 22 AUGUST 2011 AND 26 SEPTEMBER 2011, RESPECTIVELY.

6.  ELIGIBILITY CLARIFICATION.  REF A ESTABLISHED END OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED 
SERVICE AS EXTENDED ("SOFT" EAOS, OR SEAOS) AS 1 OCTOBER
2012 OR LATER AS A CRITERION FOR ELIGIBILITY.  THE INTENT IS TO EXCLUDE THOSE 
WHO ARE SUBJECT TO PTS ADJUDICATION IN FY-12 FROM THE POPULATION OF ERB-
ELIGIBLE SAILORS.  AS A RESULT, THOSE WITH A SEAOS PRIOR TO 1 OCTOBER 2012 WHO 
ARE NOT SUBJECT TO PTS ADJUDICATION, BUT WHO ARE ERB-ELIGIBLE IN ALL OTHER 
RESPECTS, WILL BE REVIEWED BY THIS BOARD.  THIS INCLUDES ALL E6 SAILORS WITH 
OVER 14 YEARS OF ACTIVE SERVICE AND LESS THAN 15 YEARS, AND E7 AND E8 SAILORS 
WITH AT LEAST
7 YEARS OF ACTIVE SERVICE AND LESS THAN 15 YEARS, AS COMPUTED FROM THEIR 
ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE DATE.  ALL ERB-ELIGIBLE PERSONNEL SHOULD CONSIDER APPLYING 
FOR CONVERSION TO AN UNDERMANNED RATING (AS IDENTIFIED IN REFS A AND B).

7.  EXEMPTION CLARIFICATION.
    A.  PERSONNEL SELECTED FOR A COMMISSIONING PROGRAM, TO
    INCLUDE
SAILORS CURRENTLY IN AN ENLISTED COMMISSIONING PROGRAM AND THOSE SELECTED FOR 
AN ENLISTED COMMISSIONING PROGRAM, ARE EXEMPT FROM THIS BOARD.
    B.  SINCE APPLICATIONS FOR RATING CONVERSION WILL NOT BE PROCESSED UNTIL 
AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE BOARD, RATING CONVERSION WILL NO LONGER BE A 
CRITERION FOR EXEMPTION.
