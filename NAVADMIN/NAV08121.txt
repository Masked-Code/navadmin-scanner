RMKS/1. NAVY'S STRATEGIC VISION IS TO REMAIN THE PREEMINENT MARITIME 
POWER, PROVIDING OUR COUNTRY A GLOBAL NAVAL EXPEDITIONARY FORCE 
COMMITTED TO GLOBAL SECURITY AND PROSPERITY WHILE DEFENDING OUR 
HOMELAND AND OUR NATION'S VITAL INTERESTS AROUND THE WORLD. THIS VISION 
UNDERLIES THE IMPERATIVES AND CORE CAPABILITIES OF THE COOPERATIVE 
STRATEGY FOR 21ST CENTURY SEAPOWER AND THE INITIATIVES AND MISSIONS OF 
THE NAVAL OPERATIONS CONCEPT (NOC). HOWEVER, ACHIEVING THESE 
IMPERATIVES IN A DYNAMIC AND UNCERTAIN SECURITY ENVIRONMENT CAN GIVE 
RISE TO COMPETING STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS FOR CAPABILITY, CAPACITY AND 
CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT. IN TURN, THESE COMPETING STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS 
CONFRONT A FISCAL ENVIRONMENT IN MANY WAYS AS DYNAMIC AS THAT OF THE 
SECURITY ENVIRONMENT. 
2. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, DOD IS PREPARING FOR THE NEXT QDR - A 
COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION OF NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY, FORCE STRUCTURE, 
FORCE MODERNIZATION PLANS, INFRASTRUCTURE, BUDGETS, AND OTHER ELEMENTS 
OF THE DEFENSE PROGRAM AND POLICIES OF THE DEFENSE ESTABLISHMENT. THE 
GOAL OF QDR IS TO DEFINE U.S. DEFENSE STRATEGY FOR THE FOLLOWING FOUR 
YEARS AND PROVIDE BROAD DIRECTION FOR THE DEFENSE PROGRAM OVER THE NEXT 
20 YEARS. ADDITIONALLY, AS DIRECTED IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2008 NATIONAL 
DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT, PRECEDING EACH QDR BY ONE TO TWO YEARS IS A 
SEPARATE QUADRENNIAL REVIEW OF DOD ROLES AND MISSIONS (QRM). 
RECONCILING THE ASPIRATIONS AND NEEDS OF STRATEGY WITH THE REALITIES OF 
BUDGET AND EXECUTION REQUIRES EXTENSIVE INTEGRATION OF ANALYSIS AND 
OPINION IN INTELLIGENCE; STRATEGY AND POLICY; CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS, 
RESOURCES, READINESS AND ACQUISITION; AND MANPOWER.  
3. THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS (CNO) HAS DIRECTED THE ESTABLISHMENT 
OF A PERMANENT ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE NAVY STAFF TO SUPPORT NAVY ROLES 
AND RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY AND THE CHAIRMAN OF 
THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF FOR CONDUCTING BOTH REVIEWS. NAVY QDR 
INTEGRATION GROUP (DNS-QDR) WILL LEAD THIS RECONCILIATION BY BRINGING 
TOGETHER THESE DISPARATE AND INDEPENDENT SOURCES OF ANALYSIS AND 
OPINION TO CREATE AN INTEGRATED DESCRIPTION AND VIEW OF HOW NAVY 
STRATEGICALLY ADDRESSES CURRENT AND FUTURE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS VIA 
SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT AND EXECUTION PLANS.
4. DIRECTOR, NAVY QDR INTEGRATION GROUP IS RADM(SEL) BILL BURKE AND 
WILL REPORT TO THE CNO VIA THE DIRECTOR, NAVY STAFF (DNS). 
DIRECTOR, DNS-QDR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPERVISING, COORDINATING, 
SUPPORTING, AND ADMINISTERING ALL NAVY QDR/QRM EFFORTS. IN ORDER TO 
RAPIDLY STAND UP DNS-QDR, DEEP BLUE HAS TRANSITIONED AND ALL BILLETS 
HAVE REALIGNED TO DNS-QDR ALONG WITH OTHER SELECTED BILLETS WITHIN THE 
OPNAV STAFF. BEYOND THE EXECUTION OF SPECIFIC QRM/QDR RESPONSIBILITIES, 
DNS-QDR WILL ASSIST ALIGNING AND INTEGRATING OPNAV STAFF ACTIVITIES.
5. THE DNS-QDR FRAMEWORK INCLUDES AN ORGANIZATIONAL CONSTRUCT AND 
IDENTIFIES SELECTED KEY ACTIVITIES THAT WILL SUPPORT THE FOLLOWING 
OBJECTIVES: 
A. USING THE EXPERTISE AND ANALYSIS OF NAVY HEADQUARTERS AND 
SUBORDINATE STAFFS, PROVIDE SENIOR NAVY LEADERSHIP COMPREHENSIVE 
DECISION SUPPORT THAT DESCRIBES THE INTEGRATION OF STRATEGIES, CONCEPTS 
AND CURRENT/FUTURE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS WITH INVESTMENT, SUPPORT 
AND MANPOWER PLANS - INCLUDING AREAS WHERE STRATEGY AND PLANS DIVERGE.
B. LEAD NAVY EFFORTS IN AND SERVE AS THE PRIMARY NAVY STAFF CONDUIT TO 
OSD AND THE JOINT STAFF IN DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF QDR 
STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND DETERMINATION AND REVIEW OF DOD ROLES AND 
MISSIONS.
C. IN COORDINATION WITH CHINFO, COMMUNICATE TO EXTERNAL AUDIENCES HOW 
NAVY CAPABILITIES, PLANS AND PROGRAMS IMPLEMENT DEFENSE AND NAVY 
STRATEGIES.
D. IN COORDINATION WITH NAVY HEADQUARTERS STAFF, EXAMINE AND EVALUATE 
FACTORS OUTSIDE THE NORMAL NAVY PROGRAM PLANNING HORIZON THAT COULD 
AFFORD STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES, OR AFFECT OR DISRUPT EXISTING 
STRATEGIES, INVESTMENTS, AND PLANS.
