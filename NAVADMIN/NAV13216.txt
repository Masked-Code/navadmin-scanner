REF/A/DOC/BUPERS/20APR11// 
REF/B/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON DC/N00/181228ZJUL13// 
NARR/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1610.10C, THE NAVY PERFORMANCE EVALUATION SYSTEM.  
REF B IS NAVADMIN 181/13, IMPLEMENTATION OF NAVY SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION 
AND RESPONSE PROGRAM INITIATIVES. 

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN is to announce the release of change transmittal 1 to 
ref (a).  This change to the performance system reinforces the importance of 
evaluating Sailors on their contributions to Command or Organizational 
Climate/Equal Opportunity and Military Bearing/Character, and provides 
guidance on evaluating performance in these two areas.  

2.  Every Sailor is accountable on every evaluation or fitness report for 
contributions to Command or Organizational Climate/Equal Opportunity and 
Military Bearing/Character.  I want to reinforce to raters the importance of 
these two performance traits.  These changes should be viewed as 
complementary and synchronized with the command climate survey outcomes 
provided to commanding officers and immediate superiors in command in ref 
(b).  To achieve high marks in these areas, Sailors must demonstrate how they 
have cultivated or maintained command climates where improper discrimination 
of any kind, sexual harassment, sexual assault, hazing, and other 
inappropriate conduct is not tolerated; where all hands are treated with 
dignity and respect; and where professionalism is the norm.  

3.  A summary of the change transmittal follows:
    a.  No changes were made to the actual FITREP and EVAL forms.
    b.  Command or Organizational Climate/Equal Opportunity and Military 
Bearing/Character traits.  The guidance reporting seniors should use when 
evaluating subordinates has changed.  Blocks "34" 
and "35" on officer fitness reports, "35" and "37" on chief petty officer 
evaluations and blocks "35" and "36" on enlisted evaluations are now required 
to clearly evaluate how a Sailor has directly contributed to, improved, or 
sustained a productive and professional command climate.
    c.  To achieve high makes in the above blocks, Sailors must demonstrate 
how they have cultivated or maintained a positive command climate.  These 
blocks will be used to show how each Sailor reinforces a climate where sexual 
harassment, sexual assault, hazing, discrimination of any kind, and other 
inappropriate conduct are not tolerated. 

4.  An electronic downloadable copy of this change transmittal is available
