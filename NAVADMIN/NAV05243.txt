GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  SUICIDE PREVENTION AND CONCERN FOR SAILORS'
WELL-BEING ARE ALWAYS A FOCUS OF NAVY LEADERSHIP.  IN 2004, THE NAVY
HAD THE LOWEST SUICIDE RATE IN A DECADE WITH 10.3 SUICIDES PER
100,000 SAILORS.  THE AVERAGE RATE OF MILITARY SUICIDES HAS DECLINED
IN RECENT YEARS TO ROUGHLY 12 PER 100,000, WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY



PAGE 02 RUEWMFU1660 UNCLAS
LESS THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF OVER 19 PER 100,000.  WHILE THESE
STATISTICS ARE ENCOURAGING, WE MUST CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO
REDUCE SUICIDES IN OUR NAVY.
2.  AWARENESS OF SUICIDE RISK FACTORS AND PREVENTION RESOURCES MUST
REMAIN HIGH.  SUICIDE IS SECOND ONLY TO TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS AS THE
LEADING KILLER OF OUR SAILORS.  ALL LEVELS OF LEADERSHIP MUST GET
INVOLVED TO RECOGNIZE WHEN A SAILOR IS VULNERABLE.  EVERYONE MUST
LEARN THE WARNING SIGNS AND THE RIGHT RESPONSE.  PART OF THE CORRECT
RESPONSE IS TO ALERT THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.
3.  WE MUST DISCARD THE MISCONCEPTIONS REGARDING SUICIDE, SUCH AS
PEOPLE WHO THREATEN SUICIDE WILL NOT ACT.  ALMOST EVERYONE WHO
ATTEMPTS SUICIDE HAS GIVEN SOME SORT OF CLUE OR INDICATION.  THE
TOPIC IS NOT TABOO--BRING THE SUBJECT UP FOR DISCUSSION AND DISCUSS
IT OPENLY.  ANOTHER COMMON MYTH IS SUICIDES INCREASE DURING THE
HOLIDAY SEASON.  THE FACTS SHOW THE SUICIDE RATE IS FAIRLY
CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, DESPITE THE INCREASED ATTENTION
DURING THE HOLIDAYS.
4.  A SUPPORT NETWORK OF EMERGENCY CARE CENTERS, MENTAL HEALTH
CLINICS, SUBSTANCE ABUSE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS, FLEET AND FAMILY
SUPPORT CENTERS, AND MILITARY CHAPLAINS OR CIVILIAN CLERGY ARE



PAGE 03 RUEWMFU1660 UNCLAS
TRAINED AND READY TO HELP.  THE NAVY SUICIDE PREVENTION VIDEO
"SUICIDE AWARENESS:  MAKING THE CRITICAL DECISION AND SUICIDE
PREVENTION" IS INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL MILITARY TRAINING PROGRAM.
COPIES CAN BE ORDERED FROM THE DEFENSE VISUAL INFORMATION CENTER AT
DODIMAGERY.AFIS.OSD.MIL.
5.  OUTSTANDING INFORMATION ON SUICIDE PREVENTION, INCLUDING
RESOURCES SUCH AS TRAINING, WEB LINKS, AND THE NAVY LEADERS GUIDE
ON MANAGING PERSONNEL IN DISTRESS CAN BE OBTAINED AT
WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/COMMANDSUPPORT/SUICIDEPREVENTION/.
ADDITIONALLY, THE NAVY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CENTER (NEHC) HAS
SUICIDE PREVENTION INFORMATION AT WWW-NEHC.MED.NAVY.MIL/HP/SUICIDE
AND THE MARINE CORPS HAS SUICIDE PREVENTION INFORMATION AT
WWW.USMC-MCCS.ORG/FMILITARYLIFEHOME.CFM.
6.  MENTAL HEALTH IS AN INTRINSIC PART OF THE OVERALL HEALTH AND
WELLNESS OF OUR SAILORS.  SUICIDES HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT ON THE
READINESS AND MORALE OF A UNIT.  COMMANDING OFFICERS MUST CONTINUE
TO PROVIDE TRAINING ON SUICIDE PREVENTION, AT LEAST ANNUALLY, AND
HAVE A LOCAL PLAN FOR MANAGING INDIVIDUALS WHO PRESENT SUICIDAL
IDEATIONS, INTENTS, OR PLANS.  ABOVE ALL, THE KEY TO PREVENTING
SUICIDE REMAINS SAILORS LOOKING OUT FOR SAILORS.
