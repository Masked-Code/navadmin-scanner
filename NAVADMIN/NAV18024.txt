recognizes commands engaged in exemplary voluntary community service 
activities that promote good stewardship of environmental resources.

6.  Our relationships with the communities in which we live and work are an 
essential piece of the Navys mission readiness.  Without the support of those 
local communities, our ability to service our warfighting platforms, maintain 
safe and healthy infrastructure for our workforce, and even deploy assets on 
time can suffer.  The Environmental Stewardship Flagship program recognizes 
commands who are fortifying those vital relationships through volunteer 
efforts that protect and restore the natural environment we all share.  
Congratulations to the winners and honorable mentions on these 
accomplishments.
