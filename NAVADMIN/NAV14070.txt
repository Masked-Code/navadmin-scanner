AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1752.2B, FAMILY ADVOCACY PROGRAM.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES APRIL AS NATIONAL CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION 
MONTH (NCAPM).  IN 1983, CONGRESS DESIGNATED APRIL AS NCAPM RECOGNIZING THE 
NEED TO FOCUS ON STRENGTHENING OUR COMMUNITIES, SUPPORTING FAMILIES AND 
CREATING INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS DIRECTED TOWARD PREVENTING CHILD ABUSE AND 
NEGLECT WHILE PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO PARENTS AND FAMILIES AFFECTED BY 
MALTREATMENT.

2.  THE 2014 NCAPM THEME, "IT ONLY TAKES A MINUTE" REMINDS US THAT CHILDREN 
ARE FRAGILE AND THAT RESPONSIBLE, AGE-APPROPRIATE SUPERVISION IS MANDATORY.  
A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF CHILD ABUSE AND CHILD NEGLECT INCIDENTS AND 
DEATHS ARE CAUSED BY YOUNG PARENTS OR OTHER CARETAKERS DISTRACTED BY THE USE 
OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES INSTEAD OF TENDING TO THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD.  THE 2014 
CAMPAIGN HEIGHTENS AWARENESS OF THE RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTRONIC 
DISTRACTIONS, SHAKEN BABY SYNDROME AND SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME.  THIS 
YEAR'S THEME ALSO SERVES AS A REMINDER THAT ALL CHILD ABUSE AND CHILD NEGLECT 
INCIDENTS AND FATALITIES ARE PREVENTABLE WHEN HEALTHY PARENTING SKILLS ARE 
INCORPORATED INTO DAILY ROUTINES AND CHILDCARE PRACTICES.

3.  PREVENTIVE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ASSIST FAMILIES WHO MAY BE AT RISK OF 
ABUSING THEIR CHILDREN TO FIND RESOURCES, SUPPORT SYSTEMS OR COPING 
STRATEGIES THAT ALLOW THEM TO PARENT EFFECTIVELY, EVEN UNDER STRESS.  
PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE COMMAND FAMILY ADVOCACY PROGRAM COORDINATOR, NEW PARENT 
SUPPORT HOME VISITATION PROGRAM, AND CIVILIAN SOCIAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS 
ARE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO SUPPORT SERVICES.

4.  COMMANDS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO INTEGRATE SHORT, KEY LEADERSHIP 
MESSAGES INTO THEIR MONTHLY TRAINING PLANS AND PARTICIPATE IN NCAPM EVENTS 
SPONSORED BY THEIR LOCAL FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTER (FFSC).  TO 
FACILITATE DELIVERY OF NCAPM MESSAGING AND OBTAIN EVENT MATERIALS, INCLUDING 
DISCUSSION SCRIPTS, LEADERSHIP VIDEOS, EVENT PLANNING MATERIALS, AND PLAN OF 
THE DAY/PLAN OF THE WEEK NOTES, CONTACT YOUR LOCAL FFSC FAMILY ADVOCACY 
PROGRAM MANAGER.
