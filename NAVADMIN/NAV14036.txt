SUBJ/NAVAL POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL (NPS) RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS FAIR 14-1.// 

RMKS/1. This message announces that NPS will host a Naval Research 
Requirements Fair 3 - 5 March 2014 on the Monterey campus. The fair serves as 
a forum for Navy and Marine organizations to communicate, review, validate, 
and recommend topics for NPS research in FY-15. Attendees with research 
requirements will be asked to present a 15 minute briefing to faculty and 
students summarizing the topic, the benefit to the Navy or Marine Corps, and 
expected products from the research.

2. This is an excellent opportunity for the Navy and Marine Corps to 
effectively leverage NPS faculty expertise and student operational experience 
as a valuable research asset. All faculty and students are invited and 
encouraged to participate in the fair.

3. Travel, billeting costs, and other arrangements associated with this fair 
will be the individual unit's responsibility.
