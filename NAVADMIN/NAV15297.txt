4.  Cybersecurity accreditation strategy for applications listed in paragraph 3 are as follows:
    a.  Applications with authorization termination date (ATD) after 30 September 2016:  
Continue activities in accordance with the Navy Data Center and Application Optimization 
(DCAO) program management office to update current record in Enterprise Mission 
Assurance Support(eMASS) to reflect the new environment and migrate on schedule.  
Renew full accreditation (preferably using risk management framework process as 
determined by the systems Echelon II) prior to existing ATD.
    b.  Applications with ATD of 30 September 2016 or earlier:  DCAO shall coordinate with 
applicable Echelon II information system owners (ISO) to trigger the eMASS record to the 
appropriate step for U.S. Fleet Cyber Command Navy Authorizing Offical (NAO) issuance of 
a High Risk Interim Authorization
to Operate (IATO).
    c.  Applications that are not registered in the Navy instance of eMASS and have no 
Cybersecurity accreditation on record:  DCAO shall coordinate with applicable Echelon II ISO 
to register affected systems in eMASS and trigger the eMASS record to the appropriate step 
for NAO issuance of a High Risk IATO.
    d.  The DCAO Program Management Office will provide a consolidated list from sub-
paragraphs b and c to the NAO, and the NAO will present a single high risk escalation brief 
for approval.  FY-16 consolidation baseline changes will be reflected in an updated 
NAVADMIN.
    e.  Upon completion of the high risk escalation process and with proper approval, the 
NAO will issue an IATO with ATD of 15 October 2016.
    f.  In all transition cases, upon completion of data center migration, the DCAO will 
coordinate with the Echelon II ISO to initiate the denial of ATO process for the legacy 
version of the application.

5.  This message has been coordinated with U.S. Fleet Cyber Command and Space and 
Naval Warfare Systems Command.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until 30 September 
2016.
