RMKS/1.  IN ORDER TO BETTER POSITION OURSELVES IN AN EVER CHANGING ECONOMY, IT 
IS IMPERATIVE THAT COMMANDS CREATE A CULTURE THAT ENCOURAGES SAVINGS AND 
FINANCIAL READINESS.  MILITARY SAVES WEEK, ESTABLISHED AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF 
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) PERSONAL FINANCIAL READINESS CAMPAIGN, 
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMANDERS TO PROMOTE TRAINING AND INFORMATION 
SEMINARS FOR SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.  THIS SOCIAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN 
IS DESIGNED TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR BY EDUCATING OUR PERSONNEL ON HOW TO ACHIEVE 
LONG-TERM FINANCIAL FITNESS.

2.  THE WEEK OF 20-27 FEB 2011 HAS BEEN SET ASIDE TO ENCOURAGE, MOTIVATE AND 
EDUCATE SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO INCREASE PERSONAL SAVINGS, DECREASE 
DEBT, AND DEVELOP FINANCIAL FITNESS HABITS THAT LEAD TO PERSONAL AS WELL AS 
OVERALL UNIT MISSION READINESS.

3.  THE MILITARY SAVES CAMPAIGN, DEVELOPED THROUGH A COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT 
BETWEEN DOD AND THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA (CFA), ENCOURAGES 
LEADERSHIP TO PROMOTE WEALTH BUILDING MESSAGES AND CONDUCT UNIT LEVEL 
CAMPAIGNS AND EVENTS FOR A MULTITUDE OF FINANCIAL PROGRAMS.

4.  THE MILITARY SAVES CAMPAIGN IS A COMMAND INITIATIVE IN WHICH LEADERSHIP 
CAN PARTNER WITH THE COMMAND FINANCIAL SPECIALIST, PERSONAL FINANCIAL 
MANAGEMENT (PFM) PROFESSIONAL, THE FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTER ALONG WITH 
OTHER KEY COMMAND LEADERS IN COORDINATING EDUCATIONAL EVENTS, WORKSHOPS AND 
OTHER CREATIVE ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION.

5.  COMMANDS SHOULD FULLY UTILIZE LOCAL RESOURCES (PUBLIC AFFAIRS, FLEET AND 
FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS, WARFIGHTER AND FAMILY SERVICE CENTERS, THE 
INSTALLATION BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS, CHILD AND YOUTH PROGRAMS, SENIOR 
ENLISTED ADVISORS, SPOUSE ORGANIZATIONS, MILITARY BANKING AND CREDIT UNION 
LIAISON OFFICERS AND THE INSTALLATION RELIEF SOCIETY) IN EVENT PLANNING.

6.  FOR MILITARY SAVES WEEK 2011, A SPECIAL EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED ON OUR 
MILITARY CHILDREN AND YOUTH.  AS SUCH, INSTALLATIONS ACROSS THE NATION ARE 
ENCOURAGED TO PARTNER WITH CHILD AND YOUTH PROGRAMS, SCHOOLS AND FLEET AND 
FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS TO ORGANIZE FUN EVENTS AND EDUCATIONAL FORUMS.  IN 
ADDITION, INSTALLATION BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS MAY OFFER SPECIAL INCENTIVES 
FOR OPENING AND/OR MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO A SAVINGS ACCOUNT.

7.  FINANCIAL READINESS STARTS WITH MAKING A COMMITMENT, SETTING A FINANCIAL 
GOAL AND WORKING TOWARD ACHIEVING THAT GOAL.  SAILORS AND FAMILY MEMBERS CAN 
BECOME MILITARY SAVERS BY MAKING A PERSONAL COMMITMENT, DEVELOPING A SAVINGS 
PLAN AND UTILIZING FINANCIAL EDUCATION SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH FLEET AND 
FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS OR WARFIGHTER AND FAMILY SERVICE CENTERS.  COMMANDERS 
ARE ENCOURAGED TO PROMOTE MAXIMUM UTILIZATION OF MILITARY SAVES EVENTS.
