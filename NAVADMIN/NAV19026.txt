RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the Spring FY-19 Full-Time 
Support (FTS) Officer Transfer and Redesignation Board on
1 April 2019.  Applications from qualified active component (AC) and Ready 
Reserve officers will be considered by this board.  In line with reference 
(a), this board will also accept applications from FTS officers requesting 
redesignation into another FTS officer community.

2.  Application requirements and procedures are provided on the FTS 
redesignation board website at https://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/communitymanagers/reserve/fts/Pages/FTSRedesignationBoar
d.aspx.  Complete application packages and waiver requests must be received 
no later than 1 March 2019.  All correspondence (e.g., awards or FITREPs) 
must be received no later than 2359 on
22 March 2019 to be considered for the board.

3.  Eligibility.
    a.  All applicants must meet eligibility requirements outlined in 
reference (a) and the spring FY-19 FTS eligibility criteria document found on 
the redesignation website.  Specific eligibility requirements are described 
for each designator and aviation community.  General eligibility criteria 
include projected rotation date (PRD), minimum service requirement (MSR), 
year group (YG) and aviation bonus (AvB)/ aviation career continuation pay 
(ACCP) contracts.
        (1) PRD.  Applicants must have a PRD no later than October 2020.
        (2) MSR.  Non-aviation applicants must complete their MSR prior to 31 
October 2020.  All aviation applicants (13X0) with an MSR prior to 30 April 
2020 may apply, aviators executing second sea tour orders may apply if their 
MSR is completed prior to
31 October 2020.
        (3) AvB/ACCP.  Aviation officers with obligated service as a result 
of AvB/ACCP are eligible to apply if the officer will be within 12 months of 
completing AvB/ACCP obligation or department head tour at the time the board 
convenes.  Redesignation immediately following a department head tour may 
result in cancellation of AvB, which will be adjudicated by Aviation Officer 
Assignments Division (PERS-43).
        (4) Failure of Selection (FOS).  AC officers in a 2xFOS status for 
promotion to LCDR are eligible to apply for FTS regardless of MSR and 
AvB/ACCP contract term, a waiver request is not required.
