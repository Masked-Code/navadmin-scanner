RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces convening of the November 2017 Active Duty 
Officer Lateral Transfer/Redesignation Board.  The lateral transfer and 
redesignation process is a key tool by which Navy manages the talents of its 
officers.  It provides flexibility in officer community manning and improves 
the Navys return on investment in officer training and education by 
leveraging the specialized skillsets of officers throughout their careers.  
As part of the process, applications from qualified Unrestricted Line, 
Restricted Line (RL), Staff Corps, and Limited Duty Officers (LDO) are now 
being accepted for the Active Duty Officer Lateral Transfer/ Redesignation 
Board which convenes 6 November 2017.  Full-Time Support (FTS) and Selected 
Reserve (SELRES) officers are not eligible to apply for this board.

2.  In addition to the year group (YG) limitations imposed in paragraph 6, 
applicants must also meet eligibility requirements detailed in references (a) 
through (c), and are required to review and comply with any additional 
community requirements found in the November 2017 Letter of Instruction 
located at:
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/boards/administrative/
transferredesignation/pages/status.aspx.
    a.  Officers who do not meet eligibility requirements per references (a) 
through (c) such as time-in-grade (TIG), years-of- commissioned service 
(YCS), or time-in-service must submit a waiver request in addition to or in 
conjunction with their lateral transfer/redesignation application as 
specified by specific communities.
    b.  A waiver request must include officers waiver request letter and

7.  Notes:
    a.  Must have Surface Warfare Officer (SWO) qualification completed to 
apply for transfer.  Officers under SWO Continuation Pay, Revised Junior 
Critical Skills Retention Bonus, SWO Lieutenant Commander (LCDR) Retention 
Bonus or Department Head (DH) Retention Bonus (DHRB) contract are not 
eligible for transfer until completion of bonus obligation.  SWOs serving 
under an agreement for any of the SWO bonuses are eligible to apply to the 
board if the board convening date is within 1 year of satisfaction of the 
full bonus obligation.  Quotas out may be limited due to manning levels for 
any given YG, community billet requirements, the status of DH contract goals 
for YGs with less than 6 YCS, and the individual officers assignment status.  
Officers within their detailing window must communicate with their detailer 
prior to submitting a lateral transfer application.  Executing orders, 
slating to a billet, or serving in a hard fill billet or one with significant 
training required could disqualify an officer for consideration and release 
from the community until arrival to the next duty station or upon completion 
of a minimum activity tour.  Requests for lateral transfer out of the SWO 
community from LCDR and above will be considered on a case-by-case basis due 
to shortages in these grades.
    b.  Waivers to the requirements of paragraph 4h of reference (b) for 
nuclear-trained Surface and Submarine Warfare Officers may be considered on a 
case-by-case basis.
    c.  Officers commissioned under a still-valid SWO-option agreement 
(Engineering Duty (ED), Intelligence (INTEL), Information Professional (IP), 
Cryptologic Warfare (CW), Oceanography (OCEANO)) must contact their 
respective RL option community manager regarding desire to be released from 
the SWO-option agreement and seek lateral transfer to a different community.
    d.  Nuclear-trained SWOs YG 12 and senior are available for lateral 
transfer consideration.
    e.  Officers screened "not cleared" for their next career milestone are 
eligible.
    f.  The YG range provided displays possible opportunities.
Contact your specific community placement officer with questions regarding 
quota availability for each Type/Model/Series/YG.  General Aviation Officers 
(1300) are eligible to apply for lateral transfer regardless of Active Duty 
Service Obligation (ADSO) from winging.
Aviation Officers (131X and 132X) are eligible to apply for lateral transfer 
if the officer has fulfilled ADSO, or will be within 12 months of completing 
ADSO at the time the board convenes.  Aviation Officers with obligated 
service as a result of Aviation Career Continuation Pay (ACCP) are eligible 
to apply if the officer will be within 12 months of completing ACCP 
obligation at the time the board convenes.  Additionally, Aviation Officers 
with obligated service as a result of ACCP are eligible to apply if the 
officer will be within
12 months of department head tour projected rotation date (PRD) at the time 
the board convenes, regardless of contrary ACCP contract language.  
Redesignation immediately following department head tour may result in 
cancellation of ACCP, which will be adjudicated by PERS-43.  Aviation 
Lieutenants (LT) in a failure of selection (FOS) status to LCDR are eligible 
to apply regardless of ADSO or ACCP obligation.  Graduates from U.S. Naval 
Test Pilot School class 149 and 150 may apply for AEDO only, regardless of 
ADSO (contact AEDO Officer Community Manager (OCM) for details).  If 
selected, Aviation Officers should not expect to redesignate until completion 
of ADSO, fulfillment/expiration/cancellation of ACCP contract, or PRD, as 
determined by Aviation OCM (BUPERS-313).  Officers selected to AEDO should 
expect to redesignate immediately.  Aviation Officers in operational flying 
billets (billet designator XXX1 or XXX2) will not be permitted to redesignate 
until vacating the billet, typically at PRD.  BUPERS-313 authorizes 
redesignation timing.  By accepting a lateral transfer out of Aviation (13XX) 
an officer consents to voluntary termination of flight status (except for 
AEDO selects) effective the date of redesignation with the Lateral Transfer 
Application and CO endorsement fulfilling the requirements set forth in 
reference (h).
    g.  ED Community
        (1) Applicants desiring out quota from ED:
            (a) ED out quotas are extremely limited.  Redesignation requests 
must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis with careful consideration given to 
impact on overall community health.
            (b) Applicants must have fulfilled at least 24 months of their 
postgraduate education payback tour in order to apply.
        (2) Applicants desiring redesignation to ED:
            (a) Officers without a warfare qualification are expected to 
submit an application for the ED Dolphin Program in line with reference (i).
            (b) Applicants from YGs 15-12 (paragraph 6C) are desired.  YG 11-
08 inventory requirements are met and not open for redesignation on this 
board.  Applicants from YG 07 are desired if applicants are currently 
enrolled in or have completed an approved Masters Degree.  See MILPERSMAN 
1212-040 for a list of approved degrees and corresponding subspecialty codes.
    h.  Civil Engineer Corps (CEC) Officers under CEC Critical Skills 
Retention Bonus (CSRB) contract are eligible to apply to the board if the 
board application due date is within 1 year of satisfaction of the full bonus 
obligation.  Officers with more than one year of obligation remaining on 
their CEC CSRB contract may submit a waiver to be released prior to 
fulfillment of their bonus obligation.  Waivers must be submitted to the CEC 
OCM for review on a case-by-case basis and can be submitted with the 
application.  If approved, the notice of approval for early release from the 
CSRB contract must be included with the lateral transfer application.
Release from the CSRB contract will be considered a voluntary release subject 
to repayment of any unearned amount.
    i.  LDO redesignation requests will be reviewed on a case-by- case basis, 
considering impact to overall community health.  Nuclear LDO submissions will 
not be considered.  All other designators must have completed 4 YCS and 
accepted permanent LDO appointment to LT prior to lateral 
transfer/redesignation.  LDO out quotas are extremely limited but special 
consideration will be given to officers projected to be statutorily separated 
for years of service prior to attaining the rank of Commander.  Information 
Warfare Community applicants in YGs 12 and senior will receive favorable 
consideration.
    j.  Officers YG 13 and senior seeking lateral transfer into the Surface 
Warfare Community are strongly encouraged to contact the SWO OCM prior to 
applying in order to discuss critical SWO career milestone requirements.
    k.  Naval Special Warfare (NSW) will no longer consider or select lateral 
transfers via this board.  All applicants will be considered by a separate 
NSW selection process and must submit their application directly to the SEAL 
OCM.  More information, including required application contents and 
submission due dates, can be found on the SEAL OCM website:  
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/
officer/communitymanagers/unrestricted/nsw/pages/
sealofficerselection.aspx.
    l.  EOD LDOs (6480) in YGs 03-06 will be considered for lateral transfer 
and redesignation as an EOD Officer (1140).
    m.  Officers in all eligible YGs with Operations Analysis (OA) 
subspecialty (321X) and/or those with an Academic Profile Code (APC) of 325 
or better are encouraged to apply to Human Resources (HR).
    n.  YG 15 has highest anticipated inventory requirement.
Inventory requirements for YG 08 are met.  However, the HR Community is 
targeting increased inventory for OA subspecialists.  YG 08 applicants with 
321X subspecialty from completed graduate education and/or experience tours 
are planned for referral to board.  This is the last planned opportunity for 
YG 06 applicants for lateral transfer.
    o.  HR applicants without a Masters degree resulting in 3XXX 
subspecialty, must request to have their APC calculated by Naval Postgraduate 
School prior to board convening date (apply online:
https://my.nps.edu/web/admissions/apply).  Applicants without an APC by 
application suspense must include a copy of their undergraduate transcript 
with their application.
    p.  Officers who are one time FOS for LCDR will not be considered for 
lateral transfer to 1510.  Aviation Officers (13XX) are eligible and may 
apply for 1510 (only) regardless of ADSO if they are a graduate of U.S. Naval 
Test Pilot School class 149 or class 150.
    q.  Officers are strongly encouraged to contact the Aerospace Maintenance 
Duty OCM to discuss milestones and qualifications commensurate with YG.
    r.  All Foreign Area Officers (FAO) must be eligible for TS/SCI security 
clearance, submit a Personnel Security Questionnaire (SF-
86) in line with reference (g), or include a letter from a Special Security 
Officer (SSO) indicating successful completion of an SCI pre-screening 
interview (SSO letter is preferred).  All FAO applicants must be worldwide 
assignable.  Worldwide assignability must be verified and documented via 
successful overseas screening to U.S. Naval Forces Central Command standards 
(e.g., Bahrain), to include all dependents, using Medical and Dental Overseas 
Screening Review for Active Duty or Dependent (NAVMED form 1300/1) and Report 
of Suitability for Overseas Assignment (NAVPERS 1300/16) Parts I and II 
(valid 365 days from the date of signature).  Candidates should have their 
language abilities documented by a recent (taken after June 2014) Defense 
Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) and (if
possible) oral proficiency interview (OPI).
        (1) DLPT/OPI level 2 or higher is a qualifying score but is not 
required for applicants of YG 07 and junior.  A minimum Defense Language 
Aptitude Battery (DLAB) score of 95 is required, and a score greater than 110 
is highly desirable.  A DLAB score never expires.  There is no need to retake 
the exam if a desired score is attained.
        (2) Officers without a regionally-focused Masters degree should have 
an APC of 265 or better, or an undergraduate grade point average of at least 
2.60.  If they do not meet this requirement a waiver can be requested by 
submitting an enclosure in the application.
        (3) The following paragraphs provide rank and YG specific information 
for officers considering lateral transfer/redesignation to FAO:
            (a) LT and LCDR(sel) - Applicants in YG 12-07 are desired.
