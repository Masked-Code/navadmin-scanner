SUBJ/NAVY INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY (CORRECTED COPY)//

RMKS/1.  I hope you have had the opportunity to view my second video, It Starts with Us, encouraging a 
dialogue about race relations and inclusion within the Navy.  We have been working to build a better 
Navy through the Culture of Excellence approach announced in references (a) and (b).  One very 
important aspect of this approach is recognizing that we come from all walks of life, with different and 
valuable experiences and perspectives.  Our differences make our Navy, our connection to each other 
and our families and communities even stronger.

2.  Our efforts are taking us in the right direction, but clearly not enough has been done to face the 
challenges of today.  Three weeks ago, I asked you to listen.  Now, I am strongly encouraging every Navy 
leader  uniform and civilian, active and reserve - to start a dialogue at each of your commands.  As a 
Navy, we must seize this opportunity to engage in conversations about race relations and inclusion 
within our force. Now is the time to have open and honest conversations across our Navy.  We need to 
identify what is really happening, understand where barriers exist and listen to all perspectives on how 
we can bring our unique skillsets together to tackle these issues.  This is not the problem of one group of 
people.  This is our Navy, and we need a greater understanding of the experiences that make us One 
Navy Team and build trust and connection in our teams.

3.  In addition to these conversations at every command and at every level, we are standing up Task 
Force (TF) One Navy reflecting the diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, age, and ranks from across our 
Navy to identify barriers and corrective actions to eliminate inequalities between groups of people.  TF 
One Navy will leverage outreach focus groups from both within and outside the Navy representing 
diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, age, and rank to ensure a diversity of experience and perspectives.  
Additionally, in line with reference (c), the Secretary of Defense is setting up a Department of Defense 
(DoD) Board on Diversity and Inclusion to address DoD-wide issues of diversity, equity, inclusion and 
belonging within the DoD.  While we have been committed to Inclusion and Diversity for many years, 
current events shine a light on the need for us to do more and to do it more quickly.

4.  At the command level, we need to:
    a.  Start a dialogue with your superiors, peers and teams and listen to their personal stories and 
experiences.  If we have not directly experienced racism, sexism, ageism, or other forms of 
discrimination, it is often difficult to realize they exist.
However, they do exist in our Navy and country, and it is our responsibility to eliminate them.
    b.  Keep the conversation going.  Practice inclusion every day by integrating Sailor and civilian 
perspectives in early stages of problem-solving and idea generation.  In each meeting you have and 
problem you tackle, include all perspectives to gather varied points of view that will help you make the 
best decision.
    c.  Leverage your Command Resilience Team to understand what is happening in your command.  
Look at your most recent command climate assessment with fresh eyes.  Surveys may show you some of 
the problem areas in your command that you can address in your conversations.
    d.  Advocate and model the leadership style that motivates people to speak up, be empathetic 
listeners, stand up for each other, learn and grow.  Ensure doors are open for conversations and 
opportunities are available for professional development throughout the command.
    e.  Share lessons learned and best practices on leveraging diverse populations with your or your upper 
echelons designated Inclusion and Diversity Representative.
    f.  Increase your knowledge and awareness of Inclusion and Diversity Heritage Celebrations and 
Special Observances by supporting programs, exhibits, publications and participation in community 
military and civilian sponsored events throughout the year.

5.  I need every Sailor to:
    a.  Speak up and share your experiences about what you and your families are feeling, what you think 
the major issues are and how you would fix it if you were in charge.  Identify areas where there are 
barriers to certain groups of people in the Navy feeling like they truly belong on the team.  Have pride in 
being an integral part of the greatest Navy in the world and have confidence that we will continue to 
lead on issues that impact all of us.
    b.  Be an ally for those who do not feel like they can speak up.
Listen to and understand others lived experiences and recognize that your perspective is one of many 
valuable perspectives.
    c.  Live the Signature Behaviors 24/7/365 delineated in reference (d).  These behaviors include:
          (1) Treat every person with respect.
          (2) Take responsibility for my actions.
          (3) Hold others accountable for their actions.
          (4) Intervene when necessary.
          (5) Be a leader and encourage leadership in others.
          (6) Grow personally and professionally every day.
          (7) Embrace the diversity of ideas, experiences and backgrounds of individuals.
          (8) Uphold the highest degree of integrity in professional and personal life.
          (9) Exercise discipline in conduct and performance.
          (10) Contribute to team success through actions and attitude.

6.  As Sailors, and as a Navy, we cannot tolerate racism or discrimination of any kind.  We must listen to 
each other, understand the perspectives of others and identify and eliminate individual and systemic 
racism and discrimination within our force.
We must live the Signature Behaviors and the first step is having conversations with one another, 
controlling what you and I can control and make recommendations to leadership on other changes to 
help effect positive change.
