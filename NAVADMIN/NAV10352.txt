SUBJ/PERFORM TO SERVE - FLEET RATING IDENTIFICATION ENGINE INTEGRATION 
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES// 

RMKS/1.  AS OF 29 SEPTEMBER 2010, THE PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) SYSTEM HAS BEEN 
MERGED INTO THE FLEET RATING IDENTIFICATION ENGINE (FLEET
RIDE) PROGRAM TO PROVIDE A UNIFIED APPLICATION PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR SAILOR 
CAREER MANAGEMENT.  THE NEW PTS/FLEET RIDE PROGRAM IS A VITAL TOOL IN 
SUPPORTING OUR TOTAL FORCE STRATEGY AND PROVIDES A MEANS TO RETAIN OUR BEST 
AND BRIGHTEST SAILORS IN ORDER TO MEET CURRENT AND FUTURE FLEET MANPOWER 
REQUIREMENTS.  THIS NAVADMIN DESCRIBES INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PTS/FLEET 
RIDE SYSTEM, SPECIFIC POLICY CHANGES, PTS ALGORITM CHANGES, PROCEDURES FOR 
APPLICATION SUBMISSION, AND POINTS OF CONTACT FOR RESOLVING QUESTIONS AND 
CONCERNS.

2.  IMPLEMENTATION.
    A.  AS OF 29 SEPTEMBER 2010, THE FORMER PTS SYSTEM IS NO
    LONGER OPERATIONAL.  AUGUST PTS RESULTS HAVE BEEN RELEASED; DUE TO THE 
SYSTEM TRANSITION THERE WAS NO PTS CYCLE FOR SEPTEMBER (APPLICATIONS WERE NOT 
ACCEPTED).
    B.  SAILORS WHO WOULD HAVE HAD FINAL PTS REVIEW IN SEPTEMBER RECEIVE THEIR 
FINAL LOOK IN OCTOBER.  COMMANDS SHOULD REVIEW THE APPLICATIONS IN FLEET RIDE 
TO ENSURE THESE SAILORS HAVE AN UP TO DATE APPLICATION FOR THEIR REMAINING 
REVIEW.

3.  POLICY CHANGES COINCIDENT TO PTS/FLEET RIDE INTEGRATION.  THE FOLLOWING 
CHANGES TO THE PTS PROGRAM ARE EFFECTIVE 1 OCTOBER 2010:
    A.  COMMANDS SHALL ENSURE PTS APPLICATIONS ARE SUBMITTED FOR
    ALL DESIGNATED E3-E6 SAILORS WITH LESS THAN 14 YEARS OF SERVICE AS EARLY 
AS 15 MONTHS PRIOR TO, BUT NO LATER THAN 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THEIR END OF 
ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE (EAOS) AS EXTENDED, ALSO KNOWN AS "SOFT" EAOS 
(SEAOS).  DURING THIS MANDATORY SUBMISSION PERIOD, APPLICATIONS MUST BE 
SUBMITTED EVEN IF THE SAILOR'S INTENTION IS TO SEPARATE, OR IF THE SAILOR IS 
INELIGIBLE OR NOT RECOMMENDED FOR REENLISTMENT AT THE TIME OF APPLICATION.
    B.  SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE APPLICATIONS MAY BE SUBMITTED REGARDLESS OF 
SEAOS, BASED ON PRD FOR SAILORS REQUIRING TO OBLISERV FOR ORDERS, END OF 
ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE (EAOS) FOR SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS (SRB), OR 
OTHER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRING ADDITIONAL OBLIGATED SERVICE.
    C.  PTS QUOTA APPROVALS WILL BE GRANTED AFTER THE MONTHLY
    RACK AND STACK AND FINAL REVIEW.  ONCE ADDITIONAL OBLIGATED SERVICE IS 
INCURRED FOR AN APPROVED PTS APPLICATION, OR A PERIOD OF 13 MONTHS PASSES 
SINCE THE QUOTA WAS ISSUED, THE PTS QUOTA IS CONSIDERED EXPIRED AND IS NO 
LONGER VALID.  ONCE A QUOTA IS EXPIRED, THE SAILOR WILL HAVE TO REAPPLY.
        (1) PTS QUOTAS ISSUED PRIOR TO 1 OCTOBER 2009 ARE
        CONSIDERED VALID UNTIL 01 MAR 2011.  CAREER COUNSELORS/COMMANDS ARE 
REQUIRED TO OBTAIN ENLISTED COMMUNITY MANAGER CONCURRENCE PRIOR TO USING 
QUOTAS ISSUED BEFORE 1 OCTOBER 2009.
    D.  PTS APPROVAL IS NOT NECESSARY FOR EXTENSIONS IF REQUESTS MEET ALL 
REQUIREMENTS OF THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTS:

        (2) NAVADMIN 242-09 - MODIFICATION OF OBLIGATED
        SERVICE AND EXTENSION POLICY

        (4) SAILOR IS NOT WITHIN 12 MONTHS OF SEAOS

PERMANENT DUTY STATION UPON REENTRY TO MILITARY SERVICE.
