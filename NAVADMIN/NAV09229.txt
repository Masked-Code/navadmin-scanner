RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NAVY'S CAREER

INITIATIVES DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT THE NAVY'S CONTINUUM OF SERVICE (COS), 
PROVIDING SAILORS A SEAMLESS TRANSITION BETWEEN ACTIVE AND RESERVE 
COMPONENTS (AC/RC) AND ENCOURAGING A LIFETIME OF SERVICE.  
PER REF A, THE OVERALL GOALS OF THE CTO ARE TO SUPPORT OPTIMIZED 
ASSIGNMENT OF PERSONNEL INTO AVAILABLE NAVY ACTIVE AND RESERVE 
BILLETS, DECREASE TRANSITION PROCESSING TIMES AND ERROR RATES, AND 
INCREASE RESERVE SAILOR TRANSITION/AFFILIATION RATES.

RESERVE COMPONENT.  IF AN OFFICER HAS AN APPROVED 
SEPARATION/TRANSITION REQUEST AND HAS BEEN CONTACTED BY A NAVY 
RECRUITER, THEY WILL NOT BE IMPACTED BY THE CTO AND WILL CONTINUE THEIR 
TRANSITION USING NAVY RECRUITING.  OFFICERS BEING PROCESSED FOR 
TRANSITION BY THE CTO CAN EXPECT THE FOLLOWING:
        (1) DIRECT CONTACT FROM A CTO TRANSITION ASSISTANT (TA) 
WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF APPROVAL FOR SEPARATION BY PERS-8.
        (2) INFORMATION CONCERNING RESERVE PROGRAM OPPORTUNITIES 
PROVIDED THROUGH DIRECT COUNSELING AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA.
        (3) ASSISTANCE IN PREPARING TRANSITION/AFFILIATION DOCUMENTS.

        (5) ASSISTANCE IN SELECTING AND OBTAINING A RESERVE UNIT BILLET.
        (6) ASSIGNMENT OF A SPONSOR FROM THEIR SELECTED NAVY 
OPERATIONAL SUPPORT CENTER (NOSC)/RESERVE UNIT.
        (7) ASSISTANCE WITH PAY AND PERSONNEL SYSTEMS.
        (8) CONTINUED CONTACT WITH THEIR TA UNTIL THEY HAVE 
AFFILIATED WITH THE NAVY RESERVE AND HAVE BEEN PAID.
