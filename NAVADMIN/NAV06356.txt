SUBJ/WISHING YOU A JOYOUS SEASON// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  I WISH ALL OF YOU IN OUR NAVY THE VERY BEST THIS 
HOLIDAY SEASON.  WHETHER IT FINDS YOU OVERSEAS OR AT HOME, AT SEA OR 
ASHORE, PLEASE KNOW THAT I - AND EVERY OTHER AMERICAN - DEEPLY 
APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE AND THAT OF YOUR FAMILIES DURING THIS CRITICAL 
TIME IN OUR NATION S HISTORY.
2.  WE KNOW IT IS NOT EASY DEFENDING OUR WAY OF LIFE - THAT IT IS NOT 
EASY TO WORK SO HARD TO ENSURE THAT SO MANY OTHERS MAY LIVE IN FREEDOM.  
IT REQUIRES SACRIFICE AND A SPECIAL DETERMINATION.  IT REQUIRES 
TEAMWORK AND SELFLESSNESS.  SHOULDER-TO-SHOULDER WITH YOUR COUNTERPARTS 
IN THE JOINT FORCE, YOU STAND UP FOR LIBERTY, DIGNITY, AND TOLERANCE 
AGAINST ENEMIES WHO STAND FOR NOTHING BUT HATE, FEAR, AND TYRANNY.  
EVERYTHING WE CELEBRATE DURING THE HOLIDAYS IS EVERYTHING YOU REPRESENT.
3.  IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE THOUSANDS WHO MUST SPEND THE SEASON AWAY FROM 
YOUR LOVED ONES, PLEASE STAY SAFE AND FOCUSED.  IF YOU ARE FORTUNATE 
ENOUGH TO SPEND THE HOLIDAYS AT HOME WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS, PLEASE 
TRAVEL SAFELY AND TAKE TIME TO APPRECIATE ALL THAT FAMILY AND 
TOGETHERNESS TRULY MEAN.
4.  WHEREVER YOU ARE, PLEASE ALSO TAKE TIME TO REMEMBER THE VALUES YOU 
HOLD DEAR, THE PEOPLE YOU HELP DEFEND, AND THE MANY TABLES AT WHICH - 
THROUGH FATE AND TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCES - THERE WILL BE ONE LESS PLACE 
SET THIS YEAR.  YOUR SERVICE MATTERS.  IT IS THE GREATEST GIFT YOU GIVE 
A GRATEFUL NATION.  FROM MY FAMILY TO YOURS, THANK YOU AND HAPPY 
HOLIDAYS.
