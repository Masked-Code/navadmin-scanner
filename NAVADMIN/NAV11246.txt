SUBJ/OBSERVANCE OF WOMEN'S EQUALITY DAY 2011//

RMKS/1.  WOMEN'S EQUALITY DAY WILL BE OBSERVED ON 26 AUGUST 2011.
THIS DAY COMMEMORATES THE 1920 PASSAGE OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT TO THE 
CONSTITUTION, GRANTING WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE.

2.  THE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT BEGAN IN 1848 AT THE SENECA FALLS CONVENTION 
IN SENECA FALLS, NEW YORK, CONVENED BY SUFFRAGIST LEADERS ELIZABETH CADY 
STANTON AND LUCRETIA MOTT.  THE RESULTING

DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS, WHICH OUTLINED KEY SOCIAL, CIVIL, AND POLITICAL 
DEMANDS FOR WOMEN, HELPED THE CAUSE OF WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE GAIN NATIONAL 
PROMINENCE.  NEARLY 72 YEARS OF CEASELESS CAMPAIGNING BY A COALITION OF 
SUFFRAGISTS, TEMPERANCE GROUPS, REFORM-MINDED POLITICIANS, AND WOMEN'S SOCIAL 
WELFARE ORGANIZATIONS LED TO THE PASSING OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT TO THE 
CONSTITUTION ON 26 AUGUST 1920, PROHIBITING STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES FROM 
PLACING GENDER-BASED RESTRICTIONS ON VOTING.  TO HONOR AND COMMEMORATE THIS 
HISTORIC EVENT, IN 1971 NEW YORK CONGRESSWOMAN BELLA ABZUG INTRODUCED, AND 
CONGRESS SIGNED, A RESOLUTION TO DESIGNATE AUGUST 26TH AS WOMEN'S EQUALITY DAY 
RECOGNIZING THE ANNIVERSARY OF SUFFRAGE AND OF WOMEN'S CONTINUED EFFORTS 
TOWARD EQUAL RIGHTS.

3.  TALENTED FEMALE OFFICERS, SAILORS, AND CIVILIANS ARE A KEY COMPONENT OF 
OUR TOTAL FORCE, AND THEY ARE AN INVALUABLE ASSET TO THE STRENGTH OF OUR NAVY.  
WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE WOMEN'S ARMED SERVICES INTEGRATION ACT OF 12 JUNE 
1948, WOMEN GAINED PERMANENT STATUS IN THE ARMED SERVICES.  WOMEN WERE FIRST 
ASSIGNED TO SELECTED NON-COMBATANT SHIPS IN 1978, AND OPPORTUNITIES WERE LATER 
BROADENED TO INCLUDE SERVICE IN COMBATANTS IN 1994 FOLLOWING THE REPEAL OF THE 
COMBAT EXCLUSION LAW.  MOST RECENTLY, IN APRIL 2010, THE NAVY ANNOUNCED A 
POLICY CHANGE THAT ALLOWS WOMEN TO SERVE ON SUBMARINES.

THERE ARE NEARLY 63,000 WOMEN, ACTIVE AND RESERVE, SERVING IN OUR NAVY TODAY, 
COMPRISING 16.3 PERCENT OF THE FORCE.  ADDITIONALLY, NEARLY 50,000 WOMEN SERVE 
ACROSS OUR NAVY IN A WIDE RANGE OF SPECIALTIES AS CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES.
