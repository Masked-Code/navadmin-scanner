SUBJ/OCEANOGRAPHER OF THE NAVY AWARDS PROGRAM//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES BACKGROUND, GUIDANCE, AND SOLICITS 
NOMINATIONS FOR A SET OF NEW OCEANOGRAPHER OF THE NAVY-SPONSORED AWARDS TO 
ANNUALLY RECOGNIZE MILITARY AND CIVILIAN NAVAL OCEANOGRAPHY PROFESSIONALS FOR

OCEANOGRAPHY, HYDROGRAPHY, AND PRECISE TIME AND ASTROMETRY.  THESE AWARDS ARE 
COMPARABLE TO OTHER AWARDS WITHIN THE OTHER SPECIALTIES OF THE INFORMATION

2.  AS THE FOUNDATION OF BATTLESPACE AWARENESS WITHIN INFORMATION DOMINANCE 
WARFARE, NAVAL OCEANOGRAPHY TRACES ITS ROOTS TO 6 DECEMBER 1830 WHEN THE NAVY 
ESTABLISHED THE DEPOT OF CHARTS AND INSTRUMENTS TO CORRECT DEFICIENCIES IN 
NAUTICAL CHARTS AND NAVIGATION INSTRUMENTS.  A DOZEN YEARS LATER, LT MATTHEW 
FOUNTAINE MAURY INSTITUTED THE CHANGES THAT ESTABLISHED NAVAL OCEANOGRAPHY AS 
WE KNOW IT TODAY.  MAURY WAS THE FIRST TO CHART WIND, CURRENT, AND WATER

DEVELOPED A SYSTEM TO SUPPLY SHIPS WITH ACCURATE CHARTS AND NAVIGATIONAL 
EQUIPMENT. FROM THOSE HUMBLE BEGINNINGS, NAVAL OCEANOGRAPHY, TO INCLUDE 
METEOROLOGY, OCEANOGRAPHY, HYDROGRAPHY, PRECISE TIME, AND ASTROMETRY, HAS 
BECOME ESSENTIAL TO SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FLEET OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE.
