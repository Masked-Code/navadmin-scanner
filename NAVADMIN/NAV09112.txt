SUBJ/INTEGRATION OF THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER (PAO) AND LIMITED DUTY
OFFICER (LDO) PHOTO OFFICER COMMUNITIES AND DISESTABLISHMENT OF THE 
647X DESIGNATOR.// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE INTEGRATION OF THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS
OFFICER 165X AND LDO PHOTO OFFICER 647X COMMUNITIES, AND THE
DISESTABLISHMENT OF THE 647X DESIGNATOR.  
2.  BACKGROUND
    A.  THIS ACTION IS ALIGNED WITH THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMUNITY 
STRATEGIC PLAN AND ADDRESSES REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THE QUADRENNIAL 
DEFENSE REVIEW AND CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS PRIORITY TASKING MEMO TO 
BUILD AND DELIVER MORE STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION CAPABILITY IN THE NAVY'S 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS ENTERPRISE.
    B.  IN 2007, A CHIEF OF NAVAL PERSONNEL-SPONSORED COMPREHENSIVE 
STUDY OF THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMUNITY WAS CONDUCTED TO ASSESS FLEET 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS CAPABILITIES AND CAPACITY.  THE STUDY FOUND SIGNIFICANT 
CAPABILITY GAPS RELATED TO STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION.  AMONG MANY OTHER 
INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO CLOSE THIS CAPABILITY GAP, IT WAS
RECOMMENDED THAT THE 647X DESIGNATOR BE DISESTABLISHED, AND THE 
EXISTING BILLET STRUCTURE AND OFFICERS BE CONVERTED TO THE 165X 
DESIGNATOR, SPECIAL DUTY OFFICER (PUBLIC AFFAIRS).
    C.  IN 2005, THE CHIEF OF INFORMATION ASSUMED FLAG OFFICER 
SPONSORSHIP FOR THE LDO PHOTO COMMUNITY IN ADDITION TO HIS EXISTING 
SPONSORSHIP OF THE PAO COMMUNITY.  CONSEQUENTLY, OVER THE PAST FOUR 
YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A NATURAL INTEGRATION OF THE TWO COMMUNITIES AND 
A SUBSEQUENT CONVERGENCE OF THE SKILL SETS POSSESSED BY LDO PHOTO 
OFFICERS AND PAOS.
    D.  THE CHIEF OF INFORMATION HAS IDENTIFIED VISUAL INFORMATION
(VI) AS A CRITICAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS CORE CAPABILITY.  AS SUCH,
DISESTABLISHMENT OF THE 647X DESIGNATOR AND SUBSEQUENT INTEGRATION OF 
THE PAO AND LDO PHOTO COMMUNITIES ENSURES THAT THE VI SKILL SET WILL BE 
RESIDENT MORE THAN 260 OFFICERS IN THE PA ENTERPRISE, RATHER THAN 
CONCENTRATED AMONG ONLY 46 OFFICERS IN THE 647X COMMUNITY.
3.  DETAILS
    A.  A VIABLE CAREER PATH WILL BE RETAINED FOR EVERY OFFICER 
AFFECTED, EITHER AS A PAO, LDO PHOTO OFFICER, OR IN ANOTHER DESIGNATOR, 
IF DESIRED.
    B.  BILLETS WILL BE TRANSITIONED FROM 647X TO 165X AS LDO PHOTO 
OFFICERS RETIRE OR LATERALLY TRANSFER TO 165X OR ANOTHER COMMUNITY, TO 
ENSURE OPTIMAL PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES IN EACH COMMUNITY.  
    C.  WITHIN THE LIMITS OF NAVY REGULATIONS, LDO PHOTO OFFICERS WILL 
BE TRANSITIONED INTO THE 165X DESIGNATOR TO THE GREATEST EXTENT 
POSSIBLE.  WAIVERS WILL BE REQUESTED WHERE APPLICABLE FOR LDO PHOTO 
OFFICERS WHO DO NOT HOLD DEGREES BUT WHO, IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE 
CHIEF OF INFORMATION, HAVE THE REQUISITE SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE TO 
PERFORM SUCCESSFULLY AS A 165X.
    D.  LDO PHOTO OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT ABLE OR NOT WILLING TO TRANSFER 
INTO THE 165X COMMUNITY WILL BE PERMITTED TO REMAIN IN THEIR DESIGNATOR 
UNTIL THEY RETIRE, OR RE-DESIGNATE INTO ANOTHER COMMUNITY.
    E.  CONSOLIDATED DETAILING FOR THE 647X AND 165X COMMUNITIES HAS 
BEEN IN PLACE SINCE 2005.  TO FACILITATE MERGING OF THE COMMUNITIES, 
DETAILERS WILL ASSIGN 165X TO 647X BILLETS AND VICE VERSA UNTIL ALL 
647X BILLETS ARE TRANSITIONED TO 165X BILLETS.
    F.  LDO PHOTO ACCESSIONS WILL REMAIN OPEN FOR ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR 
TO KEEP FAITH WITH THOSE SAILORS WHO HAVE BEEN SELECTED AND ARE 
PROCEEDING ON A CAREER PATH TOWARD COMMISSIONING AS AN LDO.
