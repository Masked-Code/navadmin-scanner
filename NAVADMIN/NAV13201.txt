RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the acceptance of applications from
qualified active component (AC) and selected reserve (SELRES) officers
for the fall FY-14 full time support (FTS) officer transfer and 
redesignation board scheduled to convene on 5 November 2013.  Per 
ref (a), this board will also accept application packages from 
existing FTS officers requesting redesignation into another FTS officer
community.  The board will not accept applications for FTS submarine
warfare or explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) communities.

2.  Complete application packages and waiver requests must be received
NLT 1600 CST, 27 September 2013.  

3.  Eligibility.  The FTS program is offering opportunities for 
regular AC and SELRES officers to transition into the following FTS 
officer communities to meet immediate manning needs in the year group
(YG) indicated:
Community/Designator      Available YG(s)
FTS SWO (1167/1117)       01-04 (see para 3.a), 05 and junior
FTS SUB (1127)            none
FTS SPECWAR (1137)        05 and junior

FTS AVIATION (1317/1327)  02 and junior
FTS HR (1207)             00-01 (see para 3.a), 02 and junior
FTS AMDO (1527)           02 and junior
FTS SUPPLY (3107)         05-06, 08 and junior
    a.  Senior YG additional requirements by designator:
        (1) FTS SWO (1117).  YG 01-04 applicants must already have 
completed command qualifications, gained the LN7 additional qualification
designator (AQD), and must have qualified tactical action officer 
(TAO) and engineering officer of the watch (EOOW).  Alternately, YG 
01-04 applicants with significant and current Regional Collaboration
(RC) management experience such as a Naval Operational Support Center
(NOSC) commanding officer may apply with a waiver request endorsed 
by their reserve component commander ISIC.  (2) FTS HR (1207).  YG 00-01
applicants must already have completed a master's degree in manpower
systems analysis (MSA), operations analysis (OA), financial management
(FM), information technology (IT), information system technology 
(IST) or human resource (HR) related field of study.  All applicants
must have either two years of HR related experience or successfully 
completed a corresponding milestone tour in their source communities
(e.g. SWO Department Head or Aviation Department Head).  This criteria
is not waiverable.   
    b.  In addition to the above YG limitations, all applicants must
meet eligibility requirements outlined in ref (a) and the fall FY-14
FTS eligibility criteria document posted at http:www.public.navy.mil
/bupers-npc/officer/communitymanagers/reserve/fts/pages/
ftsredesignationboard.aspx.  General eligibility requirements include
projected rotation date (PRD), minimum service requirement (MSR) and
aviation career continuation pay (ACCP) limits as explained below:
        (1) PRD.  Any applicant (AC, FTS or SELRES on Active Duty for
Special Work (ADSW), mobilization or recall orders) must have a current
PRD NLT 7 May 2015.  
        (2) MSR.  Any applicant currently under an MSR must have an 
MSR end date on or prior to 7 November 2015.
        (3) ACCP.  Naval aviators and naval flight officers currently
obligated under ACCP must have an ACCP end date on or prior to 7 November
2014.  Obligated service due to ACCP is not waiverable.
    c.  YG eligibility may be adjusted based upon community 
requirements up until the application due date.  The most up-to-date
YG eligibility matrix will be posted on the FTS redesignation website.
    d.  Members who do not meet all eligibility requirements per ref
(a) and the fall FY-14 FTS eligibility criteria document posted on the
FTS redesignation board website may submit a waiver request as a part
of their application.  General eligibility requirements may be waived
(for example, if PRD eligibility is exceeded by one month).  However,
designator-specific eligibility requirements are not waiverable (for
example, applicants for FTS aviation must already be naval aviator or
naval flight officer qualified).
    e.  Waiver packages must include member's waiver request and 
commanding officer's endorsement of the waiver request.  This 
endorsement is separate from any endorsements contained in the 
member's transfer/redesignation application and must specifically 
address the eligibility criterion requiring a waiver.  An example of
a waiver request can be found at http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/communitymangers/reserve/fts/documents/fts%20redesig%20s
ampleofwaiverrequest.docx.
    f.  Reserve direct commission officers (DCO), limited duty officers
(LDO), and chief warrant officers (CWO) are eligible for the FTS 
program.  All officers applying to the FTS officer program must possess
a 4-year baccalaureate degree.  CWOs who are within six months of 
completing their baccalaureate degree may apply, but selection will 
be contingent upon completing the degree and redesignation will not 
occur until after degree is completed.  CWOs are considered without 
regard to YG in communities accepting applications and where they 
meet the eligibility requirements of ref (a) posted on the FTS officer
community manager (OCM) website.
    g.  SELRES officers currently serving under temporary recall orders
are encouraged to apply if they meet all other applicable eligibility
requirements.
    h.  Subject to other criteria, AC officers with a pending or 
approved resignation from AC are eligible and are strongly encouraged
to apply. 
    i.  Current eligibility requirements (both general and specific 
FTS officer community requirements), YG restrictions by community, 
and information on application procedures are posted on the FTS 
redesignation board website.  Applications from officers who do not 
meet eligibility criteria will not be considered by the board.  The 
FTS OCM website contains valuable information about the FTS program 
as well as information about the various FTS officer communities. 

4.  Application requirements.  Application packages for this board 
shall consist of two parts:  the BUPERS online (BOL) e-application 
and supporting documents to include waiver requests if applicable.
    a.  BOL e-application.  The BOL e-application can be accessed in
the application menu at www.bol.navy.mil.  Applicants will receive 
email confirmation that their e-application has been received.  
Although applicants may subsequently access the BOL e-application, 
only their most recent data will be saved as part of their application
package.  Applicants forward deployed with limited BOL access or 
connectivity issues should contact PSC Audrey Dixon at audrey.dixon(at)
navy.mil to discuss manual submission.  
    b.  Supporting documents.  Applicants must submit a cover letter
with command endorsement and evidence of medical/physical readiness 
depending upon the community to which the applicant is applying.  
Such documents will only be accepted directly from the applicant.  
Third-party submissions will not be considered.  Optional supporting 
documents may include:  letters of recommendation, FITREPS, awards, 
evidence of graduate education, or updated photo not already contained 
in the member's official military personnel file (OMPF).  Supporting 
documents can be submitted via one of the following methods:
      (1) Encrypted e-mail (preferred) to:  cscselboard(at)navy.mil.  
Subject line of e-mail should read:  Fall FY-14 FTS Officer Transfer/
Redesignation Board (#35) ICO (rank first name last name, designator).

    c.  To prevent the transmission of multiple copies of application
documents, applicants shall only submit their supporting documents 
via a single method and confirm receipt with the points of contact 
listed in paragraph 7.e. before resubmitting.  Applicants are encouraged
to review their service record on BOL via the OMPF link and to send 
only that supporting documentation (FITREPS, awards, etc.) which are

once the board proceedings are approved.  Applicants can expect to see 
the results posted within 45 days of board adjournment.  Selectees 
have 14 calendar days from the date results are released to accept/
decline FTS transfer/redesignation.  After this time, they may forfeit
their select status.
