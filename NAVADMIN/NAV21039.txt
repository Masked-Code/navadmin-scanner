RMKS/1.  This message shall be read in its entirety to ensure all 
stakeholders in the ship inactivation process are aware of the revised 
projected retirement schedule for fiscal year 2021 (FY21), respective 
responsibilities and necessary follow-up actions.
Ship retirement decisions reflected in paragraph 2 below align with the 
Presidents Budget for 2021.  This plan will be adjusted if necessary based on 
subsequent execution year decisions made by leadership or as required by 
Congressional action.

2.  To facilitate fleet planning efforts to conduct decommissioning 
continuous maintenance availability (CMAV) or inactivation availability 
(INAC), the revised projected schedule for inactivating U.S. battle force and 
non-battle force naval vessels in FY21 is promulgated as follows.  Note the 
below listed dates reflect the projected inactivation date, which is when 
custody of the vessel will be transferred to the inactive ships facility and 
its status will be updated in the Naval Vessel Register.  Decommissioning 
ceremony dates will be promulgated via Organizational Change Requests and 
inactivation SITREPS.

3.  Per reference (b), Fleet Commanders shall submit an Organizational Change 
Request for commissioned U.S. ships and per reference (a) to formally notify 
the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) of a ships 
decommissioning, inactivation, or end of service.  Submit revisions due to 
operational schedule changes per references (a) and (b).  It is the 
responsibility of Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command and Commander, U.S.
Pacific Fleet in coordination with their respective TYCOM to ensure the 
appropriate lower echelon commands are notified of any changes in the ship 
inactivation schedules, as well as Integrated Warfare (OPNAV N9I) and OPNAV 
resource sponsor.

4.  Adjustments to paragraph 2 ship inactivations that cross the current 
fiscal year must be coordinated with OPNAV N9I due to Congressional 
requirements for execution year force structure changes that differ from what 
Congress authorized/appropriated and signed into law by the President.  OPNAV 
shall promulgate changes to the inactivation fiscal year as required.

5.  The ships commanding officer, masters, or Immediate Superior In Command, 
shall submit a final naval message (normally transmitted in conjunction with 
the decommissioning ceremony) announcing the ships official retirement date 
and include a brief history of the significant events in the life of the ship 
per reference (a).  The Naval History and Heritage Command (NAVHISTHERITAGE 
WASHINGTON DC) and Naval Vessel Register Custodian (NVR NORFOLK VA), shall be 
included as INFO addees.
