SUBJ/POLICY FOR ACTIVATION AND EMPLOYMENT OF RESERVE COMPONENT FORCES IN FY24 
AND BEYOND//

REF/A/DOC/SECNAV/30JAN2023//
REF/B/MSG/OPNAV/012005ZFEB23//
REF/C/DOC/-/TITLE 10 U.S.C.//

NARR/Reference (a) is SECNAV Memo of 30JAN2023, which expands the ability to 
access Reserve Component (RC) Sailors for involuntary activation.  
Reference (b) is NAVADMIN defining employment policy for Reserve Component 
forces in FY23.   
Reference (c) is Title 10 U.S.C.

RMKS/1. This NAVADMIN defines policy for the activation and employment of 
Reserve Component (RC) forces, IAW reference (a).
This updated policy replaces reference (b) and provides guidance to the Force 
for utilization and fulfillment of Individual Augmentation (IA) requirements. 
This guidance will remain in effect indefinitely, or until canceled or 
superseded.

2. Policy. A Total Force sourcing policy enables the Navy's flexible response 
to global crisis, while supporting the RC focus on growing capacity and 
capability to compete in a high-end conflict. RC sourcing for Total Force 
requirements will continue primarily via volunteer IAs, while a small percent 
of non-volunteer activations may be required. When necessary, involuntary 
activation of SELRES members will be accomplished through billet-based 
activation (BBA) in accordance with the guidance contained in reference (a). 
BBA requires Sailors' IA mobilization billets to be an exact or substantial 
match for the duties and responsibilities for which SELRES are assigned or 
trained. Selection workflow as described ensures RC Sailors maintain currency 
for strategic competition either by fulfilling IA requirements that 
contribute substantially to maintaining their specific billet or core 
capability skills, thereby providing training and experience for RC Sailors, 
and ultimately enhancing warfighting readiness. The Navy's policy for Total 
Force sourcing ensures non-volunteer activations are both limited, and 
contribute to Sailors' warfighting readiness within the context of Strategic 
Competition if enacted.

3. RC personnel are authorized and highly encouraged to volunteer for 
mobilization opportunities. Volunteer activations will continue to be viewed 
favorably for promotion and advancement, as directed in selection board 
convening orders and precepts.

4. In addition to mobilizations, the RC provides support to Total Force 
missions via voluntary Active Duty for Operational Support (ADOS), Active 
Duty for Training (ADT), and Definite Recalls. AC commands may plan and 
budget for continued and expanded application of these order types to access 
additional RC support.
