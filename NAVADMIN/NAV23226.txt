NARR/REF A IS DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INSTRUCTION 1322.16, MONTGOMERY GI BILL 
PROGRAM.   
REF B IS BUPERS INSTRUCTION 1780.1A, GI BILL EDUCATION BENEFITS PROGRAMS. 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN implements changes to the period of election to 
enroll/disenroll from the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) as announced in reference 
(a) and serves to update policies and procedures in reference (b).  These 
changes have the potential to impact Sailor pay due to the fact that MGIB 
will cost $1,200 for each Sailor who does not actively opt out of MGIB.  Note 
that opting out of MGIB benefits does not impact the Service Member's Post  
9-11 GI Bill benefits. 
 
2.  Effective 5 January 2023, Active Duty Service Members are no longer 
authorized to make a decision to opt out of MGIB during initial entry 
training.  The opt out window will now occur between days 180 and 270 of 
service, counted from the first day a member enters Active Duty.  During this 
90-day window, all Service Members must be counseled and make a decision to 
opt out of MGIB. 
 
3.  Eligibility.  With the exception of graduates of the U.S. Naval Academy, 
Reserve Officer Training Corps Scholarship Program, and members with prior 
Active Duty service, all Service Members who enter Active Duty are 
automatically enrolled in MGIB unless they opt out during the 90-day window 
discussed in paragraph 2. 
 
4.  Enrollment.  Eligible Active Duty Service Members will be automatically 
enrolled under the MGIB Program, unless they decline this benefit.  In line 
with reference (b), a signed MGIB Act of 1984 Basic Enrollment form (revised 
September 2022), Department of Defense (DD) Form 2366, is required to be 
signed by all eligible members.  Service Members may only complete the form 
once and the election is irrevocable. 
 
5.  Mandatory Counseling.  All Active Duty Service Members will be counseled 
on the MGIB program at least once before their 270th day and must be given 
the opportunity to opt out of MGIB between their 180th and 270th day of 
Active Duty.  If not declined, payroll deduction for MGIB enrollment will 
begin the month following the Service Member's 270th day at $100 per month 
for 12 months.  Note that the Post 9-11 GI Bill is no cost to the Service 
Member. 
 
6.  Since the majority of affected Service Members will still be in the 
training pipeline when they reach their decision window, MyNavy HR will 
provide the required counseling and ensure a signed election form is received 
and processed for those Service Members.  For Service Members who report to 
their command before their election window, commands will be responsible for 
taking the following actions: 
    a.  Provide counseling on education opportunities.  MGIB New 
Accession Counseling tool is available at 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Education/GI-Bill/MGIB-
Enrollment/. 
    b.  Advise Service Members of their 90-day MGIB election window to ensure 
timely completion of enrollment/disenrollment requirements and to prevent 
erroneous pay deductions.  No later than day 240 ensure all Service Members 
have completed, electronically signed, and submitted the DD Form 2366 to 
ensure timely processing ahead of day 270. 
    c.  Command Pay and Personnel Assistants will submit DD Form 2366 to 
MyNavy Career Center and must periodically review the Navy Standard 
Integrated Personnel System to ensure that all Sailors at their command are 
counselled and complete their election in the designated window. 
 
7.  For specific instructions, best practices for counseling, completing and 
submitting DD Form 2366, refer to training presentation at  
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Education/GI-Bill/MGIB-
Enrollment/. 
 
8.  For questions concerning MGIB policy, contact LCDR Matthew Sullivan at 
(703)604-5310 or matthew.c.sullivan16.mil@us.navy.mil. 
 
9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
