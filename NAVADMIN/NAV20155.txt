RMKS/1. TO INCREASE PROBABILITY OF A COVID-FREE MISSION READY CREW, UNITS 
WILL ADHERE TO THE FOLLOWING STANDARDIZED OPERATIONAL GUIDANCE.
FLEET, TYCOM, AND OPERATIONAL COMMANDERS MAY ISSUE MORE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE TO 
UNITS WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY.  THIS GUIDANCE BUILDS 
ON REFS (A) AND (B) WHILE INCORPORATING GUIDANCE FROM REFS (C) THROUGH (E).  
IT WILL GUIDE HEALTH PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS AND UNITS, PRESERVATION OF 
OPERATIONAL READINESS, AND PROTECTION OF SHIPMATES, INSTALLATIONS, AND 
COMMUNITIES FROM COVID-19 TRANSMISSION.  ALTHOUGH BIASED TOWARD THE SHIPBOARD 
ENVIRONMENT, THIS GUIDANCE APPLIES TO ALL PERSONNEL AND UNITS DEPLOYING TO 
AND FROM HOMEPORT (ORIGINATING UNIT LOCATION FOR RESERVE PERSONNEL).  IT DOES 
NOT APPLY TO ROUTINE TRAVEL (E.G., TDY, TAD) UNLESS CONNECTED WITH A 
DEPLOYING INDIVIDUAL OR UNIT.
ADHERENCE TO THIS STANDARDIZED GUIDANCE INCLUDES ACCOUNTING FOR SPECIFIC 
CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVING CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS PER PARAGRAPH 9.
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES MAY NECESSITATE WAIVERS TO THIS GUIDANCE TO MEET 
EMERGENT OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS.  THE NAVAL COMPONENT COMMANDER
(NCC) IS THE WAIVER AUTHORITY UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED.

2. DEFINITIONS.

2.A. COVID-19 CASE: A MEMBER DESIGNATED BY A MEDICAL PROVIDER BY ONE OF TWO 
METHODS:  1) A POSITIVE COVID-19 LABORATORY TEST,  OR 2) ASSESSED AS PRESUMED 
POSITIVE PER THE COUNCIL OF STATE AND TERRITORIAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST
(CSTE) CRITERIA FOR A PROBABLE CASE.

2.B. PATIENT (OR PERSON) UNDER INVESTIGATION (PUI): AN INDIVIDUAL WITH SIGNS 
OR SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 WHO HAS A TEST RESULT PENDING OR WOULD HAVE BEEN 
TESTED HAD A TEST BEEN AVAILABLE.  MEMBERS ARE NO LONGER A PUI WHEN
THEY:  A) RECEIVE A NEGATIVE COVID-19 LAB TEST RESULT; OR, B) HAVE MET ALL 
CRITERIA FOR RETURN TO WORK IN PARAGRAPH 7.D.  ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS 
QUARANTINED DUE TO CLOSE CONTACT WITH A COVID POSITIVE MEMBER ARE NOT 
CLASSIFIED PUI.  ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS BEING TESTED FOR
COVID-19 ARE NOT CONSIDERED PUIS WHILE AWAITING TEST RESULTS.

2.C. HIGH-RISK PERSONNEL: THOSE INDIVIDUALS, DESIGNATED BY A MEDICAL 
PROVIDER, THAT MEET THE CDC HIGH-RISK CRITERIA AVAILABLE AT:
HTTPS://WWW.CDC.GOV/CORONAVIRUS/2019-NCOV/NEED-EXTRA-PRECAUTIONS/PEOPLE-
AT-HIGHER-RISK.HTML   THIS LIST EVOLVES AS KNOWLEDGE OF COVID-19 GROWS
AND SHOULD BE CHECKED FREQUENTLY.

2.D. CLOSE CONTACT:  INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED AS BEING WITHIN APPROXIMATELY
6 FEET (2 METERS) OF A COVID-19 CASE FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME (>15 
MINUTES).  CLOSE CONTACT CAN OCCUR WHILE CARING FOR, LIVING WITH, VISITING, 
WORKING WITH, OR SHARING A DENSELY POPULATED SPACE WITH A
COVID-19 CASE.  CLOSE CONTACT CAN ALSO BE ESTABLISHED VIA DIRECT CONTACT 
(E.G., BEING COUGHED OR SNEEZED UPON BY A COVID-19 CASE).  DETERMINATION OF 
CLOSE CONTACT PRESUMES THE INTERACTION TRANSPIRED DURING THE COVID-19 CASES 
POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS PERIOD CURRENTLY DEFINED AS 48 HOURS PRIOR TO SYMPTOM 
ONSET (OR POSITIVE TEST IF ASYMPTOMATIC) TO THE TIME THE
COVID-19 CASE IS PLACED IN ISOLATION.  SOME EXAMPLES SPECIFIC TO THE 
SHIPBOARD ENVIRONMENT INCLUDE:  A) INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE COVID-19 CASES 
BERTHING AREA ASSIGNED AN ADJACENT RACK INCLUDING DIRECTLY ACROSS A NARROW 
AISLE; B) PROLONGED INTERACTION WITHIN RELATIVELY CONFINED SPACES INTERNAL TO 
THE SHIP (E.G., WORK SPACE, GALLEY, GYM, SMOKING DECK, CHAPEL, ETC.).

2.E. MEDICAL SCREENING:  COVID-19 MEDICAL SCREENING SHOULD INCLUDE EVALUATION 
FOR BOTH TYPICAL AND ATYPICAL SYMPTOMS. TYPICAL SYMPTOMS OF
COVID-19 INCLUDE: COUGH, SHORTNESS OF BREATH OR DIFFICULTY BREATHING, FEVER, 
CHILLS, MUSCLE PAIN, GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS, AND RECENT LOSS OF TASTE OR 
SMELL.  ATYPICAL SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: SORE 
THROAT, RHINORRHEA (RUNNY NOSE), NASAL CONGESTION, NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, 
HEADACHE, INCREASED CONFUSION, DIZZINESS, AND MALAISE.
A COMPLETE LIST OF COVID-19 SYMPTOMS CAN BE FOUND AT:
HTTPS://WWW.CDC.GOV/CORONAVIRUS/2019-NCOV/SYMPTOMS-TESTING/SYMPTOMS.HTML.

2.F. SELF-MONITORING. PER THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION 
(CDC), SELF-MONITORING INCLUDES ASSESSING ONSET OF FEVER BY TAKING ONES 
TEMPERATURE TWICE A DAY AND REMAINING ALERT FOR THE ONSET OF COUGH OR 
BREATHING DIFFICULTY.  CDC DEFINES FEVER AS TEMPERATURE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL 
TO 100.4 F (38C) DEGREES.  INDIVIDUALS THAT DEVELOP FEVER, COUGH, OR 
BREATHING DIFFICULTY SHOULD IMMEDIATELY SELF-ISOLATE, LIMIT CONTACT WITH 
OTHERS, AND SEEK ADVICE BY TELEPHONE FROM A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER TO DETERMINE 
IF FURTHER MEDICAL EVALUATION IS REQUIRED.

2.G. RESTRICTION OF MOVEMENT (ROM).  GENERAL DOD TERM FOR LIMITING PERSONAL 
INTERACTION TO REDUCE RISK TO THE HEALTH, SAFETY AND WELFARE OF A BROADER 
COHORT.  ROM IS USED TO MINIMIZE RISK OF INDIVIDUALS ENCOUNTERING COVID-19 
CONTAGIOUS INDIVIDUALS, AND TO PREVENT PERSONNEL WHO HAVE BEEN IN A HIGHER 
RISK AREA FROM POTENTIALLY INFECTING OTHERS.
ROM INCLUDES ISOLATION, QUARANTINE AND ROM-SEQUESTER.

2.G.1. ISOLATION: MEDICAL TERM FOR THE STRICT SEPARATION OF PERSONNEL FROM 
OTHERS DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF POTENTIAL COVID-19 SYMPTOMS OR A POSITIVE 
COVID-19 TEST.

2.G.2. QUARANTINE: MEDICAL TERM FOR SEPARATING ASYMPTOMATIC PERSONNEL FROM 
THOSE PEOPLE REASONABLY BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO A COMMUNICABLE 
DISEASE, TO PREVENT THE POSSIBLE SPREAD OF THE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE.  FOR THE 
COVID-19 PANDEMIC, PERSONNEL WITH NO COVID-19 SYMPTOMS WHO HAVE RECENTLY 
RETURNED FROM A HIGHER RISK LOCATION OR HAD CLOSE CONTACT WITH A KNOWN COVID-
19 POSITIVE PATIENT SHOULD BE QUARANTINED.
THE QUARANTINE PERIOD IS 14 DAYS.

2.G.3. ROM-SEQUESTER: U.S. NAVY TERM FOR PREEMPTIVE SEPARATION OF FORCES TO 
REDUCE RISK OF INFECTION WHILE ESTABLISHING A COVID-FREE BUBBLE.
ROM-SEQUESTER CAN BE CONDUCTED ONBOARD SHIP, IN CONTRACTED FACILITIES, OR IN 
PERSONAL RESIDENCE DEPENDENT ON UNIT-SPECIFIC SCENARIOS.  DURING ROM-
SEQUESTER, INTERACTION WITH INDIVIDUALS TRAVELING OUTSIDE OF THE ROM-
SEQUESTER LOCATION MUST BE MINIMIZED.  INTERACTION WITHIN ROM-SEQUESTER 
LOCATION IS RESTRICTED TO BASIC NECESSITIES SUCH AS FOOD DELIVERY.

2.H. BUBBLE.  U.S. NAVY TERM FOR INDIVIDUALS, UNITS OR INSTALLATIONS THAT 
HAVE ESTABLISHED LOW PROBABILITY OF COVID-19 INFECTION. A CREW THAT HAS BEEN 
UNDERWAY, OR ROM-SEQUESTERED AT THE PIER, FOR GREATER THAN 14 DAYS WITHOUT 
COVID-19 POSITIVE PERSONNEL AND NO COVID-19 SYMPTOMS IS WITHIN A BUBBLE.

2.I. BUBBLE TO BUBBLE TRANSFER (B2BT). U.S. NAVY TERM FOR MOVEMENT OF UNITS 
OR PERSONNEL FROM ONE BUBBLE TO ANOTHER VIA CONTROLLED MEANS.  A WIDE VARIETY 
OF MODES/MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION CAN BE USED FOR B2BT.  THE KEY FACTOR IS 
THAT THE EVOLUTION IS CLOSELY CONTROLLED TO MINIMIZE RISK OF
COVID-19 EXPOSURE.

3. MINIMUM ACTION REQUIRED PRIOR TO DEPLOYED OPERATIONS.

3.A. MANDATORY MEDICAL SCREENING BY A MEDICAL PROVIDER.

3.A.1. PRE-DEPLOYMENT SCREENING WILL CONSIST OF AN ASSESSMENT OF COVID-19 
EXPOSURE HISTORY, A TEMPERATURE CHECK, A CHECK FOR COVID-19 SIGNS AND 
SYMPTOMS LISTED IN PARA 2.E, REVIEW OF ANY PAST COVID-19 TESTING AND A 
THOROUGH EVALUATION OF THE MEMBERS HIGH RISK FACTORS.

3.A.2. RECOMMENDATIONS TO DEPLOY HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS MUST BE APPROVED, AT A 
MINIMUM, BY THE ISIC.  MILITARY SEALIFT COMMAND WILL MEDICALLY SCREEN CIVIL 
SERVICE AND CONTRACT PERSONNEL FOR DEPLOYMENT ON MSC VESSELS IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH EXISTING MSC INSTRUCTIONS AND CONTRACTS.

3.B. CONDUCT MINIMUM 14-DAY ROM-SEQUESTER PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT. DEPENDING ON 
SCHEDULE AND OPERATIONS, THE NCC WILL DETERMINE IF ROM-SEQUESTER IS WARRANTED 
PRIOR TO INTEGRATED PHASE.

3.B.1. CONDUCT DAILY PERSONNEL SCREENING (QUESTIONNAIRE/TEMPERATURE CHECKS).

3.B.2. ALL PERSONNEL DEPLOYING OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WILL UNDERGO A 14-
DAY ROM-SEQUESTER PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT.  IF TRAVELING OCONUS AND THE HOST 
NATION REQUIRES 14-DAY IN-COUNTRY ROM, CONUS PRE-DEPLOYMENT ROM-SEQUESTER IS 
NOT REQUIRED UNLESS THE HOST NATION EXPLICITLY MANDATES BOTH.

3.B.3. ACCEPTABLE ROM-SEQUESTER FACILITIES ARE:  SHIP BERTHING, LIVING BARGE, 
INDIVIDUAL BARRACKS/HOTEL ROOMS, OR PERSONAL RESIDENCE (WITH LIMITED CONTACT 
WITH OTHER RESIDENTS).  EACH HAS PROS AND CONS THAT MUST BE WEIGHED AGAINST 
UNIT-SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES AND RISK.  MINIMIZING CONTACT WITH OTHERS AND 
FOLLOWING PUBLIC HEALTH MITIGATION MEASURES IS CRITICAL TO SUCCESSFUL ROM-
SEQUESTER.

3.B.4. PRACTICE PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND SANITIZE MORE FREQUENTLY  WHILE 
MANNING ESSENTIAL WATCH STATIONS, COMPLETING REQUIRED MAINTENANCE, AND 
CONDUCTING REQUIRED UNDERWAY PREPARATION (LOGISTICS, TRAINING, ETC.).

3.B.5. DEVELOP OPERATIONAL BENCH FOR REDLINE PERSONNEL TO MAINTAIN MISSION 
ESSENTIAL OPERATIONS (NUCLEAR POWER PLANT, BRIDGE, COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER, 
CWC WATCHES, MEDICAL PROVIDERS, ETC.).

3.C. DEPLOYING UNITS WILL TEST OUT OF ROM-SEQUESTER PER FLEET APPROVED 
COMMUNITY CONOPS. THESE CONOPS WERE REVIEWED BY BUMED FOR THE LATEST 
SCIENTIFIC EFFICACY AND SHOULD BE FOLLOWED TO ENSURE STANDARDIZATION AND 
CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE FORCE.  TESTING IS THE BEST WAY TO IDENTIFY 
ASYMPTOMATIC COVID-19 POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS.  HOWEVER, TESTING DOES NOT 
GUARANTEE A CLEAN DEPLOYING UNIT DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR FALSE NEGATIVE 
TESTS.

3.D. SHIP RIDERS (E.G., CONTRACTORS, TECH REPS, INSPECTION TEAMS, ETC.), 
DIRECT SUPPORT PERSONNEL, AND ALL OTHERS  ASSISTING COMMANDS PRIOR TO BUBBLE 
ESTABLISHMENT WILL ADHERE TO LOCAL FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS  
(DAILY SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE, TEMPERATURE CHECKS, PPE, RESTRICT SHIPBOARD 
MOVEMENT, SANITIZATION, ETC.).  WHEN INVOLVED IN MOVEMENT TO SEQUENTIAL 
COMMANDS, IT MAY BE ADVISABLE TO ROM-SEQUESTER TEAMS, USE B2BT, AND TEST 
PERIODICALLY.

3.E. SHIP RIDERS (E.G., CONTRACTORS, TECH REPS, INSPECTION TEAMS, ETC.), 
DIRECT SUPPORT PERSONNEL, AND ALL OTHERS PENETRATING AN ESTABLISHED BUBBLE 
WILL COMPLETE A 14-DAY ROM-SEQUESTER AND TEST OUT PRIOR TO EMBARKING.
OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS MAY SOMETIMES PRECLUDE THIS PRIOR TO SUPPORT 
PERSONNEL PENETRATING AN ESTABLISHED BUBBLE.  NCC APPROVAL IS REQUIRED TO 
PENETRATE AN ESTABLISHED BUBBLE.

4. MINIMUM REQUIRED ACTION FOR MAINTENANCE, BASIC, ADVANCED/INTEGRATED, AND 
SUSTAINMENT PHASES.

4.A. MAINTENANCE PHASE.  AGGRESSIVE AWARENESS, DIAGNOSIS, CONTACT TRACING, 
AND IN SOME CASES, ROM-SEQUESTER ARE CRITICAL TO COMBAT COVID-19.
COMMANDERS MUST REMAIN ALERT TO THE REALITY SOME SAILORS CARRYING COVID-19 
MAY BE ASYMPTOMATIC AND MITIGATE RISKS ACCORDINGLY. THE FOLLOWING MINIMUM 
MEASURES APPLY:

4.A.1. FOLLOW LOCAL HPCON STATUS AND FHP MEASURES.  EMPHASIZE PERSONAL 
RESPONSIBILITY (FACE MASKS, PHYSICAL DISTANCING, AVOID LOCAL AREAS WITH HIGH 
POPULATION DENSITY, SELF-MONITOR, ETC.).  REPORT AND ISOLATE PERSONNEL WITH 
COVID-19 SYMPTOMS. SCREEN ALL PERSONNEL AND VISITORS DAILY AT WORK, TO 
INCLUDE TEMPERATURE CHECKS.  CLEAN AND DISINFECT SPACES DAILY IAW NAVSEA 
CLEANING GUIDANCE.  CONSIDER ADDITIONAL COVID-19 ORM MEASURES FOR MAJOR 
EVENTS (E.G., DRILLS).

4.A.2. SUPPORT ORGANIZATION COMMANDERS (E.G., SHIPYARD PERSONNEL, CONTRACT 
SUPPORT, TRAINING TEAMS, ETC.), SHOULD CONSIDER CURRENT HPCON, CDC THREAT 
LEVEL, METHOD/MODE OF TRAVEL, ETC WHEN ASSESSING RISK AND DETERMINING IF ROM-
SEQUESTER IS WARRANTED.  FOR EXAMPLE, A TEAM OF SHIPYARD WORKERS MOVING FROM 
AN AREA WITH LOW COVID CASES TO AN AREA OF LOW, MEDIUM OR HIGH COVID CASES 
MIGHT NOT WARRANT ROM-SEQUESTER UNLESS COMPELLED BY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH 
AS TRAVEL THROUGH A HIGH RISK AIRPORT.  REGARDLESS, VISITORS SHOULD FOLLOW 
THE SAME DAILY SCREENING PROCEDURES, SELF-MONITORING, TEMPERATURE CHECKS, 
PPE, AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY PROTOCOLS AS SHIPS FORCE.

4.A.3 AIRCRAFT SQUADRON COMMANDERS SHOULD CONSIDER THE CURRENT RISK LEVEL PER 
PARAGRAPH 4.A.2 TO DETERMINE IF ROM-SEQUESTER IS REQUIRED FOR TRAINING 
DETACHMENTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, A SAILOR MAY USE A PERSONAL VEHICLE TO DRIVE FROM 
MILITARY BASE TO MILITARY BASE WITH INFREQUENT GAS OR FOOD STOPS TO MAINTAIN 
A MODIFIED BUBBLE.  REGARDLESS, TRAVELERS SHOULD FOLLOW THE SAME DAILY 
SCREENING PROCEDURES, SELF-MONITORING, TEMPERATURE CHECKS, PPE, AND PERSONAL 
RESPONSIBILITY PROTOCOLS DICTATED BY LOCAL HPCON CONDITIONS.

4.B. BASIC PHASE.  INCLUDES SAME MEASURES AS THE MAINTENANCE PHASE, PLUS:

4.B.1. UNDERWAY OPERATIONS WITH ABILITY TO GET MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITY
(MTF) SUPPORT WITHIN 72 HOURS.  SCREEN HIGH RISK SAILORS AND ENSURE PPE 
LOADOUT MEETS FLEET GUIDANCE.  FOLLOW PLATFORM SPECIFIC COVID-19 CONOPS AND 
SOPS.

4.B.2. UNDERWAY OPERATIONS WHEN MTF SUPPORT WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE WITHIN
72 HOURS.  SAME MEASURES AS LOCAL OPERATIONS, PLUS, IAW FLEET COMMANDER 
GUIDANCE, CONSIDER MEDICAL TEAM AUGMENT, MEDEVAC AUGMENT/HELO CAPABILITY, AND 
SHIPBOARD TESTING CAPABILITY.

4.C. ADVANCED AND INTEGRATED PHASES. SAME MEASURES AS MAINTENANCE AND BASIC 
PHASES, PLUS:

4.C.1. IF DEPLOYING IMMEDIATELY AFTER INTEGRATED PHASE (I.E., COMPTUEX(C2X)) 
OR PRE-OVERSEAS MOVEMENT EVALUATION (POMEVAL), FOLLOW GUIDANCE IN PARAGRAPH 
3.

4.D. SUSTAINMENT PHASE.

4.D.1. UNDERWAY:  MAINTAIN BUBBLE PER PARAGRAPH 3.E.

4.D.2. PIER-SIDE: FOLLOWING DEPLOYMENT, FOLLOW BASIC PHASE GUIDANCE.
OPERATIONAL COMMANDERS MAY ELECT TO SHIFT TO PARAGRAPH 3 GUIDANCE DEPENDING 
ON LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS.

4.E. FOR ALL PHASES, DISCIPLINED INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH 
PROTECTION MEASURES ARE THE BEDROCK OF RISK REDUCTION AND RISK MITIGATION.  
COVID MITIGATION PROTOCOL, WHERE APPROPRIATE, SHOULD CONSIDER ADDITIONAL 
SUPPORT FOR HIGH RISK PERSONNEL.  COMMANDERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT, MANAGEMENT, OVERSIGHT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PROTOCOLS FOR THEIR 
UNITS. INDIVIDUALS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTING THOSE PROTOCOLS.

5. DUE TO UNIQUE NATURE OF FORWARD DEPLOYED NAVAL FORCES (FDNF) AND THEIR 
HOST NATION RELATIONSHIP, NCCS WILL DEFINE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FDNF 
UNITS USING SECTIONS 3 AND 4 AS THE BASIS.

6. COMMANDERS MAY NEED TO EXEMPT AIRCREW AND AIRCRAFT MAINTAINERS FROM THIS 
GUIDANCE TO MEET EMERGENT OPERATIONAL OR NATOPS CURRENCY REQUIREMENTS.
ROBUST RISK MITIGATION IS REQUIRED TO MINIMIZE COVID THREATS TO EXISTING 
BUBBLES.  MITIGATION PLANS MUST BE APPROVED BY THE NCC.

7. ACTION WHEN A CREW MEMBER, MILITARY, OR CIVILIAN EXHIBITS SIGNS OR 
SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 INFECTION.

7.A. ISOLATE AND MEDICALLY SCREEN THE CREW MEMBER.  DESIGNATE AS PUI.
RESTRICT CONTACT WITH THE REST OF THE CREW/OPERATIONAL BENCH.

7.A.1. IF ISOLATED ABOARD SHIP, USE SMALL BERTHING AREAS (E.G., STATEROOMS) 
FOR SEPARATION.  WHEN ADEQUATE SHIPBOARD ISOLATION  CAPACITY IS EXHAUSTED, 
CONSIDER TRANSFERRING PUIS TO UNITS WITH REMAINING CAPACITY OR ASHORE.

7.A.2. IF ISOLATED OFF SHIP, PROVIDE PUI MEDICAL TREATMENT UNTIL CLINICALLY 
IMPROVED.

7.B. IDENTIFY, QUARANTINE, AND MEDICALLY SCREEN CLOSE CONTACTS OF COVID-19 
CASES AND SYMPTOMATIC PUIS AS DEFINED IN PARAGRAPHS 2.A AND 2.B.  MINIMUM 
SCREENING SHOULD INCLUDE A QUESTIONNAIRE TO ASSESS RISK TO EXPOSURE, 
TEMPERATURE CHECK, AND VISUAL CHECK FOR SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS PER THE CDC.
WHEN ADEQUATE SHIPBOARD QUARANTINE CAPACITY IS EXHAUSTED, CONSIDER 
TRANSFERRING CLOSE CONTACTS TO UNITS WITH REMAINING CAPACITY OR ASHORE.

7.B.1. QUARANTINE CLOSE CONTACTS FOR 14 DAYS.  AFTER 14 DAYS, IF 
ASYMPTOMATIC, RELEASE FROM QUARANTINE.

7.B.2.  PER PARAGRAPH 2.B., ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS QUARANTINED DUE TO CLOSE 
CONTACT ARE NOT CONSIDERED PUI.

7.B.3. IF CLOSE CONTACT BECOMES SYMPTOMATIC - FOLLOW PUI PROTOCOL.

7.C. PROTOCOL FOR PUI.

7.C.1 TEST PUI IF POSSIBLE. IF TEST RESULT POSITIVE - CONTINUE ISOLATION AND 
TREAT.  IF TEST NEGATIVE - PROVIDE MEDICAL TREATMENT UNTIL CLINICALLY 
IMPROVED.  IF TEST NEGATIVE AND PUI DOES NOT IMPROVE - ISOLATE AND FOLLOW 
PARAGRAPH 7.D.  IF NO TEST PERFORMED - PROCEED WITH STEPS 7.C.2 AND 7.C.3 
BELOW.

7.C.2. MEDICALLY SCREEN TWICE A DAY AT A MINIMUM.

7.C.3. IF SYMPTOMS WORSEN, CONSULT MEDICAL AUTHORITIES REGARDING TRANSFER TO 
MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITY.

7.D. RETURN TO WORK GUIDANCE FOR COVID-19 CASES.

7.D.1. OPERATIONAL UNITS.  COVID-19 CASES MUST MEET ALL OF THE FOLLOWING 
CRITERIA TO RETURN TO WORK:  (1) AT LEAST 72 HOURS HAVE PASSED SINCE RECOVERY 
[DEFINED AS RESOLUTION OF FEVER WITHOUT THE USE OF FEVER REDUCING 
MEDICATION], (2) **FREE** OF ALL SYMPTOMS, AND (3) AT LEAST 14 DAYS HAVE 
ELAPSED SINCE THE SYMPTOMS FIRST APPEARED.

7.D.2. ALL UNITS EXCEPT OPERATIONAL UNITS.  COVID-19 CASES MAY RETURN TO WORK 
AFTER MEETING ALL REQUIREMENTS OF SYMPTOM BASED CRITERIA OR TEST BASED 
CRITERIA.  TEST BASED CRITERIA MUST USE AN FDA APPROVED MOLECULAR ASSAY FOR 
DETECTION OF SARS-COV-2 RNA.

7.D.2.A. SYMPTOM-BASED CRITERIA:  (1) AT LEAST 72 HOURS HAVE PASSED SINCE 
RECOVERY [DEFINED AS RESOLUTION OF FEVER WITHOUT THE USE OF FEVER REDUCING 
MEDICATION], (2) **IMPROVEMENT** IN RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS (E.G., COUGH,

COUGH, SHORTNESS OF BREATH), AND (3) NEGATIVE PCR TEST RESULTS FROM AT LEAST 
TWO CONSECUTIVE RESPIRATORY SPECIMENS COLLECTED MORE THAN OR EQUAL TO 24 
HOURS APART.

7.E. POSITIVE TEST RESULT FOLLOWING SECTION 7.D. RETURN TO WORK CLEARANCE.
CORRECTLY CLEARED INDIVIDUALS MAY CONTINUE TO TEST POSITIVE FOR UP TO THREE 
MONTHS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF PERSISTENT NON-INFECTIOUS VIRAL FRAGMENTS.  
THEREFORE, INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE MET SECTION 7.D. CLEARANCE CRITERIA AND HAVE 
A SUBSEQUENT POSITIVE TEST WITHIN THREE MONTHS CAN REMAIN AT WORK.  
INDIVIDUALS THAT EXHIBIT NEW OR PERSISTENT SYMPTOMS SHOULD BE EVALUATED BY A 
MEDICAL PROVIDER.

8. POST-DEPLOYMENT/REDEPLOYMENT.

8.A. MILITARY MEMBERS REDEPLOYING TO CONUS WILL COMPLETE A 14-DAY ROM-
SEQUESTER AT HOME STATION.  MEMBERS RETURNING VIA SHIP OR MILAIR WITH NO 
HISTORY OF COVID-19, MAY COUNT TRANSIT TIME (BEGINNING ON THE DAY OF 
DEPARTURE FROM THE LAST PORT OR AIRFIELD) TOWARDS THE ROM-SEQUESTER 
REQUIREMENT.  SERVICE MEMBERS ON POST-DEPLOYMENT ROM-SEQUESTER ARE RESTRICTED 
TO THEIR PERSONAL RESIDENCE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE DOMICILE AND MUST LIMIT 
CLOSE CONTACT.  IF NECESSARY, ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE MADE WITHIN BARRACKS TO 
MINIMIZE CONTACT.

8.B. AT THE COMPLETION OF DEPLOYMENT, ALL PERSONNEL WILL COMPLETE A POST-
DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT (DD FORM 2796) AND POST-DEPLOYMENT HEALTH 
REASSESSMENT (DD FORM 2900) IN ACCORDANCE WITH REF (E).

8.C. REDEPLOYING INDIVIDUALS MUST BE SCREENED AT THE ASSIGNED PLACE OF DUTY
