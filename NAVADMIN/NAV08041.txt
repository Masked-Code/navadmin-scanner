2.  TO ENSURE OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS NOW AND IN THE FUTURE, OUR 
NAVY MUST ATTRACT THE HIGHEST QUALITY RECRUITS AND PRIOR SERVICE 
VETERANS.  A VIGOROUS RECRUITING PLAN REQUIRES FLEXIBLE TOOLS TO 
ENSURE WE ARE RECRUITING THE CORRECT NUMBER OF SAILORS WITH THE RIGHT 
SKILLS TO OPTIMIZE OUR WAR-FIGHTING CAPABILITY. 
3.  THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS IDENTIFY EACH BONUS PROGRAM.  GUIDANCE IN 
THIS NAVADMIN SUPERSEDES REF B IN ANY AREA WHERE THE TWO MAY CONFLICT. 
    A.  GENERAL:  ALL SIX-YEAR PRIOR SERVICE/AFFILIATION BONUSES ARE 
PAYABLE IN A LUMP SUM.  ALL TIER ONE BONUSES ARE ALSO PAYABLE IN A 
LUMP SUM REGARDLESS OF LENGTH OF ENLISTMENT.  SAILORS ARE HIGHLY 
ENCOURAGED TO ENLIST FOR A SIX-YEAR SELRES OBLIGATION TO MAXIMIZE 
THEIR BONUS OPPORTUNITY.

        (1) ALL BASIC ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA CONTAINED IN REF B REMAIN 
IN EFFECT. 
        (2) BONUS EFFECTIVE DATE IS DETERMINED BY THE DATE A SAILOR 
CONTRACTS IN THE ARMED FORCES (DELAYED ENTRY PROGRAM (DEP) DATE), AND 
NOT THE DATE A SAILOR SHIPS TO RECRUIT TRAINING (BOOT CAMP). 
    C.  PRIOR SERVICE AFFILIATION/ENLISTMENT BONUS 
        (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SAILORS TO GAIN ENTITLEMENT FOR 
THE AFFILIATION BONUS ARE AS FOLLOW:

NAVY RESERVE IN A PAY STATUS FOR A MINIMUM OF THREE YEARS TO QUALIFY 
FOR A THREE-YEAR BONUS OR A MINIMUM OF SIX YEARS TO QUALIFY FOR A

QUALIFY FOR A THREE-YEAR BONUS. 
            (C) MUST NOT HAVE COMPLETED MORE THAN 16 YEARS OF TOTAL 
MILITARY SERVICE FROM THEIR PAY ENTRY BASE DATE (PEBD) PRIOR TO THEIR 
CURRENT AFFILIATION/ENLISTMENT DATE.

12 MONTHS PRECEDING THEIR CURRENT AFFILIATION/ENLISTMENT DATE.

(RESCORE-R) PROGRAM 
    A.  PRIOR SERVICE ACTIVE DUTY SAILORS, APPROVED FOR ENLISTMENT VIA 
THE RESCORE-R PROGRAM IN AN ELIGIBLE RATING, MAY APPLY FOR A PRIOR

AFFILIATION AND THE REMAINDER OF THE BONUS WILL BE PAID WHEN THE NEW 
RATE IS MADE PERMANENT.

(NAVOPSPTCENS) MUST CLEARLY EXPLAIN THAT BONUS PAYMENTS FOR RESCORE-R
