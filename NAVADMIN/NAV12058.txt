RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE KICK OFF OF THE 2012 MILITARY SAVES 
CAMPAIGN 19-26 FEBRUARY 2012.

2. THE MILITARY SAVES CAMPAIGN, DEVELOPED THROUGH A COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT 
BETWEEN DOD AND THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA (CFA), ENCOURAGES 
LEADERSHIP TO PROMOTE WEALTH BUILDING MESSAGES AND CONDUCT UNIT LEVEL 
CAMPAIGNS AND EVENTS FOR A MULTITUDE OF FINANCIAL PROGRAMS. THE GOAL OF THE 
CAMPAIGN IS TO ENCOURAGE LONG-TERM FINANCIAL FITNESS BY DISCOURAGING HIGH 
DEBT, SHORT TERM BORROWING AND BY EDUCATING SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES 
ON GOAL SETTING, PLANNING, AND SAVING. THIS YEARS THEME IS "SET A GOAL, MAKE A 
PLAN, AND SAVE AUTOMATICALLY."

3.  IN ORDER TO BETTER POSITION OURSELVES IN AN EVER CHANGING ECONOMY, IT IS 
IMPERATIVE THAT COMMANDS CREATE A CULTURE THAT ENCOURAGES SAVINGS AND 
FINANCIAL READINESS.  POOR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ADVERSELY AFFECTS BOTH MISSION 
READINESS AND THE WELL BEING OF OUR SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES. SAILORS AND 
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS CAN BECOME AUTOMATIC SAVERS BY TAKING AN ONLINE PLEDGE AT 
WWW.MILITARYSAVES.ORG. A SOUND SAVINGS INITIATIVE IS CRITICAL TO MAKING OUR 
FORCES FINANCIALLY READY.

4.  TO ENCOURAGE MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION, COMMAND LEADERSHIP SHOULD PARTNER WITH 
THE COMMAND FINANCIAL SPECIALIST, PERSONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT (PFM) 
PROFESSIONAL, THE FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTER ALONG WITH OTHER KEY COMMAND 
LEADERS IN COORDINATING AND PROMOTING EDUCATIONAL EVENTS, WORKSHOPS AND OTHER 
CREATIVE ACTIVITIES.
IN ADDITION, LEADERSHIP SHOULD ENCOURAGE A CULTURE WITHIN THEIR COMMAND WHERE 
SAILORS FEEL COMFORTABLE DISCLOSING FINANCIAL ISSUES OR CHALLENGES AND CAN 
OPENLY SEEK HELP TO RESOLVE.

5.  FULLY UTILIZE LOCAL RESOURCES (PUBLIC AFFAIRS, FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT 
CENTERS, WARFIGHTER AND FAMILY SERVICE CENTERS, INSTALLATION BANKS AND CREDIT 
UNIONS, CHILD AND YOUTH PROGRAMS, SENIOR ENLISTED ADVISORS, SPOUSE 
ORGANIZATIONS, MILITARY BANKING AND CREDIT UNION LIAISON OFFICERS, AND THE 
INSTALLATION RELIEF SOCIETY) IN EVENT PLANNING. COMMANDS USE PUBLIC SERVICE 
ANNOUNCEMENTS, FLYERS, AND NEWS ARTICLES LOCATED ON THE MILITARY SAVES WEBSITE 
FOR PROMOTION OF THIS CAMPAIGN.

6. FINANCIAL READINESS IS EVERYONE'S JOB. OUR SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES 
DESERVE YOUR SUPPORT IN CREATING A CULTURE THAT ENDORSES SAVINGS AND FINANCIAL 
WELL BEING.
