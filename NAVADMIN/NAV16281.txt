RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN is the fourth in a series of NAVADMINs notifying the 
Navy of the Blended Retirement System (BRS) and financial literacy education 
requirements.  These requirements are designed to inform and educate Sailors 
and their families, as required by references (a) and (b) and supported by 
references (c) through (e), in order to make sound financial decisions.

2.  To support BRS Opt-in training in calendar year 2017, all financial 
educators fleet-wide must complete the BRS Financial Counselor and Educator 
Course no later than 30 January 2017.  The following actions are required:
     a.  Naval Education Training Command must ensure all life skills 
instructors complete training prior to deadline.
     b.  Commander, Navy Installation Command must ensure all Fleet and 
Family Support Center Personal Financial Managers complete training prior to 
deadline.
     c.  All commanders must ensure their assigned command financial 
specialists complete the required training prior to the deadline.

3.  The 60 minute course is available on Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) at 
http://jko.jten.mil/ (course #: J3OP-US1331).  The course is designed to 
equip financial educators with the tools necessary to provide Service Members 
with the information and education they need in order to choose which 
retirement system is right for them.

4.  All personnel in a leadership positions, especially command master 
chiefs, command career counselors, and others who offer career and 
professional development guidance are strongly encouraged to complete the 
course so they can more knowledgeably discuss the BRS with subordinates.

5.  All Sailors should be informed, as this course makes clear, no counselor, 
educator, or benefits advisor should tell them which retirement system they 
should choose.  The goal of BRS and financial literacy training is to ensure 
Sailors and their families have the information and resources they need to 
make their own financial decisions.

6.  Point of contact is Mr. James Stone, OPNAV N170C, at (901) 874-6949/DSN 
882 or via e-mail at NavyFinMgmt(at)navy.mil.

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded, 
whichever comes first.
