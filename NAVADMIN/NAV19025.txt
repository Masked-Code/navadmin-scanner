RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Advancement Examination Readiness Review 
(AERR) schedule from April to June 2019.  AERR events provide an opportunity

commands to impact sailorization by affecting the careers of every test taker 
in the Navy.  Selected chief, senior chief, and master chief petty officers 
on Active Duty, Full-Time Support, and Reservists currently on Active Duty 
for Special Work may take part in the process.  AERRs enable the Navy to 
advance the most qualified and rating-knowledgeable Sailors.

3.  In line with reference (b), Type Commanders (TYCOM)/rating sponsors will 
recruit rating Fleet Subject Matter Experts (FSME), select AERR attendees 
plus two alternate members, and provide names and contact information no less
