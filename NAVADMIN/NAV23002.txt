RMKS/1. The Naval History And Heritage Command (NHHC) is excited to announce 
the annual New Year's Day Deck Log Poem Contest for 2023 and calls for 
submissions by 2359 Eastern Daylight Time, 24 February 2023. 
 
2.  Celebratory congratulations to our winners from last year. 
First place: USS LAKE CHAMPLAIN (CG-57) written by ENS Sarah Weinstein. 
Second place: USS RUSSELL (DDG 59) written by LTJG Megan Stilley. 
Third place: USS CURTIS WILBUR (DDG 54) written by LT Austyn Sutton. 
 
Thank you to everyone that submitted entries for last year's contest. 
We look forward to reading your 2023 entries! 
 
3.  The deck log is the official record maintained by all commissioned U.S. 
Navy vessels.  While regulations normally restrict the types of entries in 
logbooks, the Navy has long held the tradition of the Midnight New Year's 
Poem. 
The first entry of the new year, written in verse, allows Sailors to express 
their creativity, experience of shipboard life, and pride in their command. 
To highlight this unique tradition, NHHC will host a New Year's Day Deck Log 
Poem Contest.  Sailors, we want to hear your voice. 
 
4.  Reviving aspects of our heritage like this time-honored tradition 
enhances our warfighting effectiveness.  As Chief of Naval Operations, 
Admiral Michael M. Gilday noted in FRAGO 1, as we focus on the future, we 
will value and celebrate our heritage.  Harkening back to our heritage 
connects us with the generations of Sailors that came before us, creating a 
sense of belonging and responsibility to uphold their legacy of valor and 
sacrifice. 
 
5.  The focus of this contest is to celebrate the voices of our Sailors and 
to preserve this Navy tradition.  The contest also reminds the fleet of the 
importance of the deck log as a historical document, one that preserves for 
future generations the actions and voices of our Sailors. 
 
6. Contest Details: 
a.  Deadline for submissions is 2359 eastern daylight time, 24 February 2023.
