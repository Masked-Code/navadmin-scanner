GENTEXT/SITUATION//

1. THIS NAVADMIN SUPERSEDES AND CANCELS REF A.

2. 13 OCT 2012 WILL MARK THE NAVY'S 237TH BIRTHDAY. BEGINNING WITH THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR NAVY IN 1775 AND CONTINUING TO OUR CURRENT MODERN FLEET, 
OUR NAVY HAS STOOD THE WATCH AS THE SHIELD OF THE REPUBLIC FOR MORE THAN TWO 
CENTURIES. THE AGE-OLD PRACTICE OF SOUNDING THE BELL DURING WATCHES, ON THE 
HOUR AND HALF HOUR, IS SYMBOLIC OF OUR NAVY'S HALLMARK EFFORTS AND IS AS 
APPROPRIATE IN OUR NUCLEAR AND MISSILE-ORIENTED NAVY AT THE DAWN OF THE 
TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY, AS IT EVER WAS. FROM OUR HISTORIC SAILING VESSELS IN THE 
LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY TO EVERY COMMAND TODAY, IT SIGNALS THAT SOMEONE STANDS 
THE WATCH. BELL RINGING SERVES AS A POWERFUL AND TANGIBLE REMINDER OF THE 
HISTORY, HERITAGE, AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF OUR NAVAL SERVICE AND IS INTENDED TO 
BE AN ENDURING TRADITION OF THE NAVY BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION. THIS ORDER PROVIDES 
GUIDANCE AND TASKS FOR THE GLOBAL EXECUTION AND PLANNING OF THIS IMPORTANT 
WEEK LONG COMMEMORATION IN SUPPORT OF OUR 13 OCTOBER BIRTHDAY.

3. THERE ARE TWO OCTOBER DATES OF SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE TO THE NAVY.
FIRST, "NAVY DAY," AN EXTERNAL OUTREACH EVENT, WAS PROPOSED IN 1922 BY THE NEW 
YORK NAVY LEAGUE. 27 OCT WAS THE DATE CHOSEN IN HONOR OF THE BIRTHDAY OF 
PRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT, THE SPONSOR OF THE MODERN PEACE-KEEPING NAVY, 
NOTED FOR HIS "BIG STICK DIPLOMACY" AND GREAT WHITE FLEET. SECOND, IN 1972 
ADMIRAL ELMO ZUMWALT, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS, ON THE ADVICE OF VICE ADMIRAL 
EDWIN B. HOOPER, DIRECTOR OF NAVAL HISTORY, DESIGNATED 13 OCT AS THE NAVY'S 
BIRTHDAY, RECOGNIZING THAT DATE IN 1775 WHEN THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS PASSED 
LEGISLATION AUTHORIZING THE CONSTRUCTION AND PURCHASE OF AMERICA'S FIRST NAVAL 
SHIPS. TODAY THE NAVY BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION ENCOMPASSES THE TRADITIONS OF 
HONORING THE UNITED STATES EMERGENCE AS A GREAT NAVAL POWER, AS WELL BEING AN 
INTERNAL SAILOR-FOCUSED COMMEMORATION.
