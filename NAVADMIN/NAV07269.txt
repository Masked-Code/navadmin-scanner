BECAUSE ONE OF THE CENTRAL IDEAS OF THE STRATEGY IS THE CRITICAL 
IMPORTANCE OF COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIPS IN THE MARITIME DOMAIN.  THE 
RESULT OF OVER A YEAR?S WORK AMONG THE NAVY, MARINE CORPS, AND COAST 
GUARD, THE STRATEGY SEEKS TO APPLY MARITIME POWER TO THE CRUCIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY OF PROTECTING OUR VITAL INTERESTS IN AN INCREASINGLY
