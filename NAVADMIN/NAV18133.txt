RMKS/1.  Reference (a) created an Additional Qualification Designator (AQD) 
to identify officers with experience on a Navy/Joint/Combined staff with 
significant expertise in interactions with Foreign Governments, Foreign 
Military, Foreign Academic Institutions or Non-Governmental Organizations 
(NGO).  The goal of establishing this AQD is to identify officers with 
enhanced regional and operational understanding that have direct experience 
working with foreign militaries and organizations who then are able to 
continue to progress to senior decision making levels within their 
communities.

2.  AQD awarding criteria is as follows:
    a.  Served as a member of a Navy/Joint or Combined Staff with significant 
expertise in interactions with Foreign Governments/Military/Academic

    b.  Served in the position for a minimum of 12 months in the rank of 
LCDR, CDR, CAPT or RDML.
    c.  Typical positions (not all encompassing):  Head of Naval Foreign 
Mission, Staff Theater Security Cooperation, International Affairs, Maritime 
Affairs, Senior Defense Official (SDO)/Defense Attache (DATT).  Primary 
duties involve advising U.S. or foreign staffs on military matters, 
functioning as a liaison for visiting U.S. forces/staffs, or serving as a 
foreign/coalition staff officer.
    d.  Serving on an OCONUS staff is insufficient justification for awarding 
the FE1 AQD.  The officer must have documented duties directly involving 
routine interaction with/support to non-U.S.
entities.

3.  Officers who have qualifying experience may self-nominate for the FE1 AQD 
by sending an application to their respective PERS-4X detailer.  Packages

fitness reports, awards, and any other relevant documentation of experience 
working directly with foreign militaries or organizations.  PERS-41, 42, 43,
