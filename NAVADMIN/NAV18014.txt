RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the cancellation of reference (a), updates 
references (b) and (c), and provides updated guidance on the management of 
Limited Duty Officers (LDO) assigned to off-ramp communities.  Active 
component (AC) LDOs in the Supply Corps (651X) and Information Warfare 
Community (IWC) (68XX) are designated for off-ramp as defined in enclosure 
(1) of reference (b).  Reference (d) announced changes to LDO and Chief 
Warrant Officer (CWO) officer summary groups (OSG) creating specific 
categories for Supply and IWC LDOs.  Reference (d) also stipulated that as 
the LDO and CWO Officer Sustainability Initiative (OSI) matures, promotion 
boards will begin considering LDOs and CWOs for promotion mirroring revised 
OSGs beginning with FY-21 promotions.  OSI eliminates control grade (LCDR, 
CDR and CAPT) authorizations for off-ramp designators.  In preparation for 
revised competitive categories, LDOs assigned to off-ramp designators will be 
managed under the following guidelines.
    a.  For Active Duty IWC LDOs who desire to redesignate without lateral 
transfer and redesignation board action, reference (b), paragraph 7, 
subparagraph h(4), sentence one, is updated to read, *Active Duty information 
warfare community LDOs in all grades into the restricted line (18XX) 
community are eligible on a case by case basis as part of the LDO and CWO 
sustainability initiative.* Without Board Action (WOBA) will be extended to 
off-ramp designated LDOs in the IWC after completion of 3 years commissioned 
service in line with reference (e).  Supply Corps LDOs will be considered for 
redesignation at 4 years commissioned service to ensure critical sea tours 
are completed.  To be eligible for WOBA, officers must possess a 
baccalaureate degree and be designated a Supply Corps Warfare or Information 
Warfare Officer as applicable.  Officers who have failed to select for the 
next higher grade are not eligible for redesignation.
    b.  Effective immediately, off-ramp designated LDOs who meet degree, 
warfare, and minimum commissioned service requirements of subparagraph 1a, 
may submit WOBA requests for redesignation to their Restricted Line (RL) or 
Staff Corps (SC) parent community.
    c.  Reference (c) is updated to provide off-ramp designated LDOs a 
maximum of 5 years commissioned service to complete educational and warfare 
requirements.  Probationary LDOs (those with less than 6 years commissioned 
service) failing to meet educational and warfare requirements prior to 5 
years commissioned service may be recommended for redesignation or assignment 
to the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR), on a case-by-case basis, via the 
Probationary Officer Continuation and Redesignation (POCR) Board.  In line 
with reference (f), members who do not meet requirements for transfer to the 
IRR- active status pool (ASP) may be subject to transfer to an inactive 
status (USNR-S2).

2.  Non-probationary officers (those with greater than 6 years of 
commissioned service) are highly encouraged to complete educational and 
warfare requirements and submit WOBA requests prior to convening the FY-21 
selection boards (January 2020).  Non-probationary officers, who do not 
redesignate or do not meet eligibility requirements, may be considered by a 
selective early retirement board under reference (g).

3.  Reserve component LDOs designated as off-ramp are encouraged to 
voluntarily apply for redesignation via the established change of designator 
process outlined in reference (h).  LDOs with 4 to 8 years of service are 
best suited due to career timing considerations.
IWC reserve redesignation is a continuous process and does not culminate in a 
specific board.  Reserve applicants must possess a baccalaureate degree, meet 
eligibility requirements of reference (h), and be designated as an 
Information Warfare or Supply Corps Warfare Officer as applicable.  LDOs 
failing to meet warfare requirements prior to 5 years commissioned service 
will be recommended for separation or assignment to the IRR on a case-by-case 
basis.
Members who do not meet requirements for transfer to the IRR-ASP may be 
subject to transfer to an inactive status (USNR-S2) in line with reference 
(i).
