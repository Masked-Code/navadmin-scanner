RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN informs eligible Service Members that the Blended 
Retirement System (BRS) mid-career continuation pay (CP) rates for calendar 
year (CY) 2023 have been released.  Please visit MyNavy Portal at https: 
//www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-
Services/21st-Century-Sailor/Family-Readiness/Personal-Financial-
Mgmt/ to view the CY-23 CP pay rates memorandum.

2.  In line with references (a) and (b), Service Members who want to receive 
the mid-career CP are reminded that they must be enrolled in BRS and request 
CP before 12 years of service (YOS).  The CP election is made via Navy 
Standard Integrated Personnel System
(NSIPS) which can be accessed via MyNavy Portal Quick Links.  For Service 
Members who have provided NSIPS with an up-to-date e-mail address, NSIPS will 
send an e-mail notification of CP eligibility at
11 years 6 months YOS, 11 years 9 months YOS and a final reminder at
11 years 11 months YOS.  Service Members who are unable to elect CP through 
NSIPS may manually elect CP through their command career counselor.  CP 
information to include details on electing CP can be found in references (c) 
and (d).  For any other CP issues, Service Members should reach out to MyNavy 
Career Center (MNCC) at 833-330- MNCC or askmncc(at)navy.mil.

3.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
