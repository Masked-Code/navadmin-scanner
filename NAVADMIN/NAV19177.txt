AMPN/REF A IS SECNAVINST 7220.88, AVIATION INCENTIVE PAYS AND BONUS 
PROGRAM.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Full-Time Support 
(FTS) Aviation Department Head Retention Bonus (ADHRB) Program.  A vital part 
of developing a total force strategy and maintaining combat readiness is to 
provide appropriate incentives to retain skilled personnel for critical naval 
aviation enterprise billets.  The FTS ADHRB Program provides selected bonuses 
as an incentive to eligible pilots and naval flight officers (NFO) serving in 
department head (DH) billets and to retain those officers through a post-DH 
aviation staff tour.

2.  The FY-19 FTS ADHRB Program continues the bonus system of previous years 
that is tied directly to force structure and targets initial eligible 
aviators.  Annual DH rates of up to $35,000 are listed below and vary by 
community.  DH retention bonuses will be paid in three or five equal annual 
installments depending on if the signed contract is received before or after 
completing 12 months of their initial DH tour.  The following are the rates 
for squadron department head contracts:
    HM  Pilot               $25,000/YR
    HSC  Pilot              $25,000/YR
    HSM  Pilot              $15,000/YR
    HT  Pilot               $15,000/YR
    VAQ - Pilot/NFO         $35,000/YR
    VFA/C - Pilot/NFO       $35,000/YR
    VP/VUP - Pilot/NFO      $25,000/YR
    VR  Pilot               $35,000/YR
    VT(JET) - Pilot/NFO     $35,000/YR
    VT(PROP) - Pilot/NFO    $25,000/YR

3.  For FY-19 only, officers currently serving in a DH tour that have not 
previously taken the FTS ADHRB because of previous ineligibility and are now 
beyond the 12 months into their initial DH tour may still be eligible for a 
5-year contract.  For FY-19 only, officers who took the FY-18 ADHRB and 
served as a DH in the squadron after 1 October 2018 are eligible to 
restructure the contract under the FY-19 rates.

4.  All signed contracts must be received by Navy Personnel Command, Full-
Time Support Distribution and Augmentation Branch (PERS-46) by
10 September 2019.  For specific details, eligibility and application 
procedures visit MyNavy Portal at https://my.navy.mil and then go to Quick 
Links, NPC website, Officer, Officer Detailing,

5.  The point of contact for this matter is LCDR Seth DiNola at
(901) 874-4146/DSN 882 or via e-mail at seth.dinola(at)navy.mil.

6.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
