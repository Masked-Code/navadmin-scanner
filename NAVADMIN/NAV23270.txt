RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the implementation of Dependent Care 
Flexible Spending Accounts (DCFSA) for Sailors on Active Duty or Reservists 
serving on Title 10 orders, in line with references (a) through (d).  The 
DCFSA is a pre-tax account used to pay for eligible dependent care services, 
such as pre-school, day camp, before or after-school programs, and child or 
adult daycare. Contributions are directly deposited from pay into a DCFSA 
before taxes are deducted, which reduces a member's taxable income. 
 
2.  Eligibility.  To be eligible for enrollment in a DCFSA, Sailors must be 
on Active Duty or be Reservists serving on Title 10 orders, and have eligible 
dependent care expenses that allow the Sailor and spouse to work, look for 
work, or attend school full-time.  For complete eligibility information, see 
https://finred.usalearning.gov/Benefits/DCFSA. 
 
3.  Enrollment: 
    a.  Eligible Sailors may enroll in a DCFSA for the 2024 plan during the 
Federal Open Season from 13 November through 11 December 2023.  Enrollment 
will be processed by the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program 
at https://fsafeds.com/explore/usmdcfsa.  A DCFSA enables participants to 
contribute $100-$5,000 per household per year in pre-tax income to pay for 
dependent care expenses ($2,500 if married and filing separate tax returns).   
A DCFSA operates on a calendar year basis, starting 1 January and ending 31 
December. 
    b.  Eligible Sailors may also enroll at any time in a DCFSA following a 
qualifying life event such as the birth or adoption of a child, a divorce, or 
a permanent change of station. 
    c.  Upon enrollment, the specified amount of funds will be withheld from 
the Sailors' biweekly paycheck beginning the 15th of the month for the 
effective year of eligibility (e.g., 15 January 2024) and deposited into 
their DCFSA. 
    d.  Funds are available in the Sailors' DCFSA after each pay period.   
Funds can be withdrawn to directly pay dependent care providers or to 
reimburse dependent care expenses paid out of pocket. 
    e.  Contributions should be carefully planned to not exceed the total 
amount of qualified expenses anticipated to be incurred during the year. 
    f.  There is a grace period through 15 March following the plan year 
(e.g., 15 March 2025 for those that enrolled for 2024 plan year) to incur 
expenses.  All claims must be submitted by 30 April following the plan year. 
    g.  Unclaimed contributions will be forfeited after 30 April following 
the plan year (e.g., 30 April 2025 for those enrolled in the 2024 federal 
plan year). 
    h.  Re-enrollment.  Eligible Sailors must re-enroll each year during the 
Federal Open Season to continue participation. 
 
4.  Things to consider before you enroll in DCFSA: 
    a.  Review your family's budget and cash flow.  Enrolling in a DCFSA will 
impact your take home pay. 
    b.  Understand your tax benefits.  Free tax software and one-on-one help 
from military tax experts are available to Service Members and their 
families. 
 
5.  DCFSA Resources.  Free assistance is available to help Sailors make the 
right decision, provide enrollment information, and understand how the DCFSA 
affects both their families' financial budget and tax situation.
