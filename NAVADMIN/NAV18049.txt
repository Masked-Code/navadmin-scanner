RMKS/1.  Congratulations to selectees of the FY-19 Navy Active-Duty Nuclear 
Limited Duty Officer (LDO) In-Service Procurement Board (ISPB).

2.  The FY-19 LDO/CWO ISPB was split into two separate boards per reference 
(a).  All nuclear rates applying for a commission as a Nuclear LDO 
(designator 620X) went before a board in November 2017. All other rates 
applying for a commission as non-Nuclear LDO/CWOs were considered in the 
LDO/CWO ISPB held in January 2018.  The results of that board will be 
released via a future NAVADMIN.

3.  For LDO selectees, read name, rate, commissioning month/year. All 
appointments are effective on the first day of the commissioning month.  
Members are directed to verify their select status via BUPERS Online.

4.  Each applicant should take pride in knowing that the superior performance 
documented in the evaluations reviewed by the board required the members to 
dedicate long hours in making hard choices to ensure only the best and fully 
qualified applicants were selected.  I am confident that the selectees will 
justify their selection time and again in their new careers as mustang 
officers. Those not selected are highly encouraged to seek out LDO 
mentorship. Bravo Zulu to all who were willing to answer the call.

5.  This message is not authority to issue appointments.  Frocking is 
prohibited.  COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806) will deliver appointments under 
separate correspondence approximately 60 days prior to the commissioning 
date.  Per reference (b), personnel selected for LDO with greater than 10 
years time in service at time of appointment will be offered permanent 
appointment to Ensign.

6.  Commanding officers are directed to:
    a.  Notify selectee.
    b.  Notify PERS-802 via official correspondence not later than 10 days 
following release of this message of selectees who do not accept appointment.  
Selectees who decline their commission within this 10 day period will be 
considered by the FY-19 Active-Duty Enlisted Advancement Selection Boards.  
After the 10 day period, PERS-802 will invalidate all FY-19 Navy Active-Duty 
Nuclear LDO selectees' eligibility for the FY-19 active-duty Enlisted 
Advancement Selection Boards.
    c.  Per reference (c), ensure LDO selectees obtain a commissioning 
physical within the 90 days preceding the appointment month.  Notify the 
Nuclear LDO detailer (PERS-422) upon completion.
    d.  Hold execution of all permanent change of station orders in abeyance, 
if applicable, and immediately notify PERS-40 of member's selection.
    e.  Administer official physical fitness assessment (PFA) within 4 months 
of commissioning date.  Selectees must hand carry test results to Officer 
Development School, Newport, RI.  If selectee fails to achieve satisfactory 
medium, notify the Nuclear LDO detailer (PERS-422).  Hold commissioning in 
abeyance until successful completion of PFA.
    f.  Hold appointment in abeyance if it is determined that a selectee is 
no longer mentally, physically, morally or professionally qualified or if 
they fail to meet current PFA requirements.  Immediately forward 
documentation citing reason to PERS-802.

7.  Nuclear LDO selectees who do not successfully complete a final technical 
interview will maintain their enlisted status and not be commissioned as 
LDOs.  Technical interviews will be scheduled by the Nuclear LDO detailer 
(PERS-422), and selectees will be notified via separate correspondence.

8.  If an LDO selectee's enlistment (including any extensions) expires after 
the date of appointment, they are not reenlistment eligible unless 
appointment is declined.

9.  Each selectee should contact the Nuclear LDO detailer (PERS-422) for 
specific requirements with regard to personal information and history cards 
and inform PERS-806 of address changes to facilitate appointment delivery.

10.  Point of contact for LDO/CWO In-Service Procurement Board selection 
result questions is the Nuclear LDO detailer (PERS-422), LT Michael Dahlgren,
