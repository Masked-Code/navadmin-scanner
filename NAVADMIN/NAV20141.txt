SUBJ/ACADEMIC YEAR 2020-2021 NAVAL WAR COLLEGE FLEET SEMINAR PROGRAM//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Naval War College (NWC) Fleet Seminar 
Program (FSP) which offers intermediate level Joint Professional Military 
Education (JPME-I) through a set of three courses: Strategy and War (S and 
W), Theater Security Decision Making (TSDM), Joint Maritime Operations (JMO), 
offered at multiple locations. Each course normally requires one academic 
year to complete, which runs from September through the following May. All 
three courses are not offered simultaneously at all locations.
There is no tuition fee and course materials are provided on a loan basis at 
no cost to the students.

2.  Background:
    a.  The NWC FSP will be offered in nineteen regional locations in the 
United States for academic year 2020-2021.  Planned locations and courses 
are:
        (1)  Annapolis, MD (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
        (2)  Dahlgren, VA (JMO)
        (3)  Everett, WA (S and W)
        (4)  Fort Worth, TX (S and W)
        (5)  Great Lakes, IL (TSDM)
        (6)  Jacksonville, FL (TSDM and JMO)
        (7)  Kitsap, WA (TSDM)
        (8)  Mayport, FL (S and W)
        (9)  Millington, TN (S and W)
        (10) New Orleans, LA (JMO)
        (11) Newport, RI (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
        (12) Norfolk, VA (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
        (13) Patuxent River, MD (TSDM)
        (14) Pearl Harbor, HI (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
        (15) Pensacola, FL (Whiting Field) (TSDM and JMO)
        (16) Port Hueneme, CA (TSDM)
        (17) San Diego, CA (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
        (18) Washington, DC (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
        (19) Whidbey Island, WA (JMO)

    b.  FSP courses are similar in content and delivery methodology to the 
intermediate level program of study offered by the resident College of Naval 
Command and Staff in Newport, RI.  Seminars for each course meet once a week 
in the evening for approximately 34 weeks, commencing in early September 2020 
and ending in May 2021. Successful completion of all three courses results in 
the award of a College of Naval Command and Staff diploma, as well as credit 
for JPME-I.  The FSP seminars at all locations are conducted in-step with 
each other so it is possible for a student who is transferring to or assigned 
temporary additional duty at another seminar location to attend class at that 
location.
