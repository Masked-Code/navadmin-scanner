COOPERATIVE STRATEGY FOR 21ST CENTURY SEAPOWER (MARITIME STRATEGY).
REF C IS THE NAVY LREC STRATEGY.//
RMKS/1.  AS WE HAVE SEEN IN RECENT HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE MISSIONS 
WITH USNS COMFORT IN LATIN AMERICA, THE USS PELELIU PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP 
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND USS FORT MCHENRYS ONGOING AFRICA PARTNERSHIP 
STATION EFFORT OFF WEST AFRICA, OUR MISSION EFFECTIVENESS OVERSEAS IS 
AS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY COMPREHEND OTHER CULTURES 
AND COMMUNICATE IN VERY DIVERSE ENVIRONMENTS AS IT IS ON FIREPOWER AND 
TECHNOLOGICAL SUPERIORITY.  BROAD AWARENESS OF FOREIGN CULTURES, 
FACILITY WITH LANGUAGES, AND EXPERTISE IN REGIONAL AFFAIRS IS ESSENTIAL 
TO EFFECTIVE INTERACTION WITH OUR DIVERSE INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS AND 
EMERGING FRIENDS.  THESE COMPETENCIES ARE KEY TO THEATER SECURITY 
COOPERATION, MARITIME DOMAIN AWARENESS, HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS, AND 
SHAPING AND STABILITY OPERATIONS.  THEY ARE A PREREQUISITE TO ACHIEVING 
THE INFLUENCE CALLED FOR IN REFS A AND B.  TO DEVELOP AND GALVANIZE 
THESE EFFORTS IN SUPPORT OF THE MARITIME STRATEGY, THE NAVYS FIRST-EVER 
LANGUAGE SKILLS, REGIONAL EXPERTISE, AND CULTURAL AWARENESS (LREC) 
STRATEGY (REF C) HAS BEEN APPROVED, PROMULGATED AND POSTED AT 
WWW.NAVY.MIL/MARITIME.
2.  THE VISION AND END-STATE SOUGHT BY THE STRATEGY IS:
    A.  SUFFICIENT LREC CAPACITY THAT MEETS NAVYS KNOWN MISSION NEEDS 
WITH APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF EXPERTISE, AND IS ABLE TO SURGE FOR EMERGENT 
REQUIREMENTS:
        (1) A TOTAL FORCE THAT APPRECIATES AND RESPECTS CULTURAL 
DIFFERENCES, AND RECOGNIZES THE RISKS AND CONSEQUENCES OF INAPPROPRIATE, 
EVEN IF UNINTENDED, BEHAVIOR IN FOREIGN INTERACTIONS.
        (2) A CADRE OF CAREER LANGUAGE PROFESSIONALS (I.E., FOREIGN 
AREA OFFICERS AND CRYPTOLOGIC TECHNICIANS (INTERPRETIVE)) WHOSE PRIMARY 
FUNCTIONS REQUIRE FOREIGN LANGUAGE SKILL AND REGIONAL EXPERTISE.
        (3) OTHER LANGUAGE-SKILLED SAILORS (I.E., PERSONNEL EXCHANGE 
PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS AND HERITAGE SPEAKERS) AND CIVILIANS WITH 
SUFFICIENT PROFICIENCY TO INTERACT WITH FOREIGN NATIONALS AT THE 
WORKING LEVEL.

        (4) A RESERVE CAPACITY OF ORGANIC FOREIGN LANGUAGE SKILL AND 
CULTURAL EXPERTISE THAT CAN BE CALLED UPON FOR CONTINGENCIES.
    B.  LREC CAPABILITIES ALIGNED WITH OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO 
SUPPORT JOINT AND NAVY MISSIONS UTILIZING THE TOTAL FORCE?ACTIVE, 
RESERVE, CIVILIAN AND CONTRACTOR?AND ENABLING NAVYS ABILITY TO SHAPE 
AND INFLUENCE THE MARITIME SECURITY ENVIRONMENT.
    C.  GIVEN THE TIME AND EXPENSE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE AND SUSTAIN THE 
CAPABILITY, AGILE, RESPONSIVE AND COST-EFFECTIVE LREC PLANS AND 
POLICIES THAT DELIVER RESULTS AT BEST VALUE WHILE MANAGING RISK.
    D.  LREC DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITY THAT MAXIMIZES EXISTING EDUCATION 
AND TRAINING INFRASTRUCTURE, EMBRACES NEW TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES, 
LEVERAGES THE HERITAGE AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY OF THE NAVY, AND REWARDS 
LINGUISTIC PROFICIENCY.
3.  THE LREC STRATEGY PROVIDES OVERARCHING GUIDANCE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT, 
ALIGNMENT, MANAGEMENT AND TRANSFORMATION OF THESE CAPABILITIES IN THE 
FORCE.  THIS CREATES A FRAMEWORK UNDER WHICH INVESTMENT DECISIONS WILL 
BE MADE, FURTHER FACILITATING OUR ABILITY
TO:
    A.  UNIFY DISPARATE LREC EFFORTS AND ALIGN CAPABILITIES PAGE 05 
RUCOMFB2551 UNCLAS CONSISTENT WITH EXTANT AND FUTURE STRATEGIC 
LANDSCAPES;
    B.  OPTIMIZE THE ALLOCATION OF LIMITED RESOURCES AND INTEGRATE LREC 
INTO NAVYS PLANNING, PROGRAMMING AND BUDGETING EXECUTION (PPBE) PROCESS, 
AND
    C.  GUIDE LREC DECISIONS IN SUPPORT OF POM-10 AND ACROSS THE FUTURE 
YEARS DEFENSE PLAN (FYDP).
4.  AN ASSOCIATED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, MUCH OF IT ALREADY IN EFFECT, 
HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY KEY LREC STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE NAVY AND WILL 
SOON BE PROMULGATED FORMALLY.
5.  AS THE MARITIME STRATEGY MAKES CLEAR, THE DEVELOPMENT AND 
SUSTAINMENT OF COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS 
PLACES A PREMIUM ON CULTURAL AWARENESS AND LINGUISITIC SKILL.  THE LREC 
STRATEGY IS OUR INITIAL ATTEMPT TO HARNESS WHAT WE HAVE AND TO DEVELOP 
WHAT WE NEED IN THIS INCREASINGLY CRITICAL AREA.
