KEY MEASURES I WILL USE TO ASSESS PROGRESS TOWARD ACCOMPLISHING MY 
INTENTIONS.  INCLUDED IN THIS YEAR?S GUIDANCE ARE SOME OF OUR 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN EXECUTING THE MARITIME STRATEGY OVER THE PAST YEAR; 
IT WAS WRITTEN WITH OUR COMMANDERS, SAILORS, AND CIVILIANS IN MIND.

DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS AND ENDURING VALUES THAT WE HOLD DEAR.

LEVELS TO ENSURE OUR NAVY IS WELL POSITIONED TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE TO

GUIDANCE WITH YOUR SHIPMATES. GO FORWARD WITH THE INNOVATION, CONFIDENT 
RISK-TAKING, AND CULTURE OF COMMAND THAT MAKE OUR NAVY THE WORLD?S 
FINEST.
