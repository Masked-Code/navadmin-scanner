RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the release of a Fleet-wide random 
selection Women's Uniform Survey.  Per ref (a), preliminary data 
collected during interviews, surveys and female focus groups in Fleet 
concentration areas indicated and confirmed a Fleet-wide random 
sampling survey of female Sailors (officer and enlisted) is warranted 
to obtain a broader base analysis of female uniform concerns and 
recommended solutions.

2.  Approximately 16,000 female Sailors (officers and enlisted) were 
randomly selected and asked to participate in a voluntary online 
survey.  Selected participants will be notified by mail of their 
selection and provided instructions on how to access and complete the 
survey online.  All selectees are encouraged to take part in the 
survey to provide Navy leadership a broad base analysis of female 
Sailor uniform preferences and concerns.  The online survey will be 
accessible for approximately 90 days upon release of this message.

3.  The Women's Uniform Survey is collaborative effort of the staff of 
Navy Personnel Research, Studies, and Technology (NPRST), the Navy's 
Uniform matters office (N131U), the Office of Women's Policy (N134),
