SUBJ/WISHING YOU A JOYOUS SEASON//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  WHETHER YOU CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS, HANUKAH OR
KWANZAA, PLEASE ACCEPT MY VERY BEST WISHES FOR A JOYOUS HOLIDAY
SEASON -- WITH A HOPE AND PRAYER THAT THE NEW YEAR FINDS YOU AND
YOUR LOVED ONES WELL.
2.  I NEED NOT REMIND YOU OF ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE DOING TO SOW THE
SEEDS OF FREEDOM.  YOU KNOW THEM WELL.  BUT, I WOULD BE REMISS IF I
DID NOT THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND FOR YOUR DEDICATION TO THE
TASK.  AT SEA AND ASHORE, IN FAR-OFF PLACES AND HERE AT HOME, YOU
ARE MAKING LIFE BETTER AND SAFER FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THE WORLD
OVER.  PLEASE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE YOUR NATION S AND YOUR NAVY S
DEEPEST GRATITUDE.
3.  I WOULD ASK ONLY THREE THINGS OF YOU OVER THE HOLIDAYS: 1) TAKE
CARE OF YOURSELVES -- WHETHER YOU ARE TRAVELING HOME OR FORWARD
DEPLOYED, PLEASE STAY SAFE; 2) TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILIES -- LET
THEM KNOW HOW MUCH YOU APPRECIATE THEIR LOVE AND SUPPORT; AND 3)
TAKE CARE OF YOUR SHIPMATES -- SET A PLACE AT YOUR TABLE FOR SOMEONE
WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE SPENDING THE HOLIDAYS ALONE.  THESE ARE GREAT
GIFTS.
4.  FINALLY, MAY YOU LOOK BACK WITH PRIDE AT YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS
THIS YEAR -- AND THERE WERE MANY -- WHILE LOOKING FORWARD WITH
CONFIDENCE AND COURAGE TO THE CHALLENGES AHEAD IN 2006.  SAFE
SAILING AND ALL THE BEST.
