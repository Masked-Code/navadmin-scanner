Advancement Selection Boards for command master chief (CMDCM), master chief 
petty officer (E-9) and senior chief petty officer (E-8) (Cycle 253).  The

Reserve Component (RC) E-8 and E-9 (in rate) boards will consider FTS and 
SELRES personnel.  Mobilized Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) personnel are 
considered under the SELRES requirements for advancement.

6.  Eligibility Criteria.  Candidates must meet the eligibility requirements 
outlined in chapters 2 and 11 of reference (a) and this NAVADMIN prior to the 
scheduled board convening date.  All requirements must reflect in the EMF for 
Active Duty and FTS or IMAPMIS for SELRES prior to the board 
convening.  Requirements achieved or posted to the record of the candidate 
after the scheduled board convening date are considered late and will not 
make a candidate eligible for the regularly scheduled board or entitle a 
candidate to an enlisted special selection board.  Refer to paragraph 616 of 
reference (a) for E-8 and E-9 candidate validation procedures.  Eligibility 
requirements include: 
    a.  The name of the candidate appears on the selection board eligibility 
list in the correct competitive group on their profile sheet.  Candidates 
should register for e-mail notification for profile sheet updates via MNP at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/my-
advancement.  Select My Profiles, then Advancement Profile Sheet- 
Individuals.  Candidates and commands share equal responsibility to ensure 
the eligibility list is accurate.  Because eligibility status can change 
without direct notification, candidates should verify their profile sheet on 
a continuous basis and commands must verify their ESVR weekly through the 
projected board adjourn date. 
    b.  In line with reference (a), the terminal eligibility date used to 
compute the time in rate (TIR) is 1 October 2022.  The TIR date for E-8 
candidates must be on or before 1 September 2019.  The TIR date for E-9 
candidates must be on or before 1 July 2019. 
    c.  High year tenure (HYT) waivers must be approved prior to the board 
convening.  HYT date or approved HYT waivers for the current paygrade must be 
1 July 2022 or later.  Candidates who will be at HYT on 1 July 2022 for the 
next higher paygrade are ineligible for advancement, regardless of any 
approved HYT waiver. 
    d.  Commands must revalidate members whose disapproved or cancelled 
retirement authorization is adjudicated prior to the selection board 
convening date by sending an e-mail with the reason for revalidation to the 
Selection Board Eligibility Branch (PERS-802).  See paragraph 208 of 
reference (a) for Fleet Reserve request impacts to eligibility. 
    e.  Security clearance requirements.  See paragraph 203 of reference 
(a).  Ratings requiring a security clearance are AC, AE, AG, AO, AT, AWF, 
AWO, AWR, AWS, AWV, AZ, CTI, CTM, CTN, CTR, CTT, EOD, ET, FC, FCA, GM, HT, 
IC, IS, IT, LN, MA, MC, MN, ND, OS, QM, SB, SO, STG AND YN, as well as all 
nuclear and submarine ratings. 
    f.  Rate specific and competitive group eligibility 
requirements.  Candidates must meet special requirements for certain ratings, 
as outlined in paragraph 203 of reference (a).  Commands must verify and 
submit a message formatted e-mail to Naval Education and Training 
Professional Development Center (NETPDC) N321 and PERS-802 requesting 
invalidation of those selection board eligible candidates who no longer meet 
the rate specific and competitive group qualifications by the scheduled board 
convening date. 
    g.  Non-nuclear submarine Sailors must be designated as either SS, SU OR 
SQ in line with reference (b) as of the board convening date to be 
eligible.  Candidates designated as SG or SP are not eligible for 
advancement. 
    h.  While reference (c) required personnel who were selected for 
E-8 in FY-17 and FY-18 to successfully graduate from the Senior Enlisted 
Academy (SEA) to be eligible for E-9 board consideration, increased 
throughput requirements made this unachievable.  Until further notice, this 
requirement is held in abeyance.  Reference (c) will be revised with guidance 
for SEA requirements in future selection boards. 
 
7.  Competitive Groups.  The below listed ratings are separated into 
competitive groups as applicable to the component of the candidate:
