RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN promulgates the Chief of Naval Operations Mission 
Assurance Assessment (CNO-MAA) schedule for FY18 that has been coordinated 
with Navy component commands, Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) 
and respective Regions.  Changes to the schedule must be coordinated through 
CNIC, the respective Navy component commander, and Director, Installation 
Operations Branch (OPNAV N462).  Official dates are released via SIPRnet due 
to operation security concerns.

2.  Reference (a) provides the mission assurance (MA)-centric framework 
focused on ensuring resilience for the capabilities and assets supporting 
Navy core functions, using a risk management process across all protection 
and resilience programs.  References (b) and (c) direct the integration of 
all higher headquarters vulnerability assessments under the MAA program.  
This integration consists of a criticality assessment, threat and hazard 
assessment, and vulnerability assessment covering the following programs:  
antiterrorism, continuity of operations, cybersecurity, defense critical 
infrastructure, emergency management, energy security, law enforcement, 
physical security, and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high-
yield explosive preparedness.

3.  MAAs, conducted by the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, consist 
of three phases.  Phase I is the mission analysis (threat-hazard assessment, 
mission identification and analysis, and assessment planning).  This phase 
includes an on-site visit, and serves to focus the efforts of the assessment 
team.  The overall objective of mission analysis is to gain an understanding 
of the missions executed by a command, as well as how they are being 
executed.  The output of this analysis will identify an inventory of assets 
and supporting infrastructure and systems associated with the execution of 
each mission or task assigned to a command.  This asset inventory represents 
a starting point for the execution of the critical asset identification 
process as required per reference (d).  Mission analysis must involve close 
coordination between tenant commands and host installations.  Utility 
security analysis (USA) also occurs during Phase I.  These assessments 
generate analyses on utility profiles of those missions, functions, and 
assets supported by internal and external utility sources.  The profile 
analysis includes determination of gaps or deficiencies in delivery of 
reliable, secure, and resilient utilities to support those missions and 
assets.  There are two main objectives of the USA:

     a.  Identify and assess utility infrastructure (power, water,
     communications, etc.) and control systems (industrial control,
     building control, and utility control) that support installation
     and tenant command mission execution.
     b.  Identify gaps in utility technology infrastructure that
     support the execution of missions, functions and core
     capabilities.

4.  Phase II is the risk assessment, conducted on-site, utilizing combined 
benchmarks which add Navy policy into the Joint Staff required policies 
outlined in reference (e).  A risk assessment involves the collection and 
evaluation of the following data to determine the overall risk posture to 
missions, assets and supporting infrastructure:  (1) asset criticality based 
on mission impacts; (2) probable threats and hazards specific to the 
installation; and, (3) degree of vulnerability.  A risk assessment involves a 
systematic, rational, and defensible process for identifying, quantifying, 
and prioritizing risks.

5.  Phase III is the risk management process; a standardized process to 
manage risk and enable decision making that balances risk and cost with 
assuring the mission.  Risk management allows the commander to decide how 
best to employ allocated resources to reduce risk, or, where circumstances 
warrant, request additional resources, waivers to policy or acceptance of the 
identified risk.  This process starts by directing the assessed installation 
and associated tenant commands to coordinate on the completion of the 
corrective action plan, on identified vulnerabilities, within 120 days of 
receipt of the final report.  The corrective action plan will be socialized 
and endorsed by each office within the assessed installation and tenant 
commands chain-of-command and ultimately coordinated with CNIC, Navy 
component commands and OPNAV resource sponsors to prioritize projects with 
unacceptable risk to missions and capabilities.

6.  CNO-MAAs and USAs will be conducted on the following installations:
Commander Fleet Activities Chinhae
Commander Fleet Activities Yokosuka
Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling
Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story
Naval Air Facility Atsugi
Naval Air Station Jacksonville
Naval Air Station Lemoore
Naval Air Station Oceana
Naval Air Station Pensacola
Naval Air Station Whiting Field
Naval Base Ventura County
Naval Shipyard Portsmouth (New Hampshire)
Naval Station Crane
Naval Station Everett
Naval Station Mayport
Naval Station Rota
Naval Support Activity Annapolis
Naval Support Activity Hampton Roads
Naval Support Activity Mechanicsburg
Naval Support Activity Saratoga Springs
Naval Support Facility Carderock
Naval Support Facility Suitland
Naval Weapons Station Earle

7.  Utility security assessments (no CNO-MAA) will be conducted on the 
following installation: Naval Magazine Indian Island

8.  Joint Staff assessments led by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) 
will be conducted at the following locations:
Naval Magazine Indian Island
Naval Support Activity Bahrain
Schriever Air Force Base
Wahiawa Annex, Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam

9.  A Director, Shore Readiness Division (OPNAV N46)-led mobile training team 
(MTT) will provide MA training on the current MA process and methodology to 
include assessment tools, Navy Critical Asset Management System (NAV-CAMS) 
and the risk management process.  NAV-CAMS supports the analysis and 
documentation of criticality assessments, missions and mission impacts, basic 
elements of information, all hazards threat assessments and the vulnerability 
assessment of assets linked to threats and hazards to produce a standardized 
risk rating.  NAV-CAMS is the Navy’s authoritative task critical asset 
repository and risk management database of record.

10.  MA training will be hosted at the following locations for calendar year 
2017.  There are 30 seats available per session. 

Naval Air Station Jacksonville	   04-07 December 2017
Commander Fleet Activities Yokosuka	   12-15 February 2018
Training POC is Ms. Erin Breen:  erin.breen.ctr@navy.mil

11.  Official notification letters, and specific assessment requirements 
(e.g., list of required documents and on-site logistics requirements) will be 
sent via separate correspondence.
