COLLABORATION CAPABILITIES SHALL BE MAXIMIZED AND CONSIDERED AS THE 
FIRST CHOICE WHEN CONDUCTING MEETINGS OR IN-HOUSE TRAINING ACTIVITIES.
VTC PROCUREMENT AND SERVICE USE SHALL BE IMPLEMENTED AS FOLLOWS:
(1) REMOVE/ELIMINATE SHORE-BASED DESKTOP SECRET INTERNET PROTOCOL ROUTER
NETWORK (SIPRNET)/NON-CLASSIFIED INTERNET PROTOCOL ROUTER NETWORK

THESE VTC'S TO BE OF NO USE, OR UNLESS OTHER COLLABORATION TOOLS ARE 
PROVEN SUFFICIENT. 
(5)  THE PURCHASE OF DESKTOP CAMERAS FOR ONLINE COLLABORATION WILL BE
LIMITED TO THE SAME RATIO OF CURRENT TANDBERG OR DESKTOP STAND ALONE VTC
UNITS IN USE BY EACH COMMAND OR ACTIVITY. MOREOVER, THEIR COST WILL NOT
EXCEED PREVIOUS MAINTENANCE OR INSTALLATION COSTS.  CAMERA INSTALLATION

ENSURE NETWORK HEALTH AND COMPLIANCE.   
(6) VTC/DESKTOP EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES SHALL BE PROCURED IAW REF F.

DEVICES, AFFECTED USERS SHALL UTILIZE THE "TETHERING" OPTION (PHONE 
AS A MODEM) WHEN AVAILABLE, INSTEAD OF AIR CARDS.  ECH II COMMANDS WILL

125 PERCENT OF THE CONTRACTED PLAN MINUTES.
(4) CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS (COOP).  CELLULAR DEVICES MAINTAINED
