SUBJ/2019 VICE ADMIRAL JAMES BOND STOCKDALE LEADERSHIP AWARD WINNERS//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the 2019 recipients of the Vice Admiral 
James Bond Stockdale Leadership Award.  Commander Patrick OLoughlin, 
Commanding Officer, USS FORREST SHERMAN (DDG 98)(U.S. Fleet Forces) and 
Commander Carl Trask, Commanding Officer, USS CONNECTICUT (SSN 22)(U.S. 
Pacific Fleet) were selected for their inspirational leadership.

2.  This fleet award was established in honor of VADM James Bond Stockdale, 
whose distinguished naval career symbolized the highest standards of 
excellence in both personal example and leadership. The award is presented 
annually to two commissioned officers on active duty in the grade of 
commander or below who are serving in command of a single ship, submarine, 
aviation squadron, Sea, Air, and Land (SEAL) team, naval special warfare 
squadron, SEAL delivery vehicle team, special boat team, explosive ordnance 
disposal mobile unit, mobile diving and salvage unit or Navy special 
clearance team during the nomination cycle.  Candidates are nominated by 
peers who themselves must be eligible for the award.

3.  The 2019 winners were chosen from among six outstanding finalists in a 
review process that included screening at the fleet commander level and final 
selection by a board of senior officers.

4.  The following finalists deserve well-earned congratulations:
    a.  U.S. Pacific Fleet finalists:
        (1) CDR Sean P. Lewis, Commanding Officer,
            USS STERETT (DDG 104).
        (2) CDR Corey Poorman, Commanding Officer,
            USS PASADENA (SSN 752).
        (3) CDR Steven J. Shauberger, Commanding Officer, Electronic
            Attack Squadron ONE THREE FIVE (VAQ-135).
     b.  U.S. Fleet Forces finalist:
         (1) CDR Troy Tartaglia, Commanding Officer, Patrol Squadron
             ONE SIX (VP-16).

5.  CDR Patrick OLoughlin and CDR Carl Trask, as well as all nominees, should 
be justifiably proud of their achievements.

6.  Awards will be presented at a ceremony to be determined at a later date.

7.  This NAVADMIN will be kept for record purposes and will remain in effect 
until canceled or superseded.
