RMKS/1.  PER REF A, STARTING 1 NOVEMBER 2010, THE OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY 
OPERATIONS (OCO) SUPPORT ASSIGNMENT (OSA) PROGRAM WILL REPLACE THE GSA 
DETAILING PROCESS FOR ENLISTED SAILORS.  THE OFFICER GSA PROCESS WILL 
CONTINUE TO WORK IN PARALLEL WITH THE INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION MANPOWER 
MANAGEMENT (IAMM) PROCESS TO MEET ACTIVE COMPONENT (AC) OFFICER IA 
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  THIS NAVADMIN UPDATES OFFICER 
GSA BUSINESS RULES AND SUPERCEDES REFS B AND C.

2.  GSA BUSINESS RULES:  GSA DETAILING NORMALIZES THE IA ASSIGNMENT 
PROCESS BY USING THE EXISTING DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM TO FILL AC IA 
REQUIREMENTS.  UNLIKE THE IAMM ASSIGNMENT PROCESS, GSA DETAILING 
PROVIDES OFFICERS THE OPTION OF FILLING IA ASSIGNMENTS IN A PREDICTABLE 
WINDOW AT THEIR REGULAR PROJECTED ROTATION DATE (PRD).
    A.  GSA ORDERS:
       (1) ONCE IDENTIFIED FOR A GSA, OFFICERS WILL RECEIVE PERMANENT 
CHANGE OF STATION (PCS) ORDERS TO EXPEDITIONARY COMBAT READINESS CENTER 
FORWARD (ECRC) SAN DIEGO, CA, OR NORFOLK, VA.  ALL ECRC FWD UICS ARE 
DESIGNATED TAC C/TYPE TWO SEA DUTY.  GSA TOUR LENGTHS VARY, BUT THE 
STANDARD PCS DURATION FOR A GSA IS BETWEEN SIX AND 14 MONTHS.
       (2) CONCURRENTLY, OFFICERS WILL RECEIVE TDY ORDERS FROM 
COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4G3) DETACHING THEM FROM ECRC FWD FOR TRAINING, 
TRANSPORTATION AND DEPLOYMENT (OCONUS) IN A TEMPORARY DUTY (TEMADD) 
STATUS FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION OF THEIR PCS ASSIGNMENT.  OFFICERS CAN 
VIEW TEMADD ORDERS ON BUPERS ONLINE (BOL):
           (A) LOG ONTO BUPERS ONLINE AT HTTPS://BOL.NAVY.MIL/;
           (B) SELECT THE "NMCMPS" LINK OR "VIEW IA ORDERS" LINK; AND
           (C) CLICK "VIEW MY ORDERS" IN UPPER MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN.
    B.  GSA PRE-SCREENING REQUIREMENTS.  ALL GSA SAILORS REQUIRER 
MEDICAL, DENTAL, AND PERSONNEL SUITABILITY SCREENING PER THE 
EXPEDITIONARY SCREENING CHECKLIST POSTED  ON HTTP://WWW.IA.NAVY.MIL 
WITHIN 30 DAYS OF TEMADD/ITDY ORDERS  DTG.  DEPENDENT SCREENING IS NOT 
REQUIRED.
    C.  GSA DETAILING ADMINISTRATION:
       (1) DETAILERS WILL INFORM OFFICERS OF AVAILABLE GSA ASSIGNMENTS 
DURING NORMAL ORDER NEGOTIATION WINDOWS, WHICH CAN VARY DEPENDING UPON 
THE UNIQUE CAREER PATH REQUIREMENTS OF EACH OFFICER COMMUNITY.
       (2) CONSISTENT WITH NORMAL DETAILING PRACTICES, AUXILLIARY 
NOMINATIONS WILL NOT BE IDENTIFIED FOR GSA REQUISITIONS.  IF A GSA 
SELECTEE FALLS OUT GREATER THAN 120 DAYS BEFORE FIRST I-STOP, DETAILERS 
WILL ATTEMPT TO REPLACE THE UNPLANNED LOSS.  IF FALLOUT OCCURS AT 120 
DAYS OR LESS BEFORE THE FIRST I-STOP, COMNAVPERSCOM SHALL ATTEMPT TO 
FIND A REPLACEMENT FILL WITHIN 48 HOURS AND, IF UNABLE TO FIND A 
REPLACEMENT, THE REQUIREMENT WILL PASS TO USFF FOR IAMM SOURCING.
       (3) OFFICERS WHO OPT FOR GSA ORDERS WILL BE CONSIDERED VOLUNTEERS 
FOR THOSE ORDERS AND WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE WAIVED FOR DWELL/ITEMPO 
REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED IN OPNAVINST 3000.13C.
    D.  FOLLOW-ON DETAILING:
       (1) POST GSA DEPLOYMENTS.  OFFICERS WHO HAVE FOLLOW-ON SEA DUTY 
ORDERS SUBSEQUENT TO A GSA DEPLOYMENT WILL BE CONSIDERED VOLUNTEERS FOR 
THOSE ORDERS AND WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE WAIVED FOR DWELL/ITEMPO 
REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED IN OPNAVINST 3000 .13C.
       (2) AS SOON AS THE OFFICER IS GAINED BY ECRC FWD, FOLLOW-ON 
ORDERS TO THE NEXT DUTY ASSIGNMENT MAY BE ISSUED CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT 
NPC ORDERS RELEASE GUIDANCE.
      (3) DEPENDING ON SPECIFIC OFFICER COMMUNITY DETAILING WINDOWS, 
OFFICERS WITH GSA ASSIGNMENTS OF MORE THAN NINE MONTHS MAY HAVE TO WAIT 
TO NEGOTIATE FOLLOW-ON ORDERS UNTIL THEY HAVE EXECUTED THE GSA AND ARE 
IN THEATER.

3.  AS COMMUNITY-SPECIFIC INVENTORY AND BILLET CONSTRAINTS ALLOW, 
OFFICERS COMPLETING A GSA TOUR FROM A SHORE SLATE WILL RECEIVE THE 
FOLLOWING UPON RETURN FROM IA DEPLOYMENT:
    A.  THE FLEET-CONCENTRATION AREA OR HOMEPORT (IF AVAILABLE) OF THEIR 
CHOICE.
    B.  IF DESIRED, DETAILING INDEPENDENT FROM THE STANDARD COMPETITIVE 
SLATING PROCESS; ORDERS WILL BE DEVELOPED INDIVIDUALLY IN A ONE-ON-ONE 
CONSTRUCT.
    C.  FOR FUTURE SLATES, IA "SLATING CREDIT," WHICH RANKS AN OFFICER 
WHO HAS COMPLETED AN IA ASSIGNMENT ABOVE PEERS WITH SIMILAR 
QUALIFICATIONS/FITNESS REPORTS.
    D.  UNLESS A VOLUNTEER FOR ANOTHER IAMM OR GSA, THE OFFICER WILL 
HAVE TOTAL INDEMNITY FROM ANOTHER IA TOUR FOR THE THREE YEARS FOLLOWING 
IA SERVICE.  DESIGNATORS THAT DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT INVENTORY TO 
SUPPORT A THREE-YEAR EXCLUSION WILL BE HANDLED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.

4.  GSA SAILORS ARE ENTITLED TO MOVE DEPENDENTS TO THE NEW DUTY STATION 
(ECRC SAN DIEGO, CA OR ECRC NORFOLK, VA, AS APPROPRIATE) OR TO LEAVE 
THEM AT THEIR CURRENT PERMANENT DUTY STATION (PDS).  DUE TO STATUS OF 
FORCES AGREEMENTS (SOFA) WITH HOST NATIONS, MEMBERS AT FOREIGN OCONUS 
DUTY STATIONS MAY NOT BE AUTHORIZED TO LEAVE DEPENDENTS IN PLACE AT THE 
CURRENT PERMANENT DUTY STATION (PDS).  IF DEPENDENTS STAY AT THE FOREIGN 
OCONUS DUTY STATION, THEY MAY NOT BE COVERED BY THE SOFA EVEN IF 
OTHERWISE AUTHORIZED TO STAY. DEPENDENTS REMAINING AT CURRENT DUTY 
STATION MAY BE ENTITLED TO RETAIN MILITARY HOUSING AND BAH ENTITLEMENTS 
BASED ON CURRENT CONUS PDS OR DEPENDENT LOCATION.  SEE REF (F) FOR 
DETAILS.

5.  OFFICERS UNDER IA ORDERS THAT REQUIRE 210 DAYS OR MORE AWAY FROM PDS 
ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ITDY ORDERS ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.  FOR OFFICERS WITH 
GSA ORDERS, THE PDS IS DEFINED AS THE ECRC FWD LOCATION LISTED ON THE 
MEMBER'S PCS ORDERS.  OFFICERS WHO MEET THE 210-DAY REQUIREMENT AND HAVE 
NOT EXECUTED THEIR TDY ORDERS AND REQUIRE MOVEMENT OF DEPENDENTS TO AN 
ALTERNATE PLACE OF RESIDENCE SHOULD CONTACT PERS-4G3 AT IAHHG@NAVY .MIL 
FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  REQUESTS MUST INCLUDE THE NOBLE EAGLE (NE) 
NUMBER PROVIDED UNDER BILLET INFORMATION IN THE OFFICER'S ORIGINAL TDY 
ORDERS.

6.  THE NAVY REMAINS COMMITTED TO RECOGNIZING AND SUPPORTING OUR IA 
OFFICERS AND FINDING THE BEST BALANCE BETWEEN IA MISSION REQUIREMENTS, 
OFFICER DESIRES AND COMMAND READINESS. WHILE EVERY EFFORT WILL BE MADE 
TO EXECUTE GSA BUSINESS RULES AS PUBLISHED IN THIS NAVADMIN AND POSTED 
AT HTTP://WWW.IA.NAVY.MIL, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT 
CANNOT BE ANTICIPATED AND WILL REQUIRE TAILORED SOLUTIONS NOT COVERED IN 
CURRENT BUSINESS RULES.

7.  YOUR SUPPORT REMAINS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THE NAVY PROVIDES THE 
RIGHT OFFICER WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS AT THE RIGHT TIME TO MEET OUR 
NATION'S OCO REQUIREMENTS.
