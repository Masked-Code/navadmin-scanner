RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits applications for the Navy Flight 
Demonstration Squadron (NFDS) Blue Angels 2015 season.  Enlisted applications 
for this challenging and rewarding tour of duty can be submitted immediately; 
however, they must be postmarked NLT 2 May 2014.  The NFDS "Blue Angels" is 
the Navy's premier showcase for naval aviation and they are back to flying 
for the remainder of the 2014 season.  Annually, the Blue Angels fly more 
than 300 flights around the U.S. in air shows demonstrating the exceptional 
abilities of naval aviation.  The Blue Angels will be on the road and in the 
air, and need the best ground maintenance team our Navy has to offer.  
Personnel selected for this unique and demanding duty represent the hundreds 
of thousands of Sailors serving throughout the U.S. and abroad.  Selection 
results will be available NLT June 2014.  Personnel with a projected rotation 
date of September 2014 through April 2015 are eligible and encouraged to
