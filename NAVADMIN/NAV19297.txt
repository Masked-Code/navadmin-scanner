RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the expansion of the Government Travel 
Charge Card (GTCC) pilot program and provides updated policy and guidance for 
the use of the GTCC during Permanent Change of Station (PCS) travel.  
Expanding use of the GTCC for PCS travel is another PCS move initiative 
designed to improve the PCS experience for Sailors and their families as part 
of Navy’s ongoing transformation efforts for a modernized pay and personnel 
system under Sailor 2025.

2.  Effective upon release of this NAVADMIN, all Active-Duty Sailors 
conducting Continential U.S. (CONUS) or Outside CONUS PCS moves, single or 
traveling concurrently or non-concurrently with dependents and with 45 days 
or less Temporary Duty Under Instruction en route are authorized to use the 
GTCC in accordance with reference (b).
NOTE:  For Sailors choosing to use the GTCC for PCS travel and traveling non-
currently with dependents, it is recommended that the Sailor use the GTCC and 
request a travel advance for dependent travel via the existing process.  When 
traveling non-concurrently, the GTCC may only be used by the Sailor and not 
their dependents.

3.  The pilot program remains for Active-Duty Navy only, with the following 
exclusions:
    a.  Accession, separation or retirement orders
    b.  Civilian personnel
    c.  Selected Navy Reserve
    d.  Individual Mobilization Augmentee
    e.  Individual Ready Reserve Navy

4.  Applying lessons learned and incorporating Fleet feedback since Phase One 
commenced in August, Sailors choosing to use the GTCC for PCS travel are 
reminded to take the following steps prior to detaching and executing orders:
    a.  Verify receipt of your GTCC
    b.  Meet with the Command Pay and Personnel Administrator (CPPA) to 
review travel entitlements
    c.  Verify the command Agency Program Coordinator (APC) has activated 
your GTCC and placed the card in a PCS Mission Critical status to ensure 
sufficient funds are made available during your PCS travel
    d.  Verify your PIN for GTCC

5.  Use of the GTCC is not authorized for procurement of commercial airfare.  
All commercial airfare for PCS travel will be booked through the Navy 
Passenger Transportation Office.  GTCC policy and procedural guidance and 
cardholder and command responsibilities can be found in paragraphs 46 of 
reference (b).

6.  At any point during the PCS process, Sailors who experience problems with 
their GTCC have three options for assistance:
    a.  Contact their detaching command APC
    b.  Contact the MyNavy Career Center at 833-330-MNCC (6622) or via e-mail 
at askmncc(at)navy.mil
    c.  Contact Citibank 24/7 from anywhere in the world using the phone 
numbers on the back of the card

7.  In line with reference (c), Sailors can access their PCS orders, as well 
as submit travel vouchers using a desktop computer or the MyPCS Mobile 
application.  The MyPCS Mobile application operates on both Android and Apple 
products and is available from the Navy Application Locker at 
https://www.applocker.navy.mil or via MyNavy Portal at https://my.navy.mil.

8.  To evaluate program effectiveness, Sailor satisfaction and collect 
feedback for continued improvements, GTCC pilot program participants are 
strongly encouraged to complete a brief survey available at 
https://surveys.max.gov/index.php/737856?lang=en.
