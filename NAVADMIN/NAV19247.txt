RMKS/1.  In line with Sailor 2025 efforts to modernize personnel management, 
this NAVADMIN revises guidance for completing Joint Professional Military 
Education (JPME) Phase I prior to assuming commander (O-5) command.

2.  Reference (a), requiring Unrestricted Line (URL) officers to complete 
JPME Phase I prior to assuming any commander command is canceled.  Effective 
immediately, all URL officers must complete JPME Phase I prior to assuming O-
5 command for which the command-at-sea insignia is authorized, as outlined in 
reference (b).

3.  This policy change aligns Navys talent management strategy with the need 
to develop critical thinkers and dynamic leaders in an era of Great Power 
Competition.  The goal is to man the Fleet with the right Officers, 
possessing the right education, at the right time.

4.  JPME develops officers with a broad depth of knowledge and problem-
solving skills, enhancing Navys ability to deliver maritime superiority 
across the spectrum of high-end conflict in support of the Combatant 
Commanders.  We strongly encourage all URL, RL and Staff Corps officers to 
seek available options to achieve JPME (e.g. in-residence, distance learning, 
Fleet Seminar Program).  Officers should discuss JPME opportunities with 
their detailers and establish a plan to complete this important professional 
requirement consistent with their career goals.  Information on JPME may be 
found under Other Education Programs and Naval War College Programs sections 
of the MyNavy Portal at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/training-education-
qualifications/e-graduate-education-and-fellowship-programs.

5.  Waivers with the Type Commanders endorsement will be considered for 
approval by the Chief of Naval Personnel.

6.  Please direct any questions or concerns via email at 
ALTN.N127(at)navy.mil.

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
