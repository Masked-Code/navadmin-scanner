POC/OPNAV/CAPT STEVEN TARR III, (703) 614-9250//EMAIL: 
STEVEN.TARR1.MIL(AT)US.NAVY.MIL 
 
RMKS/ 1.  Purpose.  This NAVADMIN provides updated COVID-19 standardized 
operational guidance and cancels and replaces references (A) and (B).  As a 
result of our unblinking focus on personnel safety, our sailors and civilians 
have proven resilient to the COVID-19 global pandemic. Vaccinations, vaccine 
boosters, command engagement, and personal accountability continue to form 
the foundation of our success.  Although Commanding Officers hold ultimate 
responsibility for the health and welfare of their crews, in the case of a 
persistent pandemic every member of every command must take personal 
ownership and responsibility of the promulgated measures required to keep 
COVID-19 in check. 
 
2.  Applicability.  This guidance applies to all service members (active duty 
and ready reserve) who are members of, or support, operational units as 
defined by the applicable Navy Component Commander (NCC) per paragraph 
4.e below.  Non-operational forces, civilian employees and contractor 
personnel should follow the latest Department of Defense (DOD) Force Health 
Protection, Center for Disease Control (CDC) and state/local area 
guidance.  Additionally, host nation and/or higher-echelon Commanders 
guidance may apply. 
 
3.  Evolving Guidance.  The fight against COVID-19 has been dynamic.  Both 
the data and the response to the data continue to evolve and the CDC is the 
authority for COVID-19 measures for the general population.  The CDC 
does not provide Navy-specific guidance.  The Navy Surgeon General is the 
authority for Navy COVID-19 measures and advises the CNO on how best to apply 
CDC guidance across the spectrum of Navy operating environments. 
To date, the Navy has met or exceeded CDC guidance and continues to 
experience a much lower incidence of adverse effects than the general 
population.  Accordingly, and except as noted below in this NAVADMIN, 
evolving CDC guidance related to virus behavior should first be evaluated 
by the Navy Surgeon General prior to Fleet implementation. Questions 
regarding applicable COVID-19 measures may be directed to the point of 
contact (POC) listed above. 
 
4.  Definitions.  All CDC definitions regarding COVID-19 apply and are kept 
current on the CDC website:  https://www.cdc.gov/. 
The following additional Navy definitions are provided: 
4.a.  Immunized / Vaccinated:  Interchangeable terms for an individual who 
has completed a primary vaccine series as defined in reference (C).  Term 
applies two weeks after the final dose is received.  During the time period 
from initial dose until two weeks after the final dose, an individual is 
considered partially immunized/vaccinated. 
4.b.  Vaccine Booster:  The vaccine booster is a time-based reinforcement of 
the initial vaccine in order to prevent decreasing immunity.  A vaccine 
booster is authorized greater than 5 months after a Pfizer/BioNTech or a 
Moderna mRNA two-dose vaccine series, and greater than 2 months after a 
Johnson and Johnson single-dose vaccine. Booster guidance is subject to 
change and the most up to date information is available on the CDC website. 
4.c.  High-risk personnel:  Those individuals designated by a medical 
provider who meet CDC criteria for increased risk of severe 
illness.  Qualifying conditions are included on the CDC website. 
4.d.  Commander:  For the purposes of this NAVADMIN, the term Commander 
includes Commanding Officers, Officers-in-Charge, Masters, and Aircraft 
Commanders. 
4.e.  Operational and non-operational forces:  For the purposes of this 
NAVADMIN, operational forces and non-operational forces are defined by the 
applicable NCC.  For operational forces, this might include deployed forces, 
forces in sustainment, or other operational elements that the NCC determines 
to fall within the intent and context of this NAVADMIN. 
4.f.  Restriction of movement (ROM):  DOD term for limiting personal 
interaction to reduce risk to a broader population.  Personnel executing 
directed ROM remain in a duty status and will not be charged leave.  
ROM-sequester is the Navy term for preemptive ROM in order to reduce risk of 
infection in advance of movement. 
4.g.  Health protection measures (HPM):  Comprehensive term for mitigation 
measures that reduce the spread of COVID-19.  This includes physical 
distancing, wearing of masks, and enhanced environmental 
cleaning.  Recommended HPMs are included on the CDC website. 
4.h. Viral test:  For the purposes of this NAVADMIN, and unless specifically 
stated otherwise, a COVID test is defined as receiving a test that measures 
antigen produced by the body's immune response (antigen test) or a test that 
detects the actual presence of the virus (Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 
test). 
4.i.  Close contact:  A person who was less than 6 feet away from another, 
infected person (laboratory-confirmed or a clinical diagnosis) for a 
cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period (for example, 
three individual 5-minute exposures for a total of 15 minutes). 
 
5.  COVID-19 infected personnel and close contacts.  
5.a.  Actions for personnel suspected of being infected. 
5.a.1.  Symptomatic.  Test immediately those individuals exhibiting COVID-19 
symptoms.  If symptomatic and positive, isolate the individual per paragraph 
5.a.3. and identify close contacts per reference (D); if symptomatic and 
negative, consult a medical provider prior to returning to work. 
5.a.2.  Close contacts.  Asymptomatic close contacts should be tested 2-5 
days after exposure, if testing is available (see paragraph 6).  Close 
contacts may remain on duty but must wear a mask for 10 days. If symptoms 
develop, test per paragraph 5.a.1. 
5.a.3.  Isolation.  Isolate individuals who test positive for 5 days or until 
symptoms are clearing, whichever is longer, including 24 hours with no 
fever and without fever-reducing medication (day 0 is date of positive test 
or symptom onset, whichever occurred first).  Isolation may be conducted 
either ashore or afloat. Once released, individuals will wear a mask for an 
additional 5 days (minimum 10 days total).  No exit testing is required and, 
absent symptoms, prior positives should not be PCR tested for 90 days (per 
paragraph 6.c)., 
5.b.  Actions for unvaccinated personnel. 
5.b.1.  Per references (E), (F) and (G), all operational Navy units are 
assumed to be 100 percent vaccinated. Unvaccinated uniformed personnel should 
only include those with an approved waiver, those awaiting waiver 
disposition, or those processing for separation.  With the exception of 
separation orders, unvaccinated personnel will not execute orders until the 
COVID-19 Consolidated Disposition Authority (CCDA) has completed disposition 
of their case. 
 
6.  COVID-19 Testing. 
6.a.  Testing Priority.  Personnel exhibiting COVID like symptoms are the 
highest priority for testing. If testing asymptomatic close contacts per 
paragraph 5.a.2. stresses testing supplies, or if operations preclude testing 
(e.g., small, remote teams or depleted supplies), Commanders are authorized 
to forego testing of asymptomatic close contacts. 
6.b.  Testing of unvaccinated personnel.  Unvaccinated personnel shall follow 
the testing requirements of reference (H) and paragraph 6.c. below. 
6.c.  Testing of individuals previously infected with COVID-19.  Individuals 
previously infected with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic and continue to test 
positive by PCR for up to 90 days from date of initial diagnosis due to the 
presence of persistent non-infectious viral fragments.  Therefore, prior 
COVID positives are exempt from testing protocols for 90 days from the 
earlier of symptom onset or first positive test (90-day rule). 
Individuals exhibiting new or persistent symptoms during the 90-days 
following infection should be evaluated by a medical provider. 
6.d.  Surveillance / ship-wide testing.  Surveillance or ship-wide testing is 
neither required nor recommended and has previously generated large numbers 
of unmanageable persistent positives. 
6.e.  Test procurement.  To ensure uninterrupted operations, and as feasible, 
Commands will coordinate with their supporting supply activities to obtain 
testing supplies 60 days in advance of need. 
 
7.  Requirements for Operational units. 
7.a.  Vaccine booster.  To promote maximum protection, NCCs should continue 
the campaign for COVID-19 vaccine boosters.  Because all studies are 
converging on the need for a vaccine booster to ensure enduring protection, 
it has essentially become the next-shot in a series and will likely become 
mandatory in the near future.  There is no shortage of vaccine booster doses 
for those eligible. 
7.b.  Medical screening.  Medical screening will include newly reporting 
personnel and a command-wide monthly data review and assessment, as directed 
by the applicable NCC.  An additional pre-deployment screening will be 
completed within 7 days of deployment.  Medical screening shall be conducted 
by medical providers and reported to the unit Commander to assist in 
assessing risk and mitigations.  Screening will include, at a minimum, a 
review of vaccination and vaccine booster status, an assessment of COVID-19 
exposure history (those under the 90-day rule), and a review and assessment 
of those with underlying risk factors (high-risk determination). 
Unvaccinated Navy personnel shall not be assigned to operational units. 
7.c.  Military Sealift Command (MSC).  MSC shall medically screen Civil 
Service Mariners and contract personnel for deployment on MSC vessels in 
accordance with existing MSC Quality Management System processes and 
procedures. Unvaccinated personnel should not be assigned to operational 
units, with exceptions approved and mitigated by Commander, MSC. 
7.d.  Vaccinated High-risk personnel.  The decision to operate and deploy 
with vaccinated high-risk personnel rests with the Commander, as advised by 
medical providers, who must report intentions to their immediate superior in 
command (ISIC).  High-risk personnel shall be PCR viral tested within 3 days 
of embarking. 
7.e.  Pre-deployment ROM-sequester.  Vaccinated individuals should not 
normally be required to ROM- sequester ahead of planned operations.  In rare 
circumstances, the applicable NCC may direct a ROM-sequester in response, 
for example, to unanticipated virus behavior or in response to Geographic 
Combatant Commander (GCC) and/or host nation requirements.  Foreign clearance 
guidance is available at https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/. 
7.f.  Underway HPM.  As a result of demonstrated vaccine effectiveness, a 
100% vaccinated operational force and a healthy demographic, serious illness 
or death resulting from COVID-19 for vaccinated individuals is statistically 
very unlikely, and modeling contained in references (I), (J), and (K) 
indicates this will continue in the context of current variants.  However, 
the increasing contagious nature of evolving variants can result in 
unmanageable numbers of even mild symptomatic positives that may pose general 
health and operational unit risk, i.e. risk to force (RTF) or risk to mission 
(RTM), regardless of symptom severity. The following HPM, at a minimum, is 
required: 
7.f.1.  Medical screening as outlined above in paragraph 7.b. 
7.f.2.  Wearing masks for the first 10 days (analogous with paragraph 5 
requirements) after leaving port if more than 25% of the total crew meets the 
requirements for, but has not yet received, the vaccine booster. 
At Commanders discretion, masks may be removed if there is no evidence of 
COVID infection for 10 days (no positive symptomatic and no isolations).  At 
the onset of COVID on board, and if still greater than 25% have not received 
the vaccine booster, return to wearing masks until there is no longer 
evidence of COVID.  Although all vaccinated personnel have demonstrated 
protection against serious illness or death, this percentage indicates 
decreasing immunity and the potential for increasing numbers of symptomatic 
individuals requiring isolation. 
7.f.3.  Educate and reinforce self-monitoring for symptoms and prompt 
reporting. 
7.f.4.  Educate and reinforce frequent handwashing and social distancing, 
when applicable. 
7.f.5.  Aggressively isolate COVID-19 positive individuals per paragraph 5 
above. 
7.f.6.  Ensure adequate ventilation in spaces routinely manned. 
7.f.7.  Educate and reinforce focused cleaning efforts on high-touch 
surfaces, at least daily or more frequently, depending upon usage (e.g., 
tables, hatch latches, ladderwells, phones, watch console keyboards and 
buttons, toilets, faucets, sinks, etc.).  Although remote, there is evidence 
of surface spread of COVID-19 and other viruses with similar symptoms. 
7.g.  Considerations for adding or relaxing HPM. NCCs and Commanders should 
consider for any unit the operational impact resulting from the number 
of sailors in isolation, either ashore or afloat, regardless of percentage of 
immunized personnel, boosted personnel, or severity of symptoms.  Commanders 
may elevate HPM at any time and retain the latitude to temporarily apply 
alternate HPM in lieu of isolation to support safe operations.  An example 
might be a rapid spread that compels a Commander to utilize 
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic positives to manage watch-bill impact 
while recovering others in isolation, applying additional alternate measures 
as needed to minimize spread. The following should be considered before 
adjusting HPM: 
7.g.1.  Overall number of individuals in isolation and trend. The general 
rule of thumb for a COVID outbreak trending in a favorable direction is that 
the number of those exiting isolation matches (flattening curve) or exceeds 
(lowering curve) those entering isolation, combined with the assessment 
that the total number of symptomatic individuals is manageable and improving, 
and watch-bill (operational) impact is manageable and improving. 
7.g.2.  Proximity of a units access to shore and afloat Medical Treatment 
Facilities (MTF) within a medically relevant timeline, balanced with 
paragraph 
7.f HPM and onboard trend.  Rule of thumb is within 1-week of an MTF for 100 
percent vaccinated crew with a manageable COVID-positive case load; moving to 
a more restrictive, 72 hours or less, if a growing or concerning case load; 
or, moving to a less restrictive, beyond 1-week, if a small or no case load. 
7.h.  Port visits.  Liberty is an important mission and should be pursued 
within the context of this NAVADMIN. Geographic NCCs (GNCC) will set 
conditions for foreign port off-base liberty in coordination with country 
teams and local authorities, taking into account host country requirements, 
vaccination and booster status, sovereign immunity per paragraph 8 below, 
COVID-19 prevalence and mission requirements. 
7.i.  Aircraft operations.  On a case-by-case basis, aircrews and aircraft 
maintainers may be exempt from this guidance in order to meet emergent 
operational or NATOPS currency requirements. Exemptions and mitigation plans 
must be approved by the Squadron Commander.  For aviation units 
embarked on surface ships, mitigation plans will be coordinated with the 
ships health protection plan and approved by the ships Commanding Officer. 
7.j.  Post-deployment.  Personnel returning to homeports from deployment 
shall follow CDC and U.S. Department of State travel and testing 
requirements. If return travel includes foreign countries, personnel shall 
adhere to the requirements of those countries as well.  Updated travel 
information is on the following website: 
https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html. 
7.k.  Visitors embarking underway vessels and Navy aircraft.  All visitors 
are required to be vaccinated in accordance with reference (L), and, if 
eligible, have received a vaccine booster. Masks will be worn during transit; 
and for ships, 10 days once onboard. 
 
8.  Sovereign immunity. 
8.a.  It is U.S. Government policy to protect the sovereign immunity of 
warships, naval auxiliaries, and aircraft, including protecting crew 
information to the maximum extent possible. Within the context of COVID-19, 
host nations may request or require crew or ship information exceeding that 
authorized by U.S. policy or international law.  NCCs will ensure appropriate 
training and guidance on protecting U.S. sovereign immunity and the 
protection of health information as part of OPSEC/personal security. 
8.b.  GNCCs should determine in advance those host nations that may challenge 
our sovereign immunity and, as able, avoid them.  See reference (O) for 
additional guidance.  In all cases, GNCCs shall authorize the minimum 
information necessary in order to meet operational requirements.  The 
Navy Declaration of Health (NAVMED 6210/3) is the only authorized form for 
providing health information to foreign officials.  If required by the host 
nation, and with GNCCs concurrence, Commanders at their discretion may 
include on the NAVMED 6210/3 that their unit is 100% vaccinated, those 
disembarking will have tested negative within the required timeframe, and 
those disembarking have received a vaccine booster. 
8.c.  Exception to Policy (ETP).  On a case-by-case basis, and to support 
operations, OPNAV may grant an exception to policy (ETP) in deference to the 
varying impacts of COVID-19. Any action that may constitute or require a 
waiver of sovereign immunity must be coordinated by the applicable GNCC with 
OPNAV N3N5 for ETP approval no later than 5 days ahead of need. 
To avoid precedence beyond COVID-19, any ETP will be messaged to the host 
nation as explicitly linked to the pandemic.  Requests shall include 
justification for port selection; host nation mitigation and testing 
requirements; alternate port options; impact to mission if the request 
is denied; medical, legal, collection and privacy risk; and feedback from 
country team coordination. 
Notifications and requests may be sent via record message traffic, email to 
the POC provided above, or both. 
8.d.  Guidance for Commanders.  Per the direction of their GNCCs, Commanders 
shall comply with domestic and foreign quarantine regulations for port entry 
and document compliance on NAVMED 6210/3.  Absent GNCC approval in advance, 
Commanders will not submit to host nation COVID-19 testing nor provide 
individual or collective medical data, copies of health records, nor any 
supplementary or locally demanded health forms, and shall not grant access 
to ship or crew health records or allow the same to be searched or inspected 
by host nations.  If circumstances compel a Commander to acquiesce to 
additional host nation requirements without obtaining an ETP or GNCC 
concurrence (e.g., personnel emergency, weather avoidance), report the event 
and circumstances to OPNAV N3N5 via the chain of command as soon as 
practicable. 
 
9.  Reporting procedures.  Reporting procedures are amended as follows and 
will be incorporated in the next revision of reference (P).  OPREP-3 Navy 
Blue messages for COVID cases that do not result in death, request for 
assistance, or operational impact may instead be reported via SharePoint.  If 
unable to report via SharePoint, a single daily OPREP-3 Navy Unit SITREP 
summarizing all COVID cases onboard is required.  SharePoint information is 
used to produce daily reports to Senior Navy and DoD Leadership.
