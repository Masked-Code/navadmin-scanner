SUBJ/ANNUAL RECERTIFICATION OF SPECIAL DUTY ASSIGNMENT PAY//

REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/5OCT17//
REF/B/DOC/DOD/11JAN19//

NARR/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1160.6C, SPECIAL DUTY ASSIGNMENT PAY PROGRAM.  
REF B IS DOD INSTRUCTION 1340.26 CHANGE 1, ASSIGNMENT AND SPECIAL DUTY 
ASSIGNMENT PAY.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the annual special duty assignment pay 
(SDAP) recertification process for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020.  In line with 
references (a) and (b), commanding officers (CO) are required to annually 
review and certify the entitlement to SDAP of each Sailor.  This 
recertification is to verify that every Sailor who is assigned to an eligible 
billet is still qualified to fill that billet and is receiving the correct 
level of SDAP.

2.  SDAP recertification will not be forwarded to the personnel support 
detachment (PSD)/Transaction Support Center (TSC)/pay office for the command.  
However, any action to start, stop or change the level of a Sailors SDAP must 
be submitted to PSD/TSC/pay office via the Transaction Online Processing 
System.  Recertification shall commence upon the date of this NAVADMIN and 
continue through 31 August 2020.  Failure by commands to complete the 
required recertification by 31 August 2020 will result in stopping the SDAP 
of their Sailors until the annual recertification is endorsed by their 
immediate superior in command (ISIC) and submitted to the Community 
Management Support Branch (BUPERS-328).  This endorsement cannot be signed by 
direction nor by an acting ISIC.  A list of the commands that do not 
recertify on time will be sent to the Chief of Naval Personnel (CNP) and the 
N1 staffs at U.S. Fleet Forces (USFF) and U.S. Pacific Fleet (PACFLT) by 
Military Pay and Compensation Policy Branch (OPNAV N130).  Once the 
recertification is submitted, back pay will then be approved.

3.  To verify if a Sailor is eligible and receiving the correct level of 
SDAP, a complete list of authorized skills and pay amounts can be found by 
visiting https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/pay-and-benefits, then clicking on 
the *SRB* tab and navigating to the SDAP section on that page.

4.  Follow these procedures to certify the SDAP report of your command:
    a.  Obtain and print the annual SDAP report of your command.
The annual SDAP report only pulls those Sailors that are currently drawing 
SDAP.
        (1) The command annual SDAP report may be obtained by sending a 
digitally signed e-mail to the SDAP Recertification Report help desk at 
mill_sdap_recert.fct(at)navy.mil.
        (2) Annual SDAP report requesters are to include their primary unit 
identification code (UIC) in the subject line and any required subordinate 
UICs in the e-mail body.
        (3) Reports will only be provided to Command Career Management 
System-Interactive Detailing (CMS-ID) users with the Activity Manning Manager 
(AMM) role.  Requester must have CMS-ID AMM access for all subordinate UICs 
requested.  Commands with no AMM will need to submit a CMS-ID AMM access 
request which can be found by visiting 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/mnpmain, then clicking on *Quick Links*, then 
clicking on the *NPC* tab.  Under the tab labeled *enlisted* click *CMS-ID*.
        (4) The SDAP report will be returned as an attachment in an encrypted 
e-mail. If you are having trouble sending or receiving encrypted e-mail, 
ensure that your encryption email certificate is posted to the global address 
list.  If you are still having encryption issues, contact BUPERS-328 via 
e-mail at mill_sdap_recert.fct(at)navy.mil or by phone at (901)-874-3260.
    b.  Verify your command as a whole and make changes as follows:
        (1) Add all Sailors who are eligible for SDAP, but not listed in the 
annual SDAP report.  To add, simply handwrite or type the name, rate, 
effective date and level on the bottom of the annual SDAP report.  If there 
is not enough space, attach a list on command letterhead.
        (2) Draw a line through any Sailor who is no longer eligible and put 
a brief description as to why they are no longer eligible 
(transfer/separation/loss of Navy enlisted classifications).
        (3) Verify levels are in line with the most recent SDAP eligibility 
chart by visiting https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/pay-
and-benefits, then clicking on the *SRB* tab and navigating to the SDAP 
section on that page.
        (4) The original signature of the CO must be on each page of the 
annual SDAP report accompanied by the following statement:
*After review, I certify that all required additions and changes have been 
annotated, actions required to start, stop, increase or decrease have been 
processed via PSD/TSC/pay office prior to submission of recertification and 
all Sailors at this command are receiving the correct SDAP entitlement.*  
This statement can be handwritten, typed or put on with a label.  A cover 
letter is not required and only recommended if the command needs more space 
for Sailors added.
        (5) Provide a point of contact in the top right-hand corner of the 
first page of the annual SDAP report.
        (6) Send the SDAP report via encrypted e-mail to 
mill_sdap_recert.fct(at)navy.mil.  The e-mail subject line must contain UIC, 
POC:  rate, name, phone number and e-mail.
        (7) E-mail is the preferred method, but if you need to send the 
report via regular mail, please send to:

    Navy Personnel Command
    ATTN:  Community Management Support Branch (BUPERS-328)
    5720 Integrity Drive
    Millington, TN 38055-0130

5.  Each command is responsible for ensuring updates are made to Sailor 
records through the commands servicing PSD/TSC/pay office.
No changes will be made by Navy Personnel Command (NAVPERSCOM) as part of the 
annual recertification process.

6.  Commands can check the status of their SDAP recertification at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/pay-and-benefits, then clicking on the *SRB* 
tab and navigating to the SDAP section on that page.
Commands are strongly encouraged to use this site to ensure all subordinate 
commands have completed the recertification.  Please allow 5 to 10 days after 
submission for the webpage to be updated.

7.  Point of contact is BUPERS-328, (901)874-3260/DSN 882 / 
mill_sdap_recert.fct(at)navy.mil.

8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or 1 October 2020, 
whichever occurs first.
