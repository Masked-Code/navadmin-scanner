RMKS/1.  The purpose of this NAVADMIN is to announce the call for nominations 
for the annual Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy
(MCPON) Delbert D. Black Leadership Award.

2.  During his 30 years of distinguished service to the Navy, MCPON Delbert 
D. Black was an exceptional deckplate leader committed to Sailor and family 
advocacy.  He possessed the highest levels of moral, ethical and professional 
behavior, and unquestionable integrity.  His unselfish ability to lead Chief 
Petty Officers (CPO), unwavering loyalty to the Navy, and commitment to 
developing junior officers and Sailors set a positive tone for the Navy.

3.  This award is presented to recognize the first-tour Command Master Chief 
(CMDCM), Chief of the Boat (COB), or Command Senior Chief (CMDCS) who best 
leads the alignment efforts of the Chief of Naval Operations' Strategic

Navy Core Values and CPO expectations, demonstrates those same ideals of 
service with sacrifice as demonstrated by MCPON Black, and upholds the 
highest standards of professionalism and integrity.

4.  The reporting period for the award is 1 January 2017 -
31 December 2017, and all eligible Command Senior Enlisted Leaders must have 
been at their commands for the entire reporting period.
The criteria for this award and all nominee packages shall be submitted in 
accordance with paragraph 4 of reference (a).
Nomination boards shall be conducted at the Fleet Master Chief level in their 
area of responsibility, through their applicable Force or Immediate Superior 
in Command Master Chiefs.  One CMDCM, COB, or CMDCS nominee from each Fleet 
Master Chief and direct-report CMDCM shall be forwarded to the Command Senior 
Enlisted Leader Management Office no later than Friday,
6 April 2018.

5.  The award recipient will be announced at the Spring MCPON Leadership Mess
