2.  Application Procedures and Timeline. 
    a.  Candidates for the PMM and ASM programs must apply to both the Navy 
and to the university. Acceptance into the PMM or ASM program by the Navy 
does not equal acceptance by the school. Applications to the Navy require a 
personal statement to the board, a curriculum vitae, biography, and 
endorsements from both the commanding officer and the detailer. Submission of 
official undergraduate/graduate transcripts (as appropriate) and GRE/GMAT 
scores to the Navy selection board is highly encouraged, but not required.  A 
sample PMM/ASM application package is found at reference (a), enclosure (1). 
    b.  Applications to the school vary according to each school's specific 
requirements.  When completing the university application, prospective 
students should state that they are a Navy-funded PMM or ASM post-master's 
candidate. Candidates must verify that they meet each university's work 
experience requirements and are advised to apply to at least three schools. 
    c. Officers may apply for SDSTP only, but those applying for PMM who meet 
eligibility criteria in reference (c) are encouraged to also apply for 
SDSTP.  If selected for PMM, these officers will be contacted and offered the 
opportunity to complete the separate SDSTP application process through OSD. 
Should the PMM-selected officer subsequently not be selected for SDSTP, the 
officer will retain a guaranteed seat in the PMM program. 
    d.  Applications are due to Navy Personnel Command NLT 11 September 
2020.  All supplemental information to the board, to include GRE scores and 
letters of recommendation, must be received NLT 29 October 2020.  The 
selection board will convene in December 2020 and results will be announced 
in December 2020.
