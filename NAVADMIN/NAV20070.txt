RMKS/1.  This message announces and solicits research topics for the Naval 
Research Working Group (NRWG) 20, to be conducted 21 to 23 April 2020 by the 
Naval Postgraduate School (NPS).  Note: Due to coronavirus mitigation 
measures, NRWG 20 will be conducted in an entirely virtual event format.
Virtual NRWG event planning is underway; updated details will follow at 
https://nps.edu/web/naval-research-program.

2.  Background: NPS's Naval Research Program (NRP) consists of research 
projects that address current and future naval warfighting challenges. The 
primary mechanism for obtaining NRP support is through participation at the 
annual NRWG meeting, which brings together Fleet topic sponsors, NPS faculty 
members, and students to discuss potential research topics and initiatives.
Research conducted through NRP will provide operationally-relevant research 
experience for NPS faculty; operationally-relevant thesis opportunities for 
NPS students; and actionable findings for the topic sponsors.

3.  NRWG 20 will develop a research agenda aligned to CNO strategic guidance 
including FRAGO 01/2019 (A Design for Maintaining Maritime Superiority) and 
CNO-identified Key Operational Problems (KOPs).  For information and 
background on the KOPs, sponsors shall contact the OPNAV Strategic 
Warfighting Innovation Cell (N73).  N73 POCs:
- CAPT Nicholas Dienna, nicholas.j.dienna@navy.(smil.)mil, (703) 695-6583
- CAPT Dave Soldow, david.soldow@navy.mil, david.s.soldow1@navy.smil.mil,
(703) 695-6764
- CDR Ben Van Buskirk, benjamin.d.vanbuskir@navy.(smil.)mil, (703) 605-6630
- LT Evan Greer, evan.greer@navy.mil, evan.r.greer2@navy.smil.mil,
(703) 695-6746

4.  NRWG 20 participants will include representatives from Navy and Marine 
Corps agencies who have research or analysis requirements, NPS students, and 
NPS faculty and staff.

5.  Topic sponsors should enter research topics in the topic portal on the 
NRP website (my.nps.edu/nrp/topic-portal) no later than 10 April 2020.  A CAC 
card is required to log in.  As noted above, topics should closely align to 
CNO guidance and KOPs.  For classified studies, enter an unclassified title 
in the portal and provide detailed contact information (Name, Phone, NIPR 
email address, and SIPR, JWICS, and/or NSANet email addresses).  NPS faculty 
will contact your POC to coordinate receipt of classified details.

6.  The NRWG will include development of Initial Research Estimate Forms 
(IREFs).  Topic sponsors and NPS Faculty should begin jointly scoping IREFs 
prior to NRWG.  Approved IREFs are forwarded to the Navy Topic Review Board
(TRB) for validation and prioritization. The TRB will be coordinated via 
separate correspondence.

7.  Virtual working group sessions will begin on 21 April 2020.  Detailed 
schedule information and other important administrative details will be 
posted on the Naval Research Program website, https://my.nps.edu/nrp/nrwg-20.

Warfighting Development.//
