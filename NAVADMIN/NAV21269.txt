RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits motivated officer (O-3 through O-5) and 
enlisted (E-4 through E-8) applicants for duty with the U.S. Navy Ceremonial 
Guard.  Interested volunteers who meet the below criteria, and as required by 
references (a) through (c), are eligible to apply for billets as early as 15 
months from their projected rotation date. 
 
2.  Established in 1931, the U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard is the official 
ceremonial unit of the Navy.  Located in Washington, D.C., the primary 
mission of the Ceremonial Guard is to represent the service in presidential, 
Joint Armed Forces, Navy and public ceremonies in the National Capital Region 
and around the world. Members of the Navy Ceremonial Guard participate in 
some of the most prestigious ceremonies including presidential inaugurations, 
State Funerals and arrival ceremonies for foreign officials in our nation. 
In addition, the Navy Ceremonial Guard conducts all funeral honors for Navy 
personnel and dependents buried in Arlington National Cemetery.  Elements of 
the command, such as the U.S. Navy Drill Team and Color Guard, regularly 
represent the Navy in public events across the country. 
 
3.  Volunteers must be strong leaders who are ready to serve as role models 
to large numbers of junior Sailors.  Volunteers must always operate with 
maturity and tact and be an exceptional and disciplined representative of the 
U.S. Navy, both on and off-duty.  They must have impeccable appearance, 
excellent military bearing and meet the following height requirements (waived 
on a case by case basis for exceptional candidates): 
    a.  Male:  minimum 6 feet. 
    b.  Female:  minimum 5 feet 10 inches. 
 
4.  Volunteers must meet the minimum qualifications contained in reference 
(a) and the following additional requirements: 
    a.  No driving under the influence/driving while intoxicated convictions 
within last five years. 
    b.  No excessive debt.  The command financial specialist should evaluate 
the debt-to-income ratio of the member.

a completed Enlisted Personnel Action Request (NAVPERS 1306/7) to their 
rating detailer via their commanding officer, requesting release to shore 
special programs for assignment to the U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard.  Once 
released, the shore special programs detailer will release a screening 
message to the command with application requirements.  Once the application 
package is received and reviewed, a telephone interview will be arranged with 
the U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard Command Master Chief.  Because of the 
challenging nature of duty onboard the U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard, enlisted 
Sailors whose records reflect that they have succeeded in this assignment may 
be viewed positively on future enlisted advancement boards.
