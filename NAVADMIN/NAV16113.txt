RMKS/1.  Before announcing Navy nominees for the 2016 SECDEF Maintenance 
Awards, I want to personally thank the numerous commands who took the time to 
recognize their unit contributions. Your continued participation ensures that 
the best maintenance units are recognized for the remarkable efforts and 
support they provide to our warfighters.  It was an honor to review such a 
large and competitive field of deserving units, and a pleasure to announce 
Navy's nominees to SECDEF.

2.  Annually, six field-level maintenance units will be awarded the SECDEF 
Field-Level Maintenance Awards, two from each competitive category (small, 
medium and large).  From these six winning units, one will be selected as the 
*best of the best* and named the annual SECDEF Phoenix Award winner.  Navy 
nominees for the field-level competition are:
A.  Small Commands:
HELICOPTER SEA COMBAT SQUADRON TWELVE (HSC 12)
FLEET READINESS CENTER MIDDLE ATLANTIC DETACHMENT-PATUXENT RIVER
B.  Medium Commands:
ASSAULT CRAFT UNIT FOUR (ACU 4)
USS NORMANDY (CG 60)
C.  Large Commands:
USS RONALD REAGAN (CVN 76)
TRIDENT REFIT FACILITY, KINGS BAY, GEORGIA

3.  Annually, one program from an organic depot-level maintenance activity 
will be awarded the SECDEF Robert T. Mason Award for Depot Maintenance 
Excellence.  Navy nominees for the depot-level competition are:
A.  FLEET READINESS CENTER-SOUTHEAST (P-3 INTEGRATED PRODUCT SUPPORT TEAM)
B.  PORTSMOUTH NAVAL SHIPYARD (USS ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERED OVERHAUL PROJECT 
TEAM)

4.  SECDEF selection boards will evaluate similar input from all Services and 
announce six field-level winners (two per category), and one depot-level 
winner.  All SECDEF maintenance award recipients will be recognized by the 
Office of the Secretary of Defense at a formal awards ceremony to be 
announced under separate correspondence.

5.  The outstanding initiative, imagination, and professionalism demonstrated 
by all participants are an excellent reflection of our Navy-wide core 
attributes; Integrity, Accountability, Initiative, and Toughness.  
Congratulations to all nominees.
