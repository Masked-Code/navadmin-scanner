RMKS/1. Request all personnel currently on Active Duty participate in the 
Navy's annual Health of the Force (HoF) survey. This voluntary and 
confidential survey will remain open through 31 August 2023, takes less than 
20 minutes to complete, and can be accessed on military or personal computers 
and on mobile devices at: 
usnavy.gov1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3mk65UxsLQgMMjI. 
Command triads are encouraged to lead the way by taking the survey themselves 
and emphasize its value within their commands. 
 
2. In 2023, the HoF survey was accelerated due to the new timing for command 
climate assessments contained in references (a) and (b). 
In 2024, the HoF survey will launch in March. 
 
3. The HoF Survey is used for three reasons: 
a. Enables a comprehensive view of the Navy that is used to develop Navy's 
HoF report. The 2022 HoF report is reference (c) and available at: 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Portals/55/Reference/Publications/CY20 
22_HOF_FINAL_8_Feb_23.pdf?ver=NfT0FRHSJlgEtWk0mE22lQ%3D%3D. 
b. With sufficient participation, allows the Navy to measure key metrics for 
each of Navy's 17 communities. This data is used for Navy Leader Development 
Framework (NLDF) briefs from community leads to the Chief and/or Vice Chief 
of Naval Operations. NLDFs now occur within 90 days of the assumption of 
command, and every 12-to- 18 months thereafter. 
c. Provides the Navy with an opportunity to evaluate the programs and 
policies that impact Sailors' personal and professional lives.
 
4. In logging into the survey, participants will be asked for their 
Department of Defense Identification (DOD ID) number. DoD ID numbers will not 
be used to link answers to a particular respondent and confidentiality will 
be maintained. 
 
5. Questions about the survey can be sent to the Navy Survey Office (OPNAV 
N176), Dr. Jen Jebo at Jennifer.l.jebo.civ@us.navy.mil.
