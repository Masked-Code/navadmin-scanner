RMKS/1.  The Navy League of the United States (NLUS) will hold its annual 
Sea-Air-Space (SAS) exposition from 2 to 4 August, 2021 with a co-located 
STEM expo on 1 August, 2021 at the Gaylord National Resort and Conference 
Center, located in National Harbor, MD.  SAS provides a platform for the 
professional development of Department of the Navy personnel on the latest 
developments in naval warfare, as well as an opportunity for Navy engagement 
with representatives from a broad cross-section of government, industry, 
academia, and the international community.

2.  This year SAS will be focusing on integrated American naval power and is 
appropriate in this age of growing maritime competition.  The SAS schedule is 
designed with a focus on readiness and innovation, with panels covering 
topics such as artificial intelligence, cyber, strategic sealift, leadership, 
shipbuilding, aviation and manpower.
SAS will showcase leaders from across the United States Navy, Marine Corps, 
Coast Guard, other governmental agencies and industry. Many international 
delegations will be in attendance, including several Heads of Navy.  A full 
list of speakers and more information on international representation can be 
found at www.seaairspace.org.

3.  Per reference (a), attendance at non-DoD hosted conferences which have 
historically exceeded $250,000 may require SECNAV/UNSECNAV approval.  SAS 
2021 meets this threshold.  Therefore, requests for attendance shall be 
consolidated by Echelon-2 commands and provided to OPNAV N97 with the number 
of attendees and cost estimates to N97
POC: LCDR Ryan Blankenship at ryan.blankenship(at)navy.mil,
(703)571-8444 to track overall costs and attendance data.  Final conference 
requests are to be submitted no later than 15 July, 2021.
Overall approval of DON-wide attendance is expected in mid-June.  If no cost 
is incurred by the government (i.e. people local to area), no submission or 
approval is required.  The following restrictions
apply:
    a. Subject to command discretion, attendance is authorized for local 
participants at no cost to the government.
    b. SAS 2021 is primarily an East Coast event.  Funded TAD travel from 
West Coast/International commands should be examined unless member has an 
active role in the event (sitting on a panel, making an official U.S. Navy 
presentation, etc.).  Excessive attendance will be subject to cuts based on 
overall cost.
    c. NLUS has offered free attendance at the below eight events to all 
military and civilian government service personnel.  Because there is a 
maximum number of seats available, attendees are required to pre-register and 
will be ticketed by space available.  Per reference (b), this free attendance 
does not constitute a gift for purposes of applicable ethics regulations, and 
therefore may be accepted by all military and civilian personnel.

ethics counselor for assistance in determining whether attendance is 
permissible.
    e. All Navy participation in SAS 2021 shall be consistent with the Joint 
Ethics Regulations found at reference (c).
