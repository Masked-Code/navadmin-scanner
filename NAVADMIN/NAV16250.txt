SUBJ/NAVAL POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL DISTANCE LEARNING GRADUATE EDUCATION PROGRAMS 
AVAILABLE FOR ACADEMIC YEAR 2017//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) defense-
focused masters degrees and graduate certificates to develop quantitative 
skills and competencies, producing graduates with the disciplined analytical 
approach to problem solving that is essential to an effective and dynamic 
defense enterprise.  NPS is dedicated to providing relevant, high-quality 
education to empower the next generation of leadership in the Department of 
Defense (DoD).  A variety of delivery methods are utilized to expand learning 
beyond the traditional classroom.

2.  NPS distance learning (DL) programs are part-time programs (usually 12 to 
24 months) for mid-grade military officers and DoD civilian leaders who are 
unable to attend NPS residential graduate programs.  Graduate certificates 
are also available to qualified enlisted personnel.  U.S. Navy Reserve 
officers should contact Commander, Naval Reserve Forces Command (N7) in 
regards to program eligibility.  DoD contractor personnel applications will 
be considered for admission on a space-available basis. Student application 
forms are available at: 
http://www.nps.edu/Academics/Admissions/ApplyOnline/ApplyNow.html

3.  Enrollment requirements. In addition to the application process, students 
that do not fall under the mission-funded category must be sponsored by their 
command or employer.  All NPS students must have a signed Participation 
Agreement for NPS DL Programs.
a.  All Active Duty Navy and Marine Corps officers who are academically 
eligible are mission-funded, therefore, there is no cost to the officer.  
U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) officers will apply through the USMC DL program as 
advertised in the corresponding annual MARADMIN message.
b.  All other prospective DL students must have a Memorandum of Agreement 
(MOA) and a funding document in place in order to be enrolled in any NPS DL 
program.
(1) For Navy and Marine Corps reserve officers, enlisted personnel, and 
Department of the Navy (DON) civilians, the MOA is a fillable interagency 
agreement, DON 7600A form, and the funding document is order for work and 
services, NAVCOMPT 2275, or order for work and services direct citation, 
NAVCOMPT 2276A.
(2) For non-Navy DoD agencies, the MOA is Financial Management 
Standardization (FMS) form 7600A and the funding document is DD Form 448, 
military interdepartmental purchase request.
(3) For non-DoD Federal agencies, the FMS 7600A form and the funding document 
is FMS 7600B.  The FMS 7600A/B serves as the standard form to be used 
Government-wide for all reimbursable agreements at the trading partner level, 
including, but not limited to: agreements between agencies, agreements within 
agencies, grant-related agreements, and assisted acquisitions.
