SUBJ/GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM SUPPORT ASSIGNMENTS (GSA)// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES OUR INTENT TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN 
SHIFTING THE WAY THE NAVY ASSIGNS SAILORS TO MISSIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE 
GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM (GWOT).  OVER THE COMING MONTHS, WE WILL 
EXECUTE A PLAN WHICH TRANSITIONS OUR GWOT ASSIGNMENT PRACTICES FROM A 
NORM TODAY OF SHORT NOTICE, MID-TOUR, TEMPORARY DUTY, INDIVIDUAL 
AUGMENTEE (IA) ASSIGNMENTS, TO A NORM OF PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION
(PCS) GWOT SUPPORT ASSIGNMENTS (GSA) NEGOTIATED IN THE SAILOR'S NORMAL 
DETAILING WINDOW. 
2.  THE PURPOSE OF THE SHIFT IS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE PREDICTABILITY 
OF GWOT ASSIGNMENTS FOR OUR SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES, ENABLE 
VOLUNTEERISM, IMPROVE MANNING STABILITY AT THE UNIT LEVEL, AND ADD 
DETAILER INVOLVEMENT FOR OVERSIGHT OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND 
CAREER PROGRESSION.  OUR EXISTING IA PROCESS MEETS MISSION AND HAS 
MATURED TO THE POINT THAT WE AVERAGE NEARLY 60 DAYS NOTIFICATION.  
HOWEVER, IT ALSO LIMITS SAILOR INPUT INTO THE PROCESS, MASKS UNIT LEVEL 
MANNING IMPACTS, AND ITS UNPREDICTABILITY BREEDS UNCERTAINTY AND 
CONCERN FROM THE FLEET.
3.  WE WILL IMPLEMENT THIS SHIFT BY BRINGING KNOWN GWOT ASSIGNMENTS 
INTO OUR NAVY ASSIGNMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS SO THAT WE CAN ADVERTISE, 
DISPLAY, AND IN EVERYWAY MAINSTREAM GSA'S INTO OUR DETAILING PROCESSES.  
SIMILARLY, WE WILL MANAGE OUR MANPOWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS AND NAVY 
MANNING PLAN (NMP) TO ACCOUNT FOR GWOT REQUIREMENTS. 
WE CANNOT DO THIS OVERNIGHT.  PHASE I OF THE PROCESS WILL START IN JUNE 
2007 FOR OFFICERS, AND AUGUST 2007 FOR OUR ENLISTED SAILORS, AND WILL 
CONTINUE THROUGH 2008.  IN PHASE I, NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND WILL BEGIN 
MAINSTREAM DETAILING OF APPROXIMATELY 1,200 JOINT MANNING DOCUMENT (JMD) 
DRIVEN, GWOT SUPPORT BILLETS AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE FOR REFILL 
BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2007 AND DECEMBER 2008.  THIS ACCOUNTS FOR ONE-THIRD 
OF ALL ACTIVE COMPONENT (AC) REQUIREMENTS WHICH EXIST TODAY.  AS WE 
ACHIEVE SUCCESS WITH PHASE I, WE WILL CONTINUE DETAILED LEVEL PLANNING 
TO INITIATE PHASE II OF THE PROCESS WHICH WILL ACCOUNT FOR REQUEST FOR 
FORCES (RFF) REFILL REQUIREMENTS, BRINGING A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 80 
PERCENT OF THE AC GWOT SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS INTO THE MAINSTREAM 
DETAILING PROCESS.  PHASE III IS AIMED AT MAINSTREAMING EMERGENT FILLS 
INTO THE PROCESS, WHICH CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT 
OF ALL ACTIVE COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS.  
4.  THE DESIRED END STATE IS A SAILOR ASSIGNMENT AND DISTRIBUTION 
SYSTEM WHICH RETAINS PREDICTABILITY FOR OUR SAILORS AND STABILITY FOR 
OUR COMMANDS, YET IS AGILE ENOUGH TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE 
COMBATANT COMMANDERS IN THE GWOT.  IN THE NEAR TERM, OUR PLAN IS TO 
RAPIDLY EVOLVE OUR SUPPORT OF THE GWOT TO AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE GSA 
ASSIGNMENTS ARE THE NORM, AND MID-TOUR IA ASSIGNMENTS ARE THE EXCEPTION.  
OUR PHASED APPROACH WILL GET US THERE WITH YOUR SUPPORT.
5.  I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AS WE TRANSITION THERE WILL BE TWO PROCESSES IN 
PLACE SIMULTANEOUSLY.  THIS WILL HAVE SEVERAL SHORT LIVED SECOND ORDER 
EFFECTS FOR WHICH I ASK YOUR SUPPORT IN SPREADING THE WORD AND STAYING 
THE COURSE.  FIRST, SINCE THE EXISTING IA PROCESS WILL CONTINUE 
SOURCING THE MAJORITY OF IAS IN THE NEAR TERM, THERE WILL BE NO 
IMMEDIATE, DRAMATIC DROP IN "MID-TOUR IA VULNERABILITY", AND WE SHOULD 
EXPECT FOR THE NEXT 6-7 MONTHS THAT THE MAJORITY OF GWOT REQUIREMENTS 
WILL BE SOURCED THROUGH THE EXISTING IA PROCESS.  THIS SHOULD NOT BE 
SEEN AS FAILURE.  I ASK THAT YOU EMPHASIZE THE NEW GSA OPPORTUNITIES 
OFFERED TO OUR SAILORS AS THEY REACH THEIR DETAILING WINDOW AND THAT 
FOR EVERY NAVY GSA GENERATED, THERE IS A CORRESPONDING NAVY-WIDE 
DECREASE IN MID-TOUR IA REQUIREMENTS.  THIS MAY NOT BE PLAINLY VISIBLE 
TO THE SAILOR AT FIRST GLANCE.  SECOND, AS WE MAINSTREAM GSA 
REQUIREMENTS, THERE WILL BE CORRESPONDING OFFSETS IN NMP AND OFFICER 
MANNING ACROSS THE FLEET.  SINCE THE EXISTING PROCESS WILL CONTINUE, 
COMMANDS WILL BE ASKED TO PROVIDE PERSONNEL FOR IAS AND MAY 
SIMULTANEOUSLY SEE AN UNRELATED DECREASE IN NMP TO ACCOUNT FOR THE GSA 
REQUIREMENTS.  WE MUST EMPHASIZE THAT AS WE TRANSITION THERE WILL BE 
LESS AND LESS REQUIREMENT FOR COMMANDS TO RIP SAILORS MID-TOUR.  SINCE 
WE ARE NOT CHANGING THE OVERALL REQUIREMENT, COMMANDS WILL FEEL THE 
COST OF GWOT SUPPORT THROUGH REDUCTIONS IN NMP AND GAPPED OFFICER 
BILLETS.  OUR MANPOWER MANAGEMENT PROCESS WILL BE ADDRESSED IN A 
SEPARATE NAVADMIN. 
6.  HIGH DEMAND/LOW DENSITY (HD/LD) COMMUNITIES.  THERE HAS BEEN MUCH 
WORK DONE TO ACCOUNT FOR AND MANAGE OUR HD/LD COMMUNITIES IN OUR 
SUPPORT OF THE GWOT.  I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOR THE SAILORS IN THOSE 
COMMUNITIES, THE GWOT DEMAND SIGNAL MAY OUTSTRIP THE CAPACITY OF 
SAILORS WITH THE APPROPRIATE SKILL SETS IN THEIR DETAILING WINDOW. 
FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES, I EXPECT THAT THEY WILL TRANSITION TO THE NEW 
PROCESS ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE NAVY, AND WHEN COMPLIANCE IS NOT 
POSSIBLE DUE TO DEMAND SIGNAL, THAT THE WORK DONE AND RELATIONSHIPS 
BUILT BETWEEN COMMUNITY MANAGERS AND BUDGET SUBMITTING OFFICES (BSO S), 
WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PREDICTABILITY TO OUR SAILORS AND THEIR 
FAMILIES, AND STABILITY TO PARENT COMMANDS CONSISTENT WITH THE DESIRED 
END STATE.
7.  AS WITH THE EXISTING PROCESS, I KNOW THAT SAILORS, COMMANDS, AND 
BSO S WILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NEW PROCESS.  MY TEAM, ALONG WITH 
KEY STAKEHOLDERS FROM FLEET FORCES COMMAND, NECC, OPNAV N3/5, CNIC, AND 
OTHERS ARE WORKING TO UPDATE OUR IA PUBLICATIONS AND WEBSITES TO ANSWER 
AS MANY QUESTIONS AS WE CAN.  ADDITIONALLY, ALL NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND 
DETAILERS WILL RECEIVE TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE INFORMED AND 
CAN PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION TO THE FLEET.  FUTURE TASK FORCE IA 
(TFIA) NAVADMINS WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE GSA PROCESS.
8.  IN SUMMARY, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GSA PROCESS IS SWEEPING 
CHANGE RAPIDLY EXECUTED.  THERE WILL BE A LEARNING CURVE TO BE SURE, 
BUT I BELIEVE CHANGE IS NECESSARY NOW.  BRINGING OUR SUPPORT OF THE 
GWOT INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF OUR DETAILING PROCESSES IS THE RIGHT THING 
TO DO FOR OUR SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES.
