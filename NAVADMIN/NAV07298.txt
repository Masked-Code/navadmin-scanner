RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES CLARIFYING GUIDANCE TO REGULAR 
REPORTING SENIORS, CONCURRENT REPORTING SENIORS, AND MEMBERS REGARDING 
THE PROPER PREPARATION OF PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS FOR NAVY PERSONNEL 
ASSIGNED TO MISSIONS SUPPORTING THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM (GWOT).  
THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THESE TEMPORARY ADDITIONAL DUTY IA ASSIGNMENTS AND 
PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION GSA?S REQUIRE DUE DILIGENCE BY ALL 
CONCERNED TO FAIRLY EVALUATE SAILORS AND ENSURE THEY ARE NOT 
INADVERTENTLY DISADVANTAGED WHILE SERVING ON IA OR GSA ASSIGNMENTS.  
THIS NAVADMIN DOES NOT CHANGE REF A, BUT SERVES AS A SYNOPSIS OF 
GUIDANCE FOUND THROUGHOUT REF A.
2.  RESPONSIBILITIES
    A.  REGULAR REPORTING SENIORS MUST MAINTAIN REGULAR PERFORMANCE 
EVALUATION CONTINUITY BY SUBMITTING EITHER AN OBSERVED OR NOT OBSERVED 
REGULAR REPORT, AS APPLICABLE, OR ENDORSING A CONCURRENT
REPORT AS A CONCURRENT/REGULAR REPORT.   (NOTE:  A CONCURRENT REPORT
MAY ONLY BE ENDORSED AS CONCURRENT/REGULAR WHEN THERE IS NO GAP BETWEEN 
THE BEGINNING DATE OF THE CONCURRENT REPORT AND THE ENDING DATE OF THE 
PREVIOUS REGULAR REPORT.)
    B.  REPORTING SENIORS WHERE THE IA IS PERFORMED MUST:
        (1) EVALUATE AND DOCUMENT SAILOR PERFORMANCE DURING IA OR GSA 
ASSIGNMENTS OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS BY:
            (A) SUBMITTING CONCURRENT REPORTS FOR ACTIVE COMPONENT
(AC) SAILORS.
            (B) SUBMITTING REGULAR REPORTS FOR MOBILIZED RESERVISTS.
        (2) FORWARD ADVANCE COPIES OF ENTIRE SUMMARY GROUPS DIRECTLY TO 
PERS-311 IN CONJUNCTION WITH MAILING INDIVIDUAL REPORTS TO REGULAR 
REPORTING SENIORS FOR COUNTERSIGNATURE.
    C.  SAILORS MUST:
        (1) COORDINATE WITH THEIR PARENT COMMAND AND SUPPORTED COMMAND 
TO ENSURE REQUIRED REPORTS ARE COMPLETED.
        (2) PROVIDE EVALUATION INPUT TO BOTH REGULAR AND CONCURRENT 
REPORTING SENIORS.
        (3) REVIEW THEIR OFFICIAL MILITARY PERSONNEL FILE (OMPF) PRIOR 
TO PROMOTION AND CAREER MILESTONE BOARDS TO VERIFY THAT THEIR IA/GSA 
ASSIGNMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE RECORD.  SAILORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO 
EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO SUBMIT CORRESPONDENCE DIRECTLY TO SELECTION 
BOARDS DISCUSSING MATTERS THEY DEEM IMPORTANT.  SEE THE NPC WEBSITE AND 
PARA 14 OF REF B FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
3.  ALL CONCERNED MUST WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER TO ENSURE THE PERFORMANCE 
OF SAILORS SERVING IN SUPPORT OF GWOT IS FAIRLY EVALUATED AND 
ACCURATELY DOCUMENTED.  THROUGH THE ASTUTE USE OF TOOLS CURRENTLY 
AVAILABLE, REPORTING SENIORS CAN ELIMINATE UNINTENDED NEGATIVE CAREER 
IMPACTS RESULTING FROM POORLY DOCUMENTED PERFORMANCE WHILE SERVING ON 
IA OR GSA ASSIGNMENTS.
