RMKS/1.  Reference (a) requires Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to 
ensure that the information needs relating to civilian law enforcement 
activities in proximity to the international borders of the United States are 
identified and communicated to the Secretary of Defense for the purposes of 
the planning and executing of military training by the Department of Defense 
(DoD). Reference (b) directs the military departments to take into account 
the needs of civilian law enforcement officials for information, to the 
maximum extent practicable, in the planning and execution of military 
training or operations in accordance with reference (c).

2.  DHS created an LMT portal within the homeland security information 
network (HSIN) to facilitate the dissemination of law enforcement information 
needs to the Armed Forces and to ensure that the information relevant to law 
enforcement that is collected by the Armed Forces during the normal course of 
military training is provided to relevant officials.  It is expected that the 
LMT portal will be web accessible and common access card (CAC) enabled.
DHS is expected to begin to build LMT accounts for the services by July 31, 
2017.

3.  Commander, Fleet Forces Command (FFC) and Commander, Pacific Fleet 
(PACFLT) will determine how to implement and manage LMT for their assigned 
forces, to include access management for the LMT portal, in accordance with 
references (a) through (j) and the following guidelines:
    a.  LMT will be supported, to the maximum extent practicable, during the 
normal course of military training or operations in proximity to the 
international borders (air, maritime, and land) of the United States, to 
include U.S. territories.
    b.  Commands will not add or change deployment dates, training dates, 
schedule of events, area of operations, or missions to support LMT.
    c.  With the exception of man-hours required to manage LMT portal access 
for Navy personnel to facilitate information exchange with DHS, commands will 
not purchase equipment or incur any additional costs to support LMT.
    d.  Commands will document all training events and operational activities 
that provide opportunities to support LMT or otherwise provide relevant 
information to civilian law enforcement officials.
    e.  FFC and PACFLT will provide an annual summary to OPNAV N3/N5 to 
satisfy the reporting requirements in reference (a).

4.  Direct questions regarding this NAVADMIN to the Navy Continuity of 
Operations (COOP) and Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) office.
    a.  Mr. Kenneth Denham, Branch Head Navy COOP and DSCA, at e-mail:  
kenneth.denham(at)navy.mil.
    b.  Mr. Matthew Fleisher, Deputy Branch Head Navy COOP and DSCA at 
e-mail:  matthew.fleisher(at)navy.mil.
