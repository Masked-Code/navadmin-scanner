RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the commencement of Block Learning (BL), the 
first evolutionary stage in the transformation to Ready Relevant Learning 
(RRL) as discussed in reference (a), and required organizational supporting 
actions.  BL training is critical to individual and unit readiness, and the 
individual career progression of a Sailor.

2.  Background:  BL redistributes accession training over the first 
operational tours.  The current accession training (A and C schools) is 
modularized to build proficiency when needed based on Fleet identified and 
validated training requirements.  The BL sequence is:
    a.  The Sailor completes initial training at Recruit Training Command 
("Boot Camp").
    b.  The Sailor completes initial technical training.  The first Block of 
technical training delivered during the accession pipeline is labeled Block 0 
(BL0).
    c.  The Sailor reports to their first operational unit sooner with all 
the knowledge and skills required for the first two years on board.
    d.  The Sailor returns to the schoolhouse for Block 1 (BL1) training 12 
to 24 months from the date they reported to their first operational Unit for 
2 to 5 weeks.
    e.  The Sailor returns to the original operational unit with expanded 
knowledge and skills.

3.  Scope:  BL training went into effect in FY17.  Logistics Specialists (LS) 
transitioned in May 2017 to the BL0 and BL1 construct.  These Sailors will 
start returning to BL1 in May 2018. Other ratings will follow, with all 
ratings identified for BL transitioning during FY18.  The term unit as used 
in this message refers to the first afloat or ashore fleet assignment for a 
Sailor.

4.  Action:  All Units will ensure Sailors with BL1 training requirements 
obtain and attend required training in line with reference (b) and paragraph 
5 below.

5.  Block 1 (BL1) Quota and Cost Orders Management:
    a.  Training Support Centers at Hampton Roads and San Diego working with 
unit training officers will manage the BL1 quota and cost orders process to 
include providing the temporary additional duty (TAD) funding when cost 
orders are required to return the Sailor to BL1 training.  This detailed step 
by step process is contained in reference (b) which includes the Training 
Support Center Standard Operating Procedure and Unit User's Guide which can 
be found at: 
https://mpte.navy.deps.mil/sites/Projects/rrl_projectoffice/ProjectD
ocuments/BLOCK%20LEARNING%20BLOCK%20ONE%20QUOTA%20AND%20COST-
ORDERS%20MANAGEMENT%20Instruction.pdf.
    b.  Establishment of Unit training officer.  The primary point of contact 
with the Training Support Centers (TSC) is the Unit Training Officer.  Units 
without an assigned training officer billet will designate a collateral duty 
training officer in writing to fulfill this function.  Assignment in the 
Unit's collateral duty notice meets this requirement.
    c.  Establishment of Unit Training Officer e-mail address. Units shall 
establish an email address for use by their training officer by 1 May 2018 to 
communicate requirements to the BL managers:  TSC Hampton Roads for commands 
east of the Mississippi river and Training Support Center San Diego for 
commands west of the Mississippi river.  The following format will be used by 
fleet Units:  traino(at)activityshorttitle.navy.mil.  For Units that use
NMCI/ONENET establish a functional account or functional mailbox in
line with that systems policy for using such mail boxes.  For NMCI
use the following format:  traino_activityshorttitle(at)navy.mil.
For ONENET use the following format: 
traino_activityshorttitle(at)youraor.navy.mil where "your aor" would either 
be eu/me/fe.  For any systems/activities that cannot follow this email 
address guidance for training officers contact the Naval Education and 
Training Command (NETC) N34 point of contact below.
    d.  Training Officer Tools:  Fleet Management and Planning System 
(FLTMPS) is the primary means for monitoring BL training quota and orders 
management by the Unit and TSCs to include requesting TAD funding.  The 
Enterprise Navy Training Reservations System (ENTRS), a sub-component of the 
Corporate enterprise Training
Activity Resource System (CeTARS) is the primary means for Units to request 
quota reservations for BL1 training courses.  FLTMPS and
ENTRS training are available from TSC Hampton Roads and San Diego.
    e.  Training Window.  BL1 training is targeted for 24 months after the 
Sailor reports to their unit minus 12 months.  This window allows the 
training officer to assess the BL1 requirement and request quotas that fit 
well within the commands employment schedule.
