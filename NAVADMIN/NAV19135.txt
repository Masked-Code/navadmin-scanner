SUBJ/2019 NUCLEAR AND SUBMARINE ENLISTED RETENTION SURVEY (CORRECTED COPY//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the 2019 Nuclear and Submarine Enlisted 
Retention Survey for Active-Duty Sailors.  This survey is sponsored by 
Commander, Naval Air Forces and Commander, Submarine Forces as a valuable 
means of collecting information from nuclear- trained and submarine Sailors 
about factors that influence their decision to reenlist.  Survey data will 
enable the nuclear enterprise and submarine force leadership to make informed 
decisions, evaluate the impact of existing policies and programs and pulse 
opinions in advance of new and proposed initiatives.

2.  This survey is to be completed by Sailors between 4 and 18 years of 
service on sea or shore duty in surface and submarine nuclear ratings (EMN, 
ETN and MMN) and non-nuclear submarine ratings (CSS, ETR, ETV, FT, HM (NEC 
L01A), ITS, LSS, MMA, MMW, MT, STS and YNS).
The survey will be available through 30 September 2019 to provide adequate 
opportunity for Sailors onboard aircraft carriers and submarines to complete 
the survey when in-port internet connectivity is available.

3.  A link to the survey has been provided to aircraft carrier, submarine and 
shore commands and will be distributed to eligible personnel by command 
leadership.  A password is not required to participate in the survey.  
Eligible personnel who do not receive a link from their command are 
encouraged to contact the Nuclear Program Manager (OPNAV N133) via e-mail at 
nukeccc(at)navy.mil or bullnuke(at)navy.mil for verification eligibility and 
the link.
Completion of this survey is entirely voluntary and completely confidential.  
All responses will be held in confidence by Commander, Naval Air Force, U.S. 
Pacific Fleet, Commander, Naval Air Force Atlantic, Commander, Submarine 
Force Atlantic, Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, OPNAV N133, 
Commander, Navy Personnel Command, Nuclear Power and Submarine Assignment 
Branch (PERS-403) and Director, Naval Reactors.  Information provided will be 
statistically summarized with the responses of others and will not be 
attributable to any single individual or command.

4.  Command leadership support is critical to the success of this survey.  
Command leadership shall ensure Sailors are provided ample time to complete 
the survey.  Additionally, command leadership shall also ensure the widest 
dissemination of this information so Sailors are aware of the survey and its 
importance to the nuclear and submarine force of the Navy.

Manager, at (703) 604-5493/DSN 664 or via e-mail at lacy.lodmell(at)navy.mil,
