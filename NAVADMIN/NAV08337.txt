RMKS/1. THIS IS A NAVY AND MARINE CORPS COORDINATED MESSAGE TO ANNOUNCE 
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NGEN SPO.
2. THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS, AND THE 
COMMANDANT OF THE MARINE CORPS HAVE COLLABORATED TO CREATE THE NGEN SPO, 
UNDER THE DIRECTION OF AN ASSISTANT CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS
(ACNO) REPORTING TO NAVY AND MARINE CORPS SERVICE CHIEFS. PER REF A, 
THE DIRECTOR NGEN SPO WILL BE A FLAG OFFICER WITH A USMC O6 DEPUTY. PER 
REF B, RDML DAVID SIMPSON HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS INTERIM DIRECTOR, NGEN 
SPO; RADM JOHN GOODWIN WILL REPORT AS DIRECTOR IN MARCH 2009. COLONEL 
DAVID HAGOPIAN IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR.
3. REF A DESCRIBES THE MISSION, AUTHORITY, RESPONSIBILITIES, AND 
ORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS THE NGEN SPO WILL HAVE WITHIN DON FOR 
GUIDING DON ELEMENTS AND SERVICES TO MISSION ACCOMPLISHMENT. THE NGEN 
SPO SHALL SYNCHRONIZE THE NGEN IMPLEMENTATION WITH PRE- EXISTING 
NETWORK OPERATIONS TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE 
TRANSITION. THE NGEN SPO SHALL ENSURE THAT, UNTIL SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION 
TO THE NGEN ENVIRONMENT, APPROPRIATE RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES ARE 
EMPLOYED TO ENSURE OPERATIONAL VIABILITY OF AFFECTED SERVICE NETWORKS. 
IN ADDITION, THE NGEN SPO WILL WORK WITH THE RESOURCE SPONSORS TO 
RECONCILE AND PRIORITIZE COMPETING REQUIREMENTS WITHIN ESTABLISHED DON 
FISCAL CONSTRAINTS. THE NGEN SPO WILL ESTABLISH PROGRAM PRIORITIES, 
DEVELOP PROGRAM INPUTS, EXECUTE THE NGEN PROGRAM MANAGEMENT BUDGET AND 
SYNCHRONIZE ACQUISITION, OPERATIONS, SECURITY, AND TRANSITION FUNCTIONS 
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SERVICES TO ENSURE PROGRAM WHOLENESS. THE 
DURATION OF THE NGEN SPO STRUCTURE DEPENDS ON THE NEEDS OF THE SERVICES; 
IT IS INTENDED THAT THE NGEN SPO SHALL EXIST THROUGH TRANSITION AT 
WHICH POINT THE SERVICES MAY REEVALUATE THEIR PARTICIPATION AND SUPPORT 
OF THE NGEN SPO.
4. TO EXECUTE THE MISSION ASSIGNED IN REF A, THE NGEN SPO CONSISTS OF 
THREE DIVISIONS:

THIS REVIEW PROCESS TO ADEQUATELY CAPTURE ALL NGEN EQUITIES.
