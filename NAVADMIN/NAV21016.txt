RMKS/1.  Per reference (a), nominations are requested for the annual 
Department of Defense (DoD) Supply Chain Excellence Award.  Reference (b) 
provides guidelines for submission and can be found at

deter and decisively defeat our adversaries.  New threats to our national 
security demand that we transform logistics to project and sustain dominant 
power.  Transforming to more reliable, agile, and responsive defense 
logistics programs enables the use of best practices and innovative 
approaches to significantly improve the reliability, flexibility, and 
responsiveness of the defense supply chain and advance the DoD's overall 
supply chain management.

3.  The DoD Award for Supply Chain Excellence will recognize the organization 
that operates significant components of a supply chain and has demonstrated

implementation of the supply chain process categories as defined in reference
