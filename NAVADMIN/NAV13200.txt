Leadership Continuum to be held in Pensacola, FL on 24-26 September 2013. 
This event is designed for Navy and Marine Corps ATC leadership and managers.

place within the ATC profession. Among other topics to be discussed are 
updates to Naval Aviation, changes within the National Airspace System, new 
equipment capabilities, Navy enlisted classification codes, type commanders 
updates, tower and radar simulation, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
controller accreditation, community wholeness, and manpower metrics. Formal 
course reviews for ATC schools will be conducted.

3. This is mission essential and critical to the safety, training and 
operational readiness for all Navy and Marine Corps facilities ashore, afloat 
and expeditionary to participate in this event in order to effectively 
address FAA, International Civil Aviation Organization, and Naval ATC policy 
and procedures.
