QUARTER
OF FY-07 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS NAVADMIN WILL NOT
BE
PENALIZED IN SRB COMPUTATIONS FOR ANY MONTHS REMAINING ON AN

8.  THIS FTS SRB POLICY MODIFICATION IS INTENDED TO FACILITATE THE
APPROVAL
OF ELIGIBLE FTS SRB REQUESTS IN SEPTEMBER 2006 AND/OR THE FIRST
QUARTER OF
FY-07, SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS OF A CONTINUING RESOLUTION OR FY-07
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, WITHOUT UNDULY PENALIZING THE MEMBER IF THE

SPECIFIC
ZONE OR PRECEDING A RATING INDICATES AN INCREASE TO THAT AWARD LEVEL
FOR THAT
