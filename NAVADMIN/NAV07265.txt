RMKS/1. THIS YEAR'S ARMY/NAVY GAME IS SCHEDULED FOR SATURDAY,
1 DECEMBER 07 AT M&T BANK STADIUM, BALTIMORE, MD. CBS SPORTS WILL 
TELEVISE THE GAME AND WILL ONCE AGAIN ACCEPT "GO NAVY"
AND/OR "BEAT ARMY" VIDEO SPOTS FROM THE NAVY/MARINE CORPS TEAM FOR 
BROADCAST DURING THE GAME. THIS TRADITIONAL FOOTBALL GAME OFFERS AN 
EXCITING OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR SAILORS AND MARINES TO DISPLAY THEIR TEAM 
SPIRIT BEFORE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS.
2. REQUIREMENTS: ALL SPOTS MUST INCLUDE THE SUBMITTING COMMAND'S NAME, 
IDENTIFY COMMAND'S LOCATION, AND INCLUDE A "GO NAVY" AND/OR "BEAT ARMY"

C. VHS TAPES AND DVDS CREATED FROM VHS, HI-8, DIGITAL HI-8 OR CONSUMER 
GRADE VIDEO CAMERAS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE.

MOST LIKELY TO BE TELEVISED ARE THOSE EXHIBITING ENTHUSIASM, HUMOR, 
CREATIVITY, AND MOTIVATION. THIS YEAR WE ARE LOOKING FOR MORE SKITS,

EDIT SUBMISSIONS.

SAME AT THE END OF THE SPOT.

WAS A PRIMARY REASON FOR REJECTION OF PAST ENTRIES.

PERMISSIBLE ON A NOT-TO-INTERFERE WITH OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS BASIS.
