RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces selections for the FY-14 Seaman to
Admiral-21 (STA-21) Program.  STA-21 is the premier commissioning source 
providing the highest levels of education and leadership training for our 
Sailors.  These highly motivated men and women will 
be among the leaders of our Navy well into the 21st century.   Over 
469 highly competitive applications were received from well-qualified 
Sailors; this made this year's application selection a difficult task.  
All who applied should be very proud of their accomplishments and continue 
their outstanding performance to ensure professional growth and increase 
their chance of selection in a future board.  
Congratulations to all those selected.

4.  Selections are conditional upon the selectee remaining fully eligible in 
all respects, meeting physical qualifications for commissioning as determined 
by Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED 25), and assignment by Naval Service 
Training Command (NSTC) to an approved Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps 
(NROTC) affiliated university based upon an official degree plan and 
acceptance letter from the university.  Upon completion of an NSTC approved 
baccalaureate degree program, selectees will receive appointments as ensigns, 
U.S. Navy.

5.  Commanding officers should take the following actions:
    a.  Notify selectees and alternates of their selection and ensure they 
receive a copy of this message.
    b.  Notify NSTC (OD2/STA-21) and Navy Personnel Command
(PERS-4801G) via message NLT 8 November 2013 of any selectee or alternate who 
does not desire to participate in the program.
    c.  Immediately report to NSTC (OD2/STA-21) all conditions/circumstances 
that may disqualify a selectee or alternate from participating in the STA-21 
Program via e-mail at PNSC_STA21(at)navy.mil.

6.  Selectees and alternates should take the following actions:
    a.  Complete a physical examination for a training program leading to a 
commission in the Unrestricted Line, Nurse Corps, or Civil Engineering Corps, 
as applicable, in accordance with refs (a) and (b) at a military treatment 
facility.  Note that many commissioning standards exceed the enlisted 
standards required to remain on active-duty.
    b.  Ensure copies of completed physicals (DD Form 2807-1 and DD Form 
2808), including HIV results from a test taken after
1 January 2013, are submitted NLT 2 December 2013 to:
    Naval Service Training Command
    Attn:  OD2/STA-21
    250 Dallas Street, Suite A 
    Pensacola, Florida 32508-5268
Aviation option selectees/alternates must submit physical forms (SF 507, 
OPNAV 3710/37a, EKG printout) and HIV results from a test taken after 1 
January 2013.  All required physical forms can be downloaded from the STA-21 
homepage at http://www.sta-21.navy.mil.  
Commands should not forward physical forms directly to BUMED.
    c.  Send acceptance letters from no more than three NROTC host or NROTC 
cross-town affiliated universities to the NSTC address listed above.  
Application to more than one university is advisable since only a limited 
number of selectees will be placed at each NROTC unit.  Selectees will begin 
the STA-21 Program with attendance to the Naval Science Institute (NSI), NLT 
17 February 2014.
    d.  Send an official degree plan from an NROTC host or NROTC cross-town 
affiliated university where they have been accepted.  
Degree plans must cover the time actually attending college.  
Selectee's degree plans should begin with the summer term 2014.  
All STA-21 selectees will be required to attend the NSI enroute to their 
assigned university.

7.  Alternates:  While there is no guarantee that an alternate will be 
offered the opportunity to replace a primary selectee, each alternate must 
complete the same actions outlined in paragraph 6 of this message.  If a 
primary selectee declines participation in the program, is determined not to 
be physically qualified or otherwise becomes ineligible for continuation in 
the program prior to executing orders, a qualified alternate will be 
selected.  This notification often comes at the last minute; therefore, 
alternates need to be prepared when notified.

8.  The deadline for required degree plans and college admission 
documentation is 22 December 2013.  It is in the best interest of each 
selectee and alternate to submit verification of eligibility criteria as soon 
as possible to expedite university assignment and release of permanent change 
of station orders.  Selectees will not be ordered to the NSI en route to 
their assigned NROTC university until all conditions outlined in paragraph 6 
have been met.

9.  Points of contact are Mr. Paros at (850) 452-9563/DSN 459 or Mr. Straten 
at (850) 452-9433/DSN 459.
