SUBJ/2008 ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH// 
RMKS/1.  WE WILL OBSERVE ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH DURING 
MAY 2008.  THE THEME FOR THIS YEAR'S OBSERVANCE IS "LEADERSHIP, 
DIVERSITY, HARMONY - GATEWAY TO SUCCESS."
2.  ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED IN 1977 
WHEN REPRESENTATIVES FRANK HORTON AND NORMAN MINETA, AS WELL AS 
SENATORS DANIEL INOUYE AND SPARK MATSUNAGA INTRODUCED RESOLUTIONS 
ASKING THE PRESIDENT TO DECLARE THE FIRST TEN DAYS OF MAY (THE MONTH 
WHEN THE FIRST JAPANESE IMMIGRANTS ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES IN 
1843) AS ASIAN PACIFIC HERITAGE WEEK.  IN 1978 PRESIDENT CARTER MADE IT 
AN ANNUAL EVENT, AND IN 1990 PRESIDENT GEORGE H. W. BUSH PROCLAIMED THE 
ENTIRE MONTH OF MAY TO BE ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH.
3.  ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICANS, INCLUDING THOSE FROM CAMBODIA, CHINA, 
INDONESIA, INDIA, JAPAN, KOREA, LAOS, MICRONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES, 
POLYNESIA, THAILAND, VIETNAM, AND MANY OTHER ASIAN AND PACIFIC LANDS, 
HAVE LONG SERVED WITH DISTINCTION IN THE ARMED FORCES.  IN 1915 FIREMAN 
SECOND CLASS TELESFORO TRINIDAD RECEIVED THE MEDAL OF HONOR FOR 
EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM IN USS SAN DIEGO.  IN 1985 COMMANDER TEM BUGARIN 
BECAME THE FIRST FILIPINO TO COMMAND A SURFACE SHIP, USS SAGINAW.
TODAY, OVER 23,000 ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICANS SERVE PROUDLY IN THE NAVY.
4.  ALL HANDS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO INCREASE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND 
AWARENESS OF DIVERSITY BY CELEBRATING ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE 
MONTH THROUGH PROGRAMS, EXHIBITS, PUBLICATIONS, AND PARTICIPATION IN
