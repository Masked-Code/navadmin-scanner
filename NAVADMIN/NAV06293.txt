SUBJ/ELLIPTICAL TRAINER AS NEW PHYSICAL READINESS TEST (PRT) CARDIO
OPTION//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  BEGINNING WITH THE SPRING 2007 PHYSICAL FITNESS
ASSESSMENT (PFA) CYCLE, USE OF THE ELLIPTICAL TRAINER IS APPROVED AS
AN ALTERNATE CARDIO RESPIRATORY TEST OPTION FOR THE 1.5 MILE RUN.
AS WITH THE SWIM AND TREADMILL, AUTHORIZATION TO TEST USING THE
ELLIPTICAL TRAINER IS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE CO/OIC.  WITH THE
EVER-INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF INDIVIDUAL READINESS AND OUR CULTURE
OF FITNESS, THE ADDITION OF THE ELLIPTICAL TRAINER AS A TESTING
OPTION IS SIGNIFICANT FOR THE NAVY IN THAT IT AIDS IN SUPPORTING
OUR SAILORS AND COMMANDS IN MAINTAINING A FIT, FULLY CAPABLE AND
MISSION-READY FORCE.
2.  THE ELLIPTICAL TRAINER PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL TESTING OPTION
THAT CHALLENGES THE CARDIO RESPIRATORY SYSTEM EQUAL TO THE RUN BUT
WITH LESS IMPACT TO LOWER EXTREMITIES.  THE ONLY AUTHORIZED
ELLIPTICAL TRAINERS FOR OFFICIAL PRT TESTING WILL BE THE LIFE
FITNESS (MODELS CT 9500 HR, 95 XI, 91 XI AND 91 X), PRECOR (MODEL
EFX-NAVY), AND NAUTILUS (MODEL E9 16).  MEMBERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO
USE ANY TYPE OF ELLIPTICAL TRAINER FOR AEROBIC ACTIVITY WHEN WORKING
OUT TO IMPROVE THEIR READINESS, FITNESS, AND OVERALL HEALTH AND
WELLNESS.
3.  THE ELLIPTICAL TRAINER TEST WILL BE A 12-MINUTE FIXED-TIME TEST
WHICH PERMITS A DIRECT CORRELATION OF THE ELLIPTICAL TEST RESULTS TO
THE 1.5 MILE RUN (THE DOD STANDARD TO MEASURE AEROBIC FITNESS).  THE
ELLIPTICAL TRAINER TEST WILL PROVIDE THE MEMBER S CALORIC OUTPUT,
WHICH WILL BE CONVERTED INTO A RUN TIME.  THE RUN PERFORMANCE
STANDARD CHARTS, ALREADY LOCATED IN THE PHYSICAL READINESS PROGRAM
POLICY, OPNAVINST 6110.1H, WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE THE PRT SCORE.
THE GOAL IS TO BURN AS MANY CALORIES AS POSSIBLE DURING THE
12-MINUTE TEST.
4.  SPECIFIC TESTING PROCEDURES ON THE AUTHORIZED ELLIPTICAL
TRAINERS WILL BE PROMULGATED VIA NAVADMIN BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR
YEAR.  AFTER 1 JANUARY 2007, RUN TIME CONVERSION FORMULAS WILL BE
PROGRAMMED INTO PRIMS.  RUN TIME CONVERSION CHARTS, CALORIC OUTPUT
GOAL CHARTS, TESTING PROCEDURES AND ANSWERS TO FREQUENTLY ASKED
QUESTIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE ON THE PHYSICAL READINESS PROGRAM OFFICE
WEBSITE, WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/COMMANDSUPPORT/PHYSICALREADINESS, AND
INCORPORATED INTO THE NEXT REVISION OF OPNAVINST 6110.1H.
5.  ELLIPTICAL TRAINERS REDUCE THE SHOCKS ASSOCIATED WITH GROUND
CONTACT BY THE FOOT AND DECREASE THE RISK OF FURTHER MUSCULOSKELETAL
DAMAGE TO THOSE WITH PREVIOUS LOWER EXTREMITY INJURIES.  THE 1.5
MILE RUN REMAINS THE NAVY STANDARD AND, IF MEDICALLY CLEARED,
MEMBERS SHALL PARTICIPATE IN THE 1.5 MILE RUN/WALK UNLESS THE CO
AUTHORIZES AN ALTERNATE CARDIO OPTION.  SAILORS WHO ARE MEDICALLY
WAIVED FROM THE CARDIO EVENT OF THE PRT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO TEST
WITH THE TREADMILL, SWIM, OR ELLIPTICAL TRAINER; HOWEVER, THEY ARE
REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN PERSONAL PHYSICAL FITNESS BY REGULAR EXERCISE
AND PROPER NUTRITION AND ARE ENCOURAGED TO VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATE
IN ONE OF THE THREE PRT CARDIO OPTIONS.
