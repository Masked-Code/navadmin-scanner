SUBJ/POST DEPLOYMENT HEALTH RE-ASSESSMENT ACCOUNTABILITY//

REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/12JAN2009//
AMPN/REF A IS OPNAV INSTRUCTION 6100.3, DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT 
PROCESS.//

RMKS/1.  THE POST-DEPLOYMENT HEALTH RE-ASSESSMENT (PDHRA) (DD 2900), 
A VITAL PART OF THE DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT (DHA) PROCESS, IS 
DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH INJURIES 
DURING THE CRITICAL TIME PERIOD FOLLOWING CERTAIN DEPLOYMENTS.  THIS 
NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES NEW PDHRA ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND PROVIDES A 
REVIEW OF THE DHA PROCESS.  

2.  THIS NAVADMIN ALSO DIRECTS NAVY COMMANDS CONDUCT A ONE-TIME 
SCREENING OF MEDICAL RECORDS FOR DHA COMPLIANCE FOR ALL PERSONNEL 
WHO HAVE COMPLETED A QUALIFYING DEPLOYMENT UNDER REF A.  PROCEDURES 
FOR THIS ONE-TIME SCREENING ARE PROVIDED IN PARA 10 OF THIS MESSAGE.  
FOR JOINT COMMANDS, REQUEST THE NAVY ELEMENT COMMANDER CONTACT THE 
UNITED STATES FLEET FORCES COMMAND (USFF) DHA POC LISTED IN PARA 11 
IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THIS ONE-TIME SCREENING FOR NAVY PERSONNEL 
ASSIGNED TO THEIR JOINT COMMAND.

3.  THE NAVY CONTINUES TO TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE COMPLIANCE WITH THE 
PDHRA REQUIREMENT AS DEFINED IN REF A.  HOWEVER, APPROXIMATELY 30 
PERCENT OF NAVY PERSONNEL FAIL TO COMPLETE THE PDHRA IN THE TIME 
PERIOD PRESCRIBED.  ADDITIONAL EFFORT IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE OUR 
SAILORS RECEIVE THE NECESSARY SCREENINGS TO IDENTIFY HEALTH 
CONCERNS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE FURTHER ASSESSMENT OR TREATMENT.  
COMMANDERS, COMMANDING OFFICERS, AND OFFICERS IN CHARGE MUST PAY 
PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THIS REQUIREMENT AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
ENSURING PDHRA COMPLIANCE.  

4.  PDHRA ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES:  USFF, ASSIGNED BY REF A AS THE 
CNO'S EXECUTIVE AGENT FOR DEPLOYMENT HEALTH, HAS INCREASED THE 
FREQUENCY OF REPORTING PDHRA COMPLIANCE FROM QUARTERLY TO MONTHLY.  
REPORTS TO THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS WILL NOW HIGHLIGHT 
COMPLIANCE RATES BY INDIVIDUAL ECHELON II COMMANDS AND BUDGET 
SUBMITTING OFFICES (BSO).  COMPLIANCE RATES BELOW 80 PERCENT WILL BE 
DESIGNATED "UNSATISFACTORY" AND RATES BETWEEN 80 PERCENT AND 95 
PERCENT WILL BE DESIGNATED "NEEDS IMPROVEMENT".  ALL NAVY ECHELON II 
COMMANDS AND BSOS SHALL PROVIDE A DHA REPORTING POC TO THE USFF POC 
IDENTIFIED IN PARA 11 BY 31 JAN 12.  FOR JOINT COMMANDS, REQUEST THE 
NAVY ELEMENT COMMANDER PROVIDE A DHA REPORTING POC TO THE USFF POC 
IDENTIFIED IN PARA 11 BY 31 JAN 12.

5.  DHA REQUIREMENTS:  DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENTS ARE REQUIRED BY 
REF A FOR OCONUS DEPLOYMENTS ASHORE FOR GREATER THAN 30 DAYS WITHOUT 
A FIXED MILITARY TREATMENT FACILITY (MTF) OR WHEN REQUIRED BY THE 
COMBATANT COMMANDER (COCOM) OR UNIT COMMANDER.  THE COCOMS LISTED 
BELOW CURRENTLY HAVE THE FOLLOWING STANDING REQUIREMENTS:
    A.  THE CENTCOM INDIVIDUAL DEPLOYMENT POLICY (MOD 11) REQUIRES 
DHAS FOR ALL PERSONNEL TRAVELING TO OR THROUGH THE CENTCOM AREA OF 
RESPONSIBILITY (AOR) WITH TIME IN COUNTRY OF MORE THAN 30 DAYS.
    B.  SOUTHCOM REQUIRES DHAS FOR ALL PERSONNEL REPORTING TO JOINT 
TASK FORCE-GUANTANAMO BAY.

6.  DHA TIMELINE:  DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENTS ARE COMPLETED AT 
CRITICAL TIMES IN THE DEPLOYMENT PROCESS.  THE PRE-DEPLOYMENT HEALTH 
ASSESSMENT (PRE-DHA, DD 2795) IS PERFORMED NO MORE THAN 60 DAYS 
PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT.  THE POST DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT (PDHA DD 
2796) IS COMPLETED WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE RETURN DATE.  THE PDHRA, DD 
2900 IS COMPLETED BETWEEN 90-180 DAYS AFTER THE RETURN DATE.

7.  DHA COMPLETION PROCESS:
    A.  DHA COMPLETION IS A TWO PART PROCESS.  PART 1 CONSISTS OF 
THE SAILOR COMPLETING AN ASSESSMENT IN THE NAVY'S ONLINE ELECTRONIC 
DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT (EDHA) TOOL.  TO GAIN ACCESS TO EDHA, 
CONTACT YOUR MEDICAL PROVIDER.  PART 2 CONSISTS OF THE SAILOR BEING 
INTERVIEWED BY A MEDICAL PROVIDER, TYPICALLY AT AN MTF, WHO WILL 
REVIEW THE DHA, CERTIFY THE DHA AS COMPLETE IN EDHA AND MAKE 
REFERRALS AS NECESSARY.  THE DHA IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL THE PROVIDER 
CERTIFIES IT IN EDHA.
    B.  SAILORS WITHOUT AN MTF OR OTHER APPROVED DOD MEDICAL 
ORGANIZATION NEAR THEIR HOME OR DUTY STATION MAY EXECUTE PART 2 VIA 
THE PDHRA CALL CENTER AT 1-888-734-7299 TO COMPLETE THE ASSESSMENT 
OVER THE PHONE WITH A MEDICAL PROVIDER FOR CERTIFICATION.

8.  COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR PDHRA COMPLIANCE:
    A.  MONITOR ON A MONTHLY BASIS THE PDHRA REQUIREMENT FOR MEMBERS 
OF THE COMMAND IDENTIFIED BY THE MEDICAL READINESS REPORTING SYSTEM 
(MRRS).  COMMANDS WITHOUT ACCESS TO MRRS SHOULD CONTACT THEIR 
IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR IN COMMAND (ISIC) TO OBTAIN MRRS REPORTS BY 
INDIVIDUAL UIC.  JOINT COMMANDS REQUIRING MRRS ACCESS SHOULD CONTACT 
THE USFF POC LISTED IN PARA 11.
    B.  KNOW THE DEPLOYMENT HISTORIES OF THE SAILORS IN THE COMMAND 
AND ENSURE ALL DHA REQUIREMENTS IN REF A ARE MET FOR PERSONNEL WHO 
EXECUTED QUALIFYING DEPLOYMENTS.
    C.  VALIDATE DHA COMPLETION AS PART OF THE CHECK-IN, CHECK-OUT 
PROCESS PER REF A.

9.  SAILOR NOTIFICATION:  SAILORS CAN VIEW THEIR PDHRA STATUS AS 
PART OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEDICAL READINESS (IMR) STATUS ON BUPERS ON-
LINE (BOL).  WHEN THE PDHRA STATUS INDICATES DUE OR OVERDUE, SAILORS 
SHOULD CONTACT THEIR MEDICAL PROVIDER TO COMPLETE THEIR PDHRA.  TO 
ASSIST SAILORS INDICATED BY MRRS AS REQUIRING A PDHRA, USFF IS 
SENDING MONTHLY EMAIL REMINDERS TO ALL PERSONNEL WHO ARE DUE OR 
OVERDUE.  SAILORS RECEIVING THESE EMAILS SHOULD TAKE IMMEDIATE 
ACTION AND CONTACT MEDICAL FOR PDHRA COMPLETION.

10.  TO ACCOMPLISH THE ONE-TIME MEDICAL RECORD REVIEW OF SAILORS WHO 
HAVE COMPLETED A QUALIFYING DEPLOYMENT, NAVY COMMANDERS ARE DIRECTED 
TO PERFORM THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS:
    A.  ACCESS MRRS TO DETERMINE MEMBERS OF THE COMMAND WHO REQUIRE 
DHAS.  FOR SAILORS WHO REQUIRE DHAS, VERIFY THE COMPLETION OF THE DD 
2900 FOR THE SAILOR'S MOST RECENT DEPLOYMENT.
    B.  IF COMPLETION OF DD 2900 IS NOT REFLECTED IN MRRS, BUT A 
PAPER COPY IS PRESENT IN SAILOR'S MEDICAL RECORD, TRANSFER THE 
INFORMATION TO AN ELECTRONIC DD 2900 AND SUBMIT VIA EDHA.
    C.  IF THE SERVICE MEMBER HAS NOT COMPLETED A DD 2900, DIRECT 
COMPLETION PER PROCEDURES IN PARA 7.
    D.  THIS REVIEW SHALL BE COMPLETED NLT 15 FEB 12 TO ENSURE THE 
MRRS DATA ACCURATELY REFLECTS DHA COMPLIANCE.  ECHELON II COMMANDERS 
AND NAVY ELEMENT COMMANDERS (JOINT COMMANDS) SHALL REPORT COMPLETION 
OF THIS REVIEW TO THE USFF POC LISTED IN PARA 11.
