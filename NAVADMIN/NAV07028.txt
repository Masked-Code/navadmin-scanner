SUBJ/CNO GUIDANCE FOR 2007 - FOCUS ON EXECUTION// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  I HAVE RELEASED MY GUIDANCE FOR 2007 AND POSTED IT 
ONLINE AT WWW.NAVY.MIL.
2.  THE GUIDANCE REINFORCES OUR 2006 VISION, MISSION AND GUIDING 
PRINCIPLES, ASSESSES OUR PROGRESS TOWARD OUR PRIORITIES, AND CALLS FOR 
ACCOUNTABLE EXECUTION OF KEY OBJECTIVES.  MY PRIORITIES HAVE NOT 
CHANGED. WE WILL SUSTAIN OUR READINESS FOR THE WAR ON TERROR AND ANY 
OTHER ARMED CONFLICT; WE WILL BUILD A FLEET FOR THE FUTURE OF THE RIGHT 
SIZE AND MIX OF CAPABILITIES; AND WE WILL DEVELOP 21ST CENTURY LEADERS 
THROUGH A TRANSFORMED MANPOWER, PERSONNEL, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION 
ORGANIZATION.
3.  AS I EMPHASIZE THROUGHOUT THE DOCUMENT, WE REMAIN A NATION AND A 
NAVY AT WAR.  WHILE WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTRIBUTE 
TO THE WAR EFFORT, WE MUST ALSO RECOGNIZE OUR VERY REAL 
RESPONSIBILITIES -- OUR ENDURING MISSION -- TO DETER MAJOR CONFLICT AND, 
IF NEED BE, FIGHT AND WIN AT SEA.  OURS IS A DANGEROUS WORLD.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXPECT US TO DELIVER GLOBAL REACH AND PERSISTENT 
PRESENCE AND TO SERVE AS A VITAL ELEMENT OF OUR NATION S "STRATEGIC 
RESERVE."  WE WILL MEET THOSE EXPECTATIONS.
4.  WE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARD OUR PRIORITIES IN 2006, AND I 
OFFER A SHORT ASSESSMENT OF THAT GOOD WORK IN THE DOCUMENT.  WE ARE ON 
THE RIGHT COURSE, BUT WE MUST FOCUS ON EXECUTION.  WE MUST FOLLOW 
THROUGH ON EVERY PLAN, BUDGET DECISION, STRATEGY AND POLICY WE HAVE 
DEVISED TO BETTER DEFEND OUR NATION AND OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS.  TO 
THAT END, I ALSO OUTLINE THREE MAJOR FOCUS AREAS FOR LEADERS IN 2007, 
ONE UNDER EACH OF THE THREE PRIORITIES.
5.  UNDER "SUSTAINING COMBAT READINESS" WE WILL FOCUS ON WARFIGHTING.  
THE FREEDOM TO CONDUCT NAVAL OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF JOINT, ALLIED AND 
COALITION OPERATIONS -- ASSURING ACCESS AND PROJECTING PERSISTENT 
COMBAT POWER -- MUST BE PRESERVED THROUGH ENDURING, WARFIGHTING 
COMPETENCIES.  THE NAVY ENTERPRISE FRAMEWORK WE ARE IMPLEMENTING WILL 
REDUCE THE COST OF MAINTAINING WARFIGHTING READINESS WHILE INCREASING 
THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS WITH WHICH IT IS DELIVERED.  WE WILL 
ALSO WORK HARD TO IMPROVE OUR INTERDEPENDENCE WITH THE MARINE CORPS, 
COAST GUARD, OTHER SERVICES AND INTER-AGENCIES.  WE CAN NEVER FORGET 
THAT WE ARE AND WILL REMAIN A WARFIGHTING, SEAGOING SERVICE.
6.  UNDER "BUILDING A FLEET FOR THE FUTURE" WE WILL FOCUS ON 
PARTNERSHIPS.  WHENEVER AND WHEREVER THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS, WE MUST 
DEVELOP AND SUSTAIN RELATIONSHIPS THAT IMPROVE THE CAPACITY OF OUR 
EMERGING AND ENDURING PARTNERS  MARITIME FORCES TO ACHIEVE COMMON 
DESIRED EFFECTS.  WHILE MINDFUL OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF OUR PARTNERS, WE 
MUST ENCOURAGE NATIONS TO PROVIDE SECURITY WITHIN THEIR TERRITORIAL 
WATERS AND TO SEAL SEAMS BETWEEN NEIGHBORS.  THIS GETS TO THE HEART OF 
THE "1,000-SHIP NAVY" CONCEPT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE.
7.  UNDER "DEVELOP 21ST CENTURY LEADERS" WE WILL FOCUS ON DIVERSITY.
I CONSIDER DIVERSITY A STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE FOR OUR NAVY AND VITAL TO 
OUR ABILITY TO ACCOMPLISH THE MISSION.  THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE TODAY, 
WHEN UNDERSTANDING THE MORES, CUSTOMS AND IDEALS OF DIVERSE CULTURES, 
AS WELL AS THE PERSPECTIVES OF OTHER PEOPLE, REMAINS CRITICAL TO 
WINNING THE LONG WAR.  WE WILL DRIVE TO EXECUTION OF THE DIVERSITY 
CONOPS IN 2007 AND WILL REFOCUS OUR ENERGIES ON RECRUITING, DEVELOPING, 
EDUCATING AND RETAINING LEADERS FROM AND FOR ALL PARTS OF OUR NAVY AND 
NATION.
8.  THE NAVY IS DOING GREAT THINGS.  OUR PERFORMANCE IN COMBAT AND 
COMBAT SUPPORT OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, DISASTER RELIEF, 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND THEATER SECURITY COOPERATION OPERATIONS 
SPEAK VOLUMES ABOUT THE VALUE OF WELL-TRAINED, COMBAT-READY NAVAL 
FORCES.  THE NEW MARITIME STRATEGY WE ARE CRAFTING WILL REFLECT THAT 
VALUE AND STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE ENDURING REQUIREMENTS FOR 
TRADITIONAL NAVAL CAPABILITIES WITH THOSE NEEDED TO SQUARELY CONFRONT 
AND INFLUENCE THE HIGHLY DYNAMIC SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OF THE 21ST 
CENTURY.
9.  I AM ENORMOUSLY PROUD OF OUR SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR 
DEDICATION TO DEFENDING OUR GREAT NATION.  BUT WE CANNOT REST ON 
LAURELS.  TO PACE GLOBAL CHANGE AND ACHIEVE THE SPEED OF WAR, WE MUST 
CONTINUALLY MONITOR FLEETING INDICATORS, ANTICIPATE FUTURE TRENDS, 
ACCURATELY MEASURE OUR PROGRESS AND EXECUTE ACCORDING TO PLAN. IT IS 
WITH THAT CHALLENGE SQUARELY IN MIND THAT I WROTE MY GUIDANCE FOR 2007.  
I ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ IT, DISTRIBUTE IT AND DISCUSS IT.  AS ALWAYS, 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE DURING THIS CRITICAL TIME IN OUR NATION S 
HISTORY AND FOR YOUR SUPPORT.
