RMKS/1.  The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) announces the 2023 CNO Naval 
History Essay Contest and calls for the submission of papers no later than 31 
May 2023. 
 
2.  The Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC) is the lead for the 
contest, and the U.S. Naval Institute (which has been sponsoring essay 
contests since 1878) is supporting. 
 
3.  The CNO invites entrants to submit essays that apply lessons from 
throughout naval history to solving today's Navy challenges.  Entrants should 
consider that today's era is marked by: 
    a.  Determined and increasingly aggressive efforts by China and Russia to 
    coordinate their respective instruments of power (e.g., economic, 
political, 
    and military) to compete for commercial, geostrategic, political, and 
military advantage and access. 
    b.  Chinese and Russian expansion across the spectrum of military 
operations (competition, crisis, and contingency) and domains (sea, air, 
land, space,cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum). 
    c.  The rise of China as an economic and maritime power and the 
importance of the maritime domain as well as the need for the U.S. to 
integrate Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard operations and multi-domain 
operational concepts and capabilities. 
    d.  The increased importance of navies, sea control, and allies and 
partners in a globalized world where 90 percent of world trade (by volume) 
and information travels via the seas or undersea cables. 
    e.  The proliferation of advanced weaponry and the erosion of key U.S. 
technological advantages that make it difficult for the U.S. to project power 
to manage crises, deter aggression, and reassure allies and partners. 
    f.  Fundamental strategic and technological shifts and advances that 
promise to change the character and conduct of naval warfare and challenge 
the Navy's ability to adapt conceptually and materially. 
 
4.  CNOs Intent:  Engage and leverage the intellectual talents of the members 
of the U.S. maritime services (i.e., the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard 
as well as the Merchant Marine) and students, as defined below, to provide 
insights and catalyze discussion on how to establish and maintain maritime 
superiority in an era of great power competition.
