TRAINING// 
 
REF/A/DOC/BUPERS/1DEC21// 
AMPN/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1610.10F, NAVY PERFORMANCE EVALUATION SYSTEM.// 
 
RMKS/1.  The purpose of this NAVADMIN is to reinforce and refocus efforts 
around the current mid-term performance counseling practices which serves as 
a key component of the Navys performance evaluation system.  In line with 
reference (a), supervisors are required to conduct performance counseling 
with their Sailors at least twice per year - at the midpoint of the periodic 
report cycle and when the report is signed. 
 
2.  The Chief of Naval Personnel (CNP) is dedicated to the improvement of 
performance counseling Navy-wide.  Updates to mid- term performance 
counseling have been documented in chapter 18 of the recently released update 
to reference (a).  The instruction provides the following updates: 
    a.  Clarifies that mid-term performance counseling is mandatory. 
    b.  Instructs members and supervisors on how to prepare for mid-term 
counseling. 
    c.  Instructs members and supervisors on how to conduct and receive  
mid-term counseling. 
    d.  Instructs members and supervisors on how to give and receive feedback 
during performance counseling. 
    e.  Introduces the use of the Military Individual Development Plan (IDP) 
(NAVPERS 1610/19) as an optional tool to track progress on established 
professional and personal goals. 
    f.  Introduces the use of the Mid-term Counseling Checklist (NAVPERS 
1610/20) to serve as a guide to help organize, prepare and conduct 
performance counseling conversations. 
    g.  Preparation requirements for both the supervisor and member prior to 
conducting the performance counseling session. 
    h.  Provides five steps for the supervisor to follow during a performance 
counseling session. 
    i.  Incorporates from the MyNavy Coaching Initiative the three core 
coach-like skills of active listening, empathy and asking powerful, open-
ended questions during performance counseling conversations. 
 
3.  Updates to reference (a) also includes training on mid-term performance 
counseling via a webinar comprised of four self-paced modules approximately 
90 minutes in length.  The training can be found at the MyNavy HR website: 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Performance-
Evaluation/MidTerm_Counseling/.  To maximize the value of performance 
counseling, it is recommended that all hands review this training within 90 
days of release of this NAVADMIN. 
 
4.  An infographic/kneeboard card with a list of five questions is provided 
for supervisors and members to reference during mid-term performance 
counseling conversations (*Engaging in Performance Counseling for 
Supervisors/Members*).  These questions serve as the foundation to promote 
greater member engagement and provide quality feedback to ensure open bi-
directional communication and increased self-awareness.  Members are 
encouraged to print their own infographic/kneeboard by visiting: 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Performance-
Evaluation/MidTerm_Counseling/. 
 
5.  Refocusing mid-term performance counseling will empower Sailors to take 
accountability for their own development.  Engaging in these developmental 
conversations ultimately will have an impact on winning the Strategic 
Competition and on retention - by keeping our most valuable assets - our 
Sailors in the Navy.  More importantly, great leaders lead by example, and we 
owe it to our Sailors to invest in their continued performance and growth.

whichever occurs first.
