RMKS/1.  THE NATION COMMENCES THE DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE FROM APRIL 11-18, 
2010.  ALSO KNOWN AS "YOM HASHOAH," OR HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY, APRIL 
11TH BEGINS A WEEK LONG COMMEMORATION OF THE HISTORY OF THE HOLOCAUST.  
THE NATIONAL THEME THIS YEAR IS "STORIES OF FREEDOM:
WHAT YOU DO MATTERS."

2.  CONGRESS ESTABLISHED THE "DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE" IN 1980 AS OUR 
NATION'S ANNUAL COMMEMORATION OF THE HOLOCAUST.  DURING THIS SOLEMN 
TIME WE REFLECT ON OVER A DECADE OF HORRIFIC PERSECUTION, TORTURE, AND 
GENOCIDE THAT TOOK THE LIVES OF MORE THAN 6 MILLION JEWISH PEOPLE.  
THIS YEAR MARKS THE 65TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LIBERATION OF NAZI 
CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND THE ERADICATION OF NAZI PERSECUTION.

3.  WHILE VISITING THE BUCHENWALD CONCENTRATION CAMP WITH PRESIDENT 
BARACK OBAMA IN JUNE 2009, HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR ELIE WIESEL REFLECTED ON 
THE MOMENT HE BECAME FREE.  "WHEN I WAS LIBERATED IN 1945 BY THE 
AMERICAN ARMY, SOMEHOW MANY OF US WERE CONVINCED THAT AT LEAST ONE 
LESSON WILL HAVE BEEN LEARNED - THAT NEVER AGAIN WILL THERE BE WAR, 
THAT HATRED IS NOT AN OPTION, THAT RACISM IS STUPID... I WAS SO 
HOPEFUL."  REMEMBERING THE HOLOCAUST REMINDS US OF THE NEED FOR 
CONSTANT VIGILANCE IN MAINTAINING DEMOCRATIC IDEALS.  EVERYDAY EACH OF 
US HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SHAPE THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE.  BY KEEPING 
THESE STORIES OF FREEDOM ALIVE AND BY BUILDING ON ELIE WIESEL'S 
ORIGINAL HOPE, EACH OF US MUST WORK TO PROMOTE HUMAN DIGNITY AND 
CONFRONT HATRED WHENEVER IT OCCURS.  TO PRESERVE HUMAN FREEDOM, OUR 
ACTIONS MATTER.

4.  COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO OBSERVE HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY 
THROUGH EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, EXHIBITS, PUBLICATIONS, AND PARTICIPATION 
IN MILITARY AND COMMUNITY EVENTS.
