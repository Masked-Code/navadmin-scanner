RMKS/1.  As outlined in reference (a), we need to get the basics right, but 
it is not the full recipe for success.  To truly excel, we also need to add 
engagement to the mix.  Engagement works both ways, at all levels, Navy to 
Sailor and Sailor to Navy.  An engaged Sailor is one who is fully absorbed by 
and enthusiastic about their work, and as a result takes positive action to 
further the reputation and interests of the organization.  An engaged Sailor 
has a positive attitude towards our Navy and its values.  Engagement is all 
about Sailor experiences and Sailor satisfaction.  Providing this engaged 
environment is a key to success in retaining our very talented Sailors.

2.  We can think about *command engagement of the Sailor* as well as *Sailor 
engagement to the command and the Navy* using a hierarchical pyramid.  First, 
early in the development of a Sailor the Navy provides *basic needs to our 
Sailors* at the foundation.  Next we move upward to our Sailors *contributing 
to the mission* and *fostering teamwork* as they mature into deckplate 
leadership positions in the division and department and then at the unit 
level. At the very top of the development cycle the *personal and 
professional growth* of our Sailors drives engagement and leadership across 
commands at the type commander, Fleet and Navy level.
    a.  Basic Needs as a Sailor.  As our Sailors enter our Navy and 
ultimately report to their first operational assignment, they first and 
foremost just want to contribute to the team, know they are a valued member 
and that they are going to be able to do their best, day in a day out, 
reliably.  They are eager to prove themselves.  It is our job as leaders to 
enable that energy, enthusiasm and motivation, and let them run with it.  But 
first they have basic needs that must be met in order to do their jobs and we 
should ensure they are met.  These include very basic things like food, a 
place to sleep, a home for their family, the safety, security, and pay for 
their family, etc.  Next, providing tools, materials, equipment and resources 
to accomplish the mission, clear expectations from supervisors and effective 
communication up and down the chain of command.  Leaders need to foster 
quality working relationships with peers, superiors and subordinates that 
meet these basic needs.  These basic needs form the base of the pyramid.  If 
they are not met, performance will be impacted eventually, no matter how 
senior the Sailor may be.
    b.  Contribution by Our Sailors to Their Small Team.  With the basic 
needs met, our Sailors can now blossom - watch qualification, maintenance 
qualifications, proving themselves within the work center, the division, 
whatever small team they currently identify with, as a proven performer  
someone capable of carrying their share of the *load* at the division and 
department levels.  As we focus on maturing our Sailors as leaders, they grow 
and should be next asking, *What do I give? How do I contribute?* Mission 
success is dependent on the sum of individual contributions linked for a 
common purpose.  Leaders should be encouraging the development of our 
Sailors.  Leaders should be valuing their work and it needs to show publicly 
and personally, on a regular basis.  Our Sailors should want to contribute to 
their team to give back to Navy - because that contribution matters and is 
recognized.
    c.  Teamwork at the Command Level.  As Sailors continue to mature, the 
next phase is to nurture involvement and leadership among teams of teams.  We 
should set the conditions that foster a workplace environment that supports 
individual opinions (*the Captain listened to my idea and acted on it*), 
encourages collegiality, and champions a commitment to excellence for the 
entire command.  Our Sailors push their teammates to high standards, higher 
levels of performance, and then excellence.
    d.  Growth at the Fleet and Navy Level.  The final question to ask is 
*how do we grow?* It is *we,* not *I.* Sailors need to know there are 
continuing opportunities to learn and grow within the Navy, and by extension, 
improve the Navy team.  They should be encouraged to be constantly thinking 
in terms of the bigger Navy team and not just within their *tribe* or within 
their lifelines. Learning and professional growth are not only available, 
they are expected of senior leaders.

3.  By being Brilliant on the Basics and incorporating all of the elements of 
engagement we will create an environment for our Sailors to feel truly vested 
in their Navy and committed to their shipmates. Our goals are to grow a Navy 
that values and encourages individual needs, and the critical role each 
Sailor plays in supporting the success of our Navy, and to grow a Navy where 
the Sailors value it and the opportunities it offers.  The competition for 
their talent is urgent, and we need to act now.
