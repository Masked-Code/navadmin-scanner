RMKS/1.  This naval message provides information and updates on the Navys 
participation in the Defense Attache Service (DAS) for Navy personnel. 
 
2.  The Navy looks to its most qualified and capable officers and enlisted 
personnel to fill demanding and rewarding positions as Senior Defense 
Officials/Defense Attaches, Naval Attaches, Assistant Naval Attaches, 
Operations Coordinators and Operations Assistants in exotic and unique 
locations.  They will serve as a part of the U.S. Defense Attache Office 
team, based at U.S. Embassies in 78 countries.  All candidates are trained at 
the Defense Intelligence Agency’s (DIA) 13-week Joint Military Attache 
School, and depending on their assigned country, extensive language training 
may be provided prior to arriving on station.  Naval Attaches are the voice 
of the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) and Chief of Naval Operations, 
articulating policies as well as Navy strategy to a host nation.  Naval 
Attaches observe and report information to reduce strategic surprise, and 
call attention to issues that will affect U.S. interests in time for decision 
makers to act. Naval Attaches have provided observations that have been 
briefed at the highest levels of government.  Our Naval Attaches build 
strong, lasting relationships with partners who share a common vision of 
maritime security.  As part of the U.S. Embassy country team and in support 
of the Ambassadors objectives, Naval Attaches play a critical role in 
enhancing relationships in host nations which are not traditional or long-
time partners. 
 
3.  SECNAV considers the Navy’s contribution to the DAS as one of his most 
critical responsibilities, as expanded upon in references (a) and (b).  For 
Naval Attaches, SECNAV is the final approval authority for officers nominated 
to serve in the DAS under DIA.  The Director of Naval Intelligence manages 
the day-to-day operation of the Navy Attache Program as detailed in reference 
(c). 
 
4.  For those who meet the selection criteria of reference (d), service in 
the DAS offers unique opportunities for the best and most highly qualified 
Navy personnel.  Through a robust, competitive selection and training 
process, service members and their families will ultimately be posted at U.S. 
Embassies around the world in one of more than 150 DAS positions. 
    a.  Over the next year, Navy Attache Affairs will screen for attache 
    positions in:  Albania, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burma, 
    Cameroon, Chile, China, Djibouti, Ecuador, Egypt, Fiji, France, Germany, 
    Greece, Honduras, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kenya, 
Madagascar, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Philippines, 
Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Tunisia, United Arab 
Emirates, Ukraine, and United Kingdom. 
    b.  In addition, exceptional Limited Duty Officer/Chief Warrant Officer 
and enlisted personnel will be able to screen as Operations Coordinators 
(OPSCO) and Operations Assistants (OPSAsst) positions in:  Australia, China, 
Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Malaysia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, United 
Kingdom, Uruguay, and Vietnam. 
 
5.  To demonstrate the importance SECNAV places on duty at DAOs, as discussed 
in reference (a), procedures are in place at Navy Personnel Command (NPC) to 
expand the eligibility for DAS assignments.  Active promotion and advertising 
of the program has been implemented and NPC is working to further incentivize 
and reward DAS service through statutory promotion board 
precepts.  Additionally, these tours frequently offer language training, 
Foreign Language Proficiency Pay, and Special Duty Assignment Pay for 
enlisted personnel.
