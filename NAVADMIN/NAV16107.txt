into the security officer limited duty officer (LDO) designator 649X.  This 
message only applies to active-duty Security Technician CWOs.

2.  Newly approved Navy Security Force requirements dictate an increase in 
senior LDO leadership.  Merging the CWO billets into the security officer LDO 
designator and suspending CWO accessions will ensure the increased demand for 
senior security officers is met.

3.  Current Security Technician CWO5s, CWO4s, and those CWO3s who have failed 
to select (once or twice) to CWO4 (designator 749X) will not be eligible for 
re-designation to LDO.

4.  Current Security Technician CWO2s and CWO3s who have no failure of 
selection for the next higher pay-grade respectively have two options for 
transition.
    a.  Conversion to LDO.  CWOs should submit requests for re- designation 
to Security LDO designator 649X via the LDO and CWO community manager (OCM) 
using format per reference (a).  Grade determinations for CWOs selected under 
this option will be based on years of commissioned service as follows:
        (1) Less Than Two Years:  Appointment to lieutenant junior grade 
(LTJG) upon second commissioning anniversary.
        (2) More Than Two Years but Less Than Four
Years:  Appointment to lieutenant (LT) upon fourth commissioning anniversary.
        (3) Four or More Years:  Appointment to LT in the fiscal year that 
appointment occurs.  Specific date of rank will be determined by the 
Director, Military Community Management (BUPERS-3)/Career Progression 
Division (PERS-8) in order to maintain relative seniority of those officers 
requesting appointment as a 649X LT.
    b.  Elect to Retain CWO Status.  CWOs desiring this option must notify 
the LDO and CWO OCMs via digitally signed encrypted e-mail at

respectively.  CWOs electing to retain CWO status will compete for promotion 
and be subject to the provisions of reference (b).

5.  Officers eligible to apply for transition or those desiring to declare 
permanent warrant officer status must notify the LDO and CWO OCMs listed in 
paragraph 4b no later than 60 days following the release of this NAVADMIN.  
Officers who take no action by this date will be considered as having opted 
for permanent CWO status and will be subject to the provisions of reference 
(b).

6.  Billet transitions will take place in two phases to maximize community 
health relative to year group and provide CWOs viable promotion opportunity.
    a.  Phase I will begin 90 days following the release of this NAVADMIN 
with the Security Technician CWO2/CWO3 billets (designator
749X) being converted to LDO (designator 649X) LT and below.
    b.  Phase II will occur at a later date based on CWO inventory and 
promotion opportunity.  CWO4/CWO5 billets will be converted in phases to LDO 
(designator 6490) to maintain a viable career path for CWOs who choose not to 
convert.
