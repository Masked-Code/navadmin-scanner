RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces convening of the November 2015 Active-Duty 
Officer Lateral Transfer/Redesignation Board.  The lateral transfer and 
redesignation process is a key tool by which Navy manages the talents of its 
officers.  It provides flexibility in officer community manning and improves 
the Navys return on investment in officer training and education by 
maximizing and utilizing the talents and specialized skillsets of officers 
throughout their careers.  As part of the process, applications from 
qualified unrestricted line, restricted line, staff corps, and limited duty 
officers (LDO) are now being accepted for an Active-Duty Officer Lateral 
Transfer/Redesignation Board which convenes 16 November 2015.  Full-Time 
Support and Selected Reserve officers are not eligible to apply for this 
board.

2.  In addition to the year group (YG) limitations imposed in paragraph 6, 
applicants must also meet eligibility requirements detailed in references(a) 
through (c).
    a.  Members who do not meet eligibility requirements per references (a) 
through (c), such as time-in-grade, years of commissioned service (YCS), or 
time in service must submit a waiver package in addition to their lateral 
transfer/redesignation application.
    b.  Waiver packages must include member's waiver request and commanding 
officer's endorsement.  This endorsement is separate from any endorsements 
contained in the member's lateral transfer/redesignation application and must 
specifically address the eligibility requirement for a waiver.

3.  Submit applications and waiver packages using the format in reference (b) 
to the address below:

7.  Notes
    a.  Must have surface warfare officer (SWO) qualification completed to 
apply for transfer.  Officers under SWO continuation pay or revised junior 
critical skills retention bonus (CSRB) contract are not eligible for transfer 
until completion of bonus obligation.  SWOs serving under an agreement for 
any of the SWO bonuses are eligible to apply to the board if the board 
convening date is within one year of satisfaction of the full bonus 
obligation.
    b.  Waivers to the requirements of paragraph 4h of reference (b) for 
nuclear-trained surface and submarine warfare officers may be considered on a 
case-by-case basis.
    c.  Officers screened "not cleared" for their next career milestone are 
eligible.
    d.  The YG range provided displays possible opportunities. Contact your 
specific community placement officer with questions regarding quota 
availability for each platform/community/year group. General aviation 
officers (1300) are eligible to apply for lateral transfer regardless of 
active-duty service obligation (ADSO) from winging.  Aviation officers (131X 
and 132X) are eligible to apply for lateral transfer if the officer has 
fulfilled ADSO, or will be within 12 months of completing ADSO at the time 
the board convenes. Aviation officers with obligated service as a result of 
Aviation Career Continuation Pay (ACCP) are eligible to apply if the officer 
will be within 12 months of completing ACCP obligation at the time the board 
convenes.  Additionally, aviation officers with obligated service as a result 
of ACCP are eligible to apply if the officer will be within 12 months of 
department head tour projected rotation date (PRD) at the time the board 
convenes, regardless of contrary ACCP contract language.  Redesignation 
immediately following department head tour may result in cancellation of 
ACCP, which will be adjudicated by Aviation Officer Assignment (PERS-43).  
Aviation officers shall not be permitted to redesignate until completion of 
ADSO, fulfillment/expiration/cancellation of ACCP contract, or PRD, as 
determined by Aviation Officer Community Manager (BUPERS-313). Aviation 
officers in operational flying billets (billet designator XXX1 or XXX2) will 
not be permitted to redesignate until PRD. BUPERS-313 authorizes 
redesignation timing and PERS-43 is the final approval authority on the above 
eligibility constraints.
    e.  LDO redesignation requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, 
considering impact to overall community health.  Nuclear LDO submissions will 
not be considered.  All other designators must have completed four years 
commissioned service and accepted permanent LDO appointment to LT prior to 
lateral transfer/redesignation.  LDO out quotas are extremely limited, 
special consideration will be given to officers projected to be statutorily 
separated for years of service prior to attaining the rank of Commander.  
Supply Corps and Information Dominance Corps applicants in YGs 09 and senior 
will receive favorable consideration.
    f.  Officers in YG-13 and senior seeking lateral transfer into the 
surface warfare community are strongly encouraged to contact the SWO 
community manager prior to applying in order to discuss critical SWO career 
milestone requirements.
    g.  Only Restricted Line and Staff Corps selections to the Naval Special 
Warfare (NSW) community will be processed via this board. Unrestricted Line

must be eligible for top secret/sensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI) 
security clearance, world-wide assignable, meet requirements of reference (d) 
and pass a physical screening test per reference (e).

Warfare (IW) or Intelligence communities:  O4 applicants for 1820 with more 
than two years time-in-grade should contact the IP community manager to 
discuss milestone and performance requirements.  All officers who are either

considered for lateral transfer.  IP, IW, and Intel applicants must be 
eligible for TS/SCI, submit a Personnel Security Questionnaire (SF-86) per 
reference (f), or include a letter from a special security officer (SSO) 
indicating successful completion of an SCI pre-screening interview.  IW 
applicants that do not hold or are not currently eligible for TS/SCI must 
complete an SCI eligibility pre-screening interview with the Fleet Cyber 
Command Security Directorate field office at (850) 452-6868 and submit the 
results as part of their application.  All applicants must be world-wide 
assignable and fit for full sea duty.  All YG-11 and senior 6450
