SUBJ/50TH ANNIVERSARY OF OMBUDSMAN APPRECIATION DAY//

REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/02SEP2014//
AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1750.1G, NAVY FAMILY OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM.//

RMKS/1.  September 14 is a day for the Navy to show its appreciation to 
command Ombudsman for their volunteerism and dedication to supporting our 
Navy and its families.  This year is especially meaningful as we celebrate 
the 50th anniversary of the Ombudsman Program.  Please take a moment to 
recognize your command Ombudsman and the many benefits of the Ombudsman 
Program.  This practice goes back to the inception of the Ombudsman Program 
in 1970, when ADM Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr., introduced the Navy Family Command 
Ombudsman Program via Z-Gram 24.

2.  Navy team, these selfless volunteers are crucial to the success of our 
Navy.  The contributions Ombudsman make to the success of the command's 
mission are immeasurable.  Their support to Navy families enable Sailors and 
commands to focus on mission requirements while knowing that their families 
have a trained and reliable resource to provide support on the home front.

3.  Commanders and command triads, you play a critical role in ensuring your 
Ombudsman are properly prepared and always feel there is a direct line of 
communication with you to assist your Sailors.

4.  Ombudsman Coordinators, you serve as an invaluable resource to Ombudsman 
and Commanders.  Your guidance and understanding of the Ombudsman Program 
provide a firm foundation to all who are affiliated with the program.

5.  Ombudsman, congratulations on 50 impressive years of dedicated service 
and support!  Thank you for all you do and BRAVO ZULU!

6.  Released by Admiral Mike Gilday, Chief of Naval Operations.//
