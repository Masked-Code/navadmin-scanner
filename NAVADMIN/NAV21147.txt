RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the fiscal year (FY) 2021 Full-Time 
Support (FTS) Aviation Department Head Retention Bonus (ADHRB) program in 
line with reference (a).  A vital part of developing a total force strategy 
and maintaining combat readiness is to provide appropriate incentives to 
retain skilled personnel for critical naval aviation enterprise billets.  The 
FTS ADHRB program provides selected bonuses as an incentive to eligible 
pilots and naval flight officers serving in department head (DH) billets 
during FY-21 and to retain those officers through a post-DH aviation staff 
tour. 
 
2.  The FTS ADHRB program continues the bonus system of previous years that 
is tied directly to force structure and targets initial eligible 
aviators.  Annual DH rates of up to $35,000 are listed below and vary by 
community.  DH retention bonuses will be paid in three or five equal annual 
installments.  If a signed contract is received before completing 12 months 
of their initial DH tour, the Service Member is eligible for the 5-year 
contract beginning on his/her one-year anniversary in the DH 
squadron.  Service Members may sign up for the one-year contract at any time 
during their initial DH tour, but will not be approved until after his/her 
one-year anniversary in the DH squadron.  The following are the rates 
for squadron DH contracts:
 
HM - Pilot               $15,000/YR 
HSC - Pilot              $15,000/YR 
HSM - Pilot              $25,000/YR 
HT - Pilot               $15,000/YR 
VAQ - Pilot/NFO          $15,000/YR 
VFA/C - Pilot/NFO        $35,000/YR
