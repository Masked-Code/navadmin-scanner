SUBJ/FLEET OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE DISPOSAL AND NAVY DIVER 
PROGRAM// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES FLEET OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE EXPLOSIVE 
ORDNANCE DISPOSAL AND NAVY DIVER PROGRAM.  THE EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE 
DISPOSAL (EOD) AND NAVY DIVER (ND) RATINGS COMPRISE THE NAVAL SPECIAL 
OPERATIONS (NSO) COMMUNITY.  
NSO HAS BEEN, AND CONTINUES TO BE, CRITICAL IN THE SUCCESS OF OVERSEAS 
CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS.  CURRENTLY, ZONE A MANNING FOR EOD IS AT 61 
PERCENT AND NAVY DIVER IS 82 PERCENT.  THIS REPRESENTS A CRITICAL 
SHORTFALL IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN CURRENT AND 
FUTURE OPERATIONS.
2.  THE NAVY SEEKS SMART, FIT, HARDWORKING INDIVIDUALS FROM ALL 
BACKGROUNDS TO JOIN THE RANKS OF THE NSO COMMUNITY.  THE EOD AND ND 
RATES OFFER CAREERS WITH UNMATCHED CHALLENGES AND JOB SATISFACTION TO 
MOTIVATED CANDIDATES.  HISTORIC ADVANCEMENT, SRB LEVELS AND BONUS PAYS 
FOR THE PROGRAM HAVE BEEN WELL ABOVE NAVY AVERAGE.  QUALIFIED E-5 AND 
BELOW APPLICANTS WITH LESS THAN SIX 
YEARS OF SERVICE ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY.   
3.  TO ADVERTISE THE NEED FOR SAILORS IN THESE COMMUNITIES, REQUEST THE 
WIDEST DISSEMINATION OF THIS FLEET ACCESSION OPPORTUNITY THROUGHOUT THE 
ENTIRE CAREER DEVELOPMENT TEAM.  
PRO-ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT OF COMMAND LEADERSHIP IN FINDING THE RIGHT 
SAILORS TO SERVE IN THESE CRITICAL POSITIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO MEET THE 
GROWING DEMAND.
4.  EACH COMMAND SHOULD MAKE THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND ENGAGE 
SAILORS WHO ARE QUALIFIED AND INTERESTED IN PURSUING A CAREER IN THESE 
COMMUNITIES.  COMMANDS SHOULD WORK WITH RATING DETAILERS TO ENSURE THAT 
APPLICANTS CAN BE RELEASED WHEN QUALIFIED.
5.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE EXCITING COMMUNITIES VISIT 
WWW.EOD.NAVY.MIL FOR THE EOD RATING AND WWW.NECC.NAVY.MIL/DIVER
