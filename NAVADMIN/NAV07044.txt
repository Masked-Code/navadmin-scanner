RMKS/1. MILITARY SAVES WEEK, ESTABLISHED AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE DOD 
PERSONAL FINANCIAL READINESS CAMPAIGN, PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
COMMANDERS TO ENCOURAGE SAILORS AND FAMILY MEMBERS TO ESTABLISH 
PERSONAL SAVINGS GOALS AND HABITS TO MEET UNFORESEEN EMERGENCIES.
THIS SOCIAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN IS DESIGNED TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR, BY 
EDUCATING OUR PERSONNEL ON HOW TO BUILD WEALTH, NOT DEBT.
2. THE WEEK OF 25FEB-4MAR 2007 HAS BEEN SET ASIDE TO ENCOURAGE, 
MOTIVATE, AND EDUCATE SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO INCREASE PERSONAL 
SAVINGS, DECREASE DEBT, AND DEVELOP FINANCIAL FITNESS HABITS THAT LEAD 
TO IMPROVED FINANCIAL STABILITY AND OVERALL UNIT MISSION READINESS.
3. THE MILITARY SAVES CAMPAIGN, DEVELOPED THROUGH A COOPERATIVE 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN DOD AND THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA (CFA), 
ENCOURAGES LEADERSHIP TO PROMOTE WEALTH BUILDING MESSAGES AND CONDUCT 
UNIT LEVEL CAMPAIGNS AND EVENTS FOR MILITARY MEMBERS TO SET SAVINGS 
GOALS, OPEN SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, MAKE REGULAR CONTRIBUTIONS TO HOUSEHOLD 
SAVINGS, INCREASE DEBT PAYMENTS, AND PARTICIPATE IN FINANCIAL EDUCATION 
PROGRAMS.
4. THE MILITARY SAVES CAMPAIGN IS A COMMAND INITIATIVE, SIMILAR TO THE 
COMBINED FEDERAL CAMPAIGN, IN WHICH LEADERSHIP CAN WORK TO CREATE A 
CULTURE THAT ENCOURAGES SAVINGS AND FINANCIAL READINESS.
THE COMMAND FINANCIAL SPECIALIST (CFS) SHOULD BE INVOLVED, ALONG WITH 
OTHER KEY COMMAND LEADERS, IN COORDINATING EVENTS, WORKSHOPS AND OTHER 
CREATIVE ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE INCREASED PERSONAL SAVING 
BEHAVIOR.
5. COMMANDS SHOULD FULLY UTILIZE LOCAL RESOURCES (PUBLIC AFFAIRS, FLEET 
AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS, INSTALLATION BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS, 
COMMUNITY SUPPORT CENTERS, SENIOR ENLISTED ADVISORS, SPOUSE CLUBS AND 
ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE NAVY MARINE CORPS RELIEF SOCIETY) IN EVENT 
PLANNING. TO ASSIST IN MAKING MILITARY SAVES WEEK A SUCCESS AT YOUR 
COMMAND, RESOURCE INFORMATION AND TOOL KITS ARE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD 
AT HTTP:/WWW.MILITARYSAVES.ORG.
6. FINANCIAL READINESS STARTS WITH MAKING A COMMITMENT, SETTING A 
FINANCIAL GOAL AND WORKING TOWARD ACHIEVING THAT GOAL. SAILORS AND 
FAMILY MEMBERS CAN BECOME MILITARY SAVERS BY MAKING A PERSONAL 
COMMITMENT, DEVELOPING A SAVINGS PLAN, AND UTILIZING FINANCIAL 
EDUCATION SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS. 
COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO PROMOTE MAXIMUM UTILIZATION OF MILITARY 
SAVES EVENTS.
