SUBJ/NOTICE OF CONVENING FY-23-1 TEST PILOT SCHOOL SELECTION BOARD// 
 
REF/A/DOC/BUPERS/06JAN21// 
NARR/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1500.62E, TEST PILOT SCHOOLS// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces convening of the U.S. Naval Test 
Pilot School (USNTPS) Selection Board on 15 December 2021.  This 
board will select highly qualified naval aviators and naval flight 
officers (NFO) for USNTPS.  Test Pilot School (TPS) graduates have 
significant and long-lasting influence on platforms and systems that 
directly impact the future warfighting capability of the Fleet. 
Request command and Fleet community assistance to identify 
candidates with strong operational performance and, ideally, strong 
academic backgrounds in science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics fields of study. 
 
2.  To be eligible for board consideration, a command-endorsed 
application in line with reference (a), must be received by MyNavy 
Career Center (MNCC) no later than 1 November 2021.  Additional 
documentation (e.g., Type Wing/Air Wing endorsements, letters of 
recommendation, FITREPs, etc.) will be accepted until 1 December 
2021, but must be submitted by the applicant as a letter to the 
board, in line with subparagraph 4a below.  The e-mail address(es), 
phone number(s), college transcripts and post-TPS test squadron 
assignment preferences of the applicant must be included with the 
application.  Current contact information (ashore/afloat) of the 
commanding officer must be included to expedite notification, if 
selected. 
 
3.  The command endorsement shall explicitly state whether the 
applicant, if selected, will be allowed and available to report for 
pre-arrival training by the following dates: 
    a.  18 April 2022 for Fixed Wing pilots. 
    b.  25 April 2022 for Rotary Wing pilots. 
    c.  23 May 2022 for NFOs. 
Endorsements with availability dates after these respective dates 
may be removed from consideration and not reviewed by the board. 
Inability for the applicant to meet the above date may be mitigated 
by conducting initial training in a temporary additional duty 
(TEMADD) status at the expense of the endorsing command.  If this is 
required, it must be explicitly stated in the command endorsement 
that the endorsing command will provide TEMADD funds until the 
applicant can officially detach. 
 
4.  Application package submissions 
    a.  The preferred method of application submission is via 
encrypted email.  E-mail encrypted PDF submissions to

6.  Eligibility 
    a.  Designated naval aviators and NFOs through the grade of 
lieutenant commander, who are qualified for flight duties and have 
not been terminated from flying status, are eligible for selection. 
    b.  The preferred unrestricted line (13X0) aviators are junior 
officers (O-2 or O-3) with detailer-forecasted career timing to 
complete the selected TPS program and a 36-month follow-on test tour 
prior to their expected department head tour.  If there are not 
enough qualified junior officers to meet requirements, lieutenant 
commanders with exceptional records may be selected, provided they 
can meet follow-on test tour requirements and applicable career 
milestones. 
    c.  Aerospace engineering duty officers (1510) through the grade 
of lieutenant commander may be selected if they are able to serve a 
36-month follow-on test tour and still meet career milestones. 
    d.  Applicants determined to have insufficient career timing to 
meet a minimum test tour of 24 months may have their application 
removed from consideration. 
7.  Applicants should periodically check for updates and additional 
information via MyNavy HR at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
