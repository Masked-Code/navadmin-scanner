SUBJ/REALIGNMENT OF THE OPNAV STAFF//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  I DIRECTED A REVIEW OF THE ALIGNMENT AND
PROCESSES USED BY THE OPNAV STAFF IN SUPPORT OF OUR ORGANIZATIONAL
MISSION IN JULY 2005.  DURING THIS REVIEW, IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE
OPNAV STAFF NEEDED TO REALIGN INTERNALLY FOR EFFICIENCY AND
EXTERNALLY TO BETTER SUPPORT THE FLEET.  THE FUTURE I FORESEE WILL
REQUIRE OPTIMUM ALIGNMENT TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF AN EVER CHANGING
AND COMPLEX THREAT IN A FISCALLY CONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENT.  SUCCESS
WILL REQUIRE AGILITY, INTEGRATION OF PROGRAMS AND PROCESSES,
STABILIZATION OF THE INDUSTRIAL BASE, AND CONTROLLING COST.
2.  TO ACHIEVE THESE EFFECTS, WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE SECRETARY
OF THE NAVY, I AM ESTABLISHING A 3-STAR DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL
OPERATIONS FOR COMMUNICATION NETWORKS (N6) AND CONSOLIDATING THE
DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS FOR WARFARE REQUIREMENTS AND
PROGRAMS (N7) WITH THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS FOR
RESOURCES, REQUIREMENTS, AND PROGRAMS (N8) INTO THE POSITION OF
DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS FOR INTEGRATION OF CAPABILITIES AND
RESOURCES (N8).
A.  THE NEW N8 WILL BE CHARGED WITH OPTIMIZING NAVY INVESTMENTS
THROUGH CENTRALIZED COORDINATION OF NAVY WARFIGHTING AND WARFIGHTING
SUPPORT ANALYSIS/ASSESSMENTS, NAVY CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT AND
INTEGRATION, JOINT AND NAVY REQUIREMENTS DEVELOPMENT, AND RESOURCE
PROGRAMMING.  NAVY WARFARE DIRECTORS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN THE
NEW N8, BUT HAVE RETAINED THEIR CURRENT ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.
N8 WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING DIVISIONS:  PROGRAMMING (N80),
ASSESSMENTS (N81), FISCAL MANAGEMENT (N82), AND WARFARE INTEGRATION
(N8F).  THE WARFARE DIRECTORS WILL BE SUBORDINATE TO N8F: C4ISR
(N83), NAVIGATOR/OCEANOGRAPHER OF THE NAVY (N84), EXPEDITIONARY
WARFARE (N85), SURFACE WARFARE (N86), SUBMARINE WARFARE (N87), AIR
WARFARE (N88), AND SPECIAL PROGRAMS (N89).
B.  THE NEW N6 WILL BE CHARGED WITH OPTIMIZING NAVY NETWORK
INVESTMENTS THROUGH CENTRALIZED COORDINATION OF NAVY WARFIGHTING AND
WARFIGHTING SUPPORT ANALYSIS/ASSESSMENTS, NAVY NETWORK CAPABILITY
DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION, JOINT AND NAVY REQUIREMENTS
DEVELOPMENT, AND RESOURCE PROGRAMMING.  THE DESIRED EFFECTS ARE TO
PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE TO
COMBAT-READY NAVY FORCES, IMPROVED BUSINESS PRACTICES, AND BETTER
ALIGNMENT WITH JOINT WARFIGHTING.  THE OBJECTIVE OF THE N6 IS TO
DEVELOP NETWORKS THAT ENABLE OUR SAILORS TO EFFECTIVELY DO THEIR
MISSION.  IN DOING SO, N6 WILL ACT AS PRINCIPAL ADVISOR TO CNO FOR
NETWORK MATTERS; BE MATRIXED WITH N2 FOR BATTLESPACE AWARENESS, N3
FOR INFORMATION OPERATIONS, AND N3 FOR COMMAND AND CONTROL; AND
SERVE AS NAVY S TOP LEVEL ADVOCATE FOR INFORMATION
MANAGEMENT/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE NAVY. N6

INFORMATION OFFICER.  N6 WILL CONSIST OF THE FOLLOWING DIVISIONS:
CAPABILITY ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT DIVISION (N61), WARFARE
