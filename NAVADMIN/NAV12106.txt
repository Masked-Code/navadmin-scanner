SUBJ/ SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH (SAAM)//

RMKS/

1.  APRIL IS NATIONAL SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH (SAAM).
OUR ENTIRE NAVY WILL DEVOTE TIME AND LEADERSHIP TO FOCUS ITS EFFORTS  ON 
AWARENESS AND PREVENTION OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE THROUGH THE USE OF  SPECIAL EVENTS 
AND COMMAND-LEVEL EDUCATION.

2.  WHILE NAVY HAS MADE PROGRESS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, OUR  WORK IS NOT 
DONE.  SEXUAL ASSAULT IS A CRIME THAT ERODES OUR  OPERATIONAL READINESS AND 
REQUIRES LEADERSHIP FROM ALL LEVELS OF THE  CHAIN OF COMMAND.

3.  USING THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MESSAGE OF "HURTS ONE, AFFECTS  ALL. 
PREVENTION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT IS EVERYONE'S DUTY." AS THE  OVERARCHING THEME 
FOR SAAM, FOUR COMPLEMENTARY SUB-THEMES WERE  DEVELOPED, ONE FOR EACH WEEK OF 
NAVY'S EFFORT:
(1) WEEK OF APRIL 02 - "HURTS ONE."
(2) WEEK OF APRIL 09 - "AFFECTS ALL."
(3) WEEK OF APRIL 16 - "PREVENTION IS EVERYONE'S DUTY."
(4) WEEK OF APRIL 23 - "WE WILL NOT TOLERATE SEXUAL ASSAULT."

4.  DURING THE MONTH OF APRIL, UNITS ARE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN  AS MANY 
SAAM EVENTS AS FEASIBLE.  AT A MINIMUM, UNITS MUST CONDUCT A  TOTAL OF TWO 
HOURS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS VIA A STAND DOWN IN  ONE TWO-HOUR BLOCK, OR 
(PREFERABLY) FOUR 30-MINUTE BLOCKS-ONE PER  WEEK TO COINCIDE WITH THE 
ESTABLISHED THEME OF THE WEEK.  TO  FACILITATE DELIVERY OF THE SAAM WEEKLY 
MESSAGES, TRAINING AWARENESS  MATERIALS, INCLUDING GUIDED DISCUSSION SCRIPTS 
AND LEADERSHIP  VIDEOS, ARE LOCATED ON THE NAVY PERSONNEL COMMANDS SEXUAL 
ASSAULT  PREVENTION AND RESPONSE (SAPR) WEBSITE AT:  HTTP://WWW.SAPR.NAVY.MIL

COMPLETION OF TRAINING TO THE CHIEF OF NAVAL  PERSONNEL VIA EMAIL TO THE POC

5.  A COMPILATION OF POTENTIAL SAAM ACTIVITIES IS POSTED TO THE  WEBSITE.  
UNIT LEADERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO EXECUTE ONE OR MORE OF  THESE ACTIVITIES TO 
ENERGIZE SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS WITHIN THEIR  RESPECTIVE COMMANDS.  
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE POSTED ON THE  WEBSITE, INCLUDING POSTERS, PLAN OF 
THE DAY/WEEK NOTES, AND  LEADERSHIP TALKING POINTS.  THE WEBSITE WILL BE 
UPDATED IN THE  COMING WEEKS, SO CHECK FREQUENTLY FOR NEW CONTENT.

6.  WE MUST ALL OPERATIONALIZE SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE  BY 
CREATING AND MAINTAINING A PROFESSIONAL WORK ENVIRONMENT, CARING  FOR OUR 
PEOPLE, DISCOURAGING ALCOHOL ABUSE, AND ENSURING A POSITIVE  LIBERTY 
ENVIRONMENT.  ONLY THROUGH A UNIFIED EFFORT CAN WE ENSURE  THE MESSAGE IS 
HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR: WE WILL NOT TOLERATE SEXUAL  ASSAULT.
