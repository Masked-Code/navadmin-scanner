SUBJ/2014 OMBUDSMAN APPRECIATION DAY//

RMKS/1. 14 September 2014 is a day set aside for Navy personnel and families 
to show appreciation to command ombudsmen for their dedicated service to the 
fleet, fighter, and family. This practice goes back to the inception of the 
program in 1970, when ADM Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr., introduced the Navy Family 
Command Ombudsman Program via Z-Gram 24.

2. The contribution ombudsmen make to the success of the command mission is 
immeasurable. Their efforts in supporting Navy families enable Sailors and 
commands to focus on mission requirements all while knowing families have a 
trained and reliable resource to provide support on the home front.

3. Ombudsmen, your diligence and steadfast commitment is unmatched. On behalf 
of Navy families, thank you for your service!

4. Navy team, please take the opportunity to express well deserved 
appreciation and gratitude to these selfless volunteers who are so important 
to the success of our Navy. Additional information about the Ombudsman 
Program is available at www.ffsp.navy.mil.
