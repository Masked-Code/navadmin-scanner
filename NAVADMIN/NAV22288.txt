RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the High Year Tenure (HYT) Plus pilot 
program which offers a new opportunity for talented and experienced Sailors 
to continue their Navy careers beyond the HYT limits listed in reference (a).  
This pilot also offers additional looks for advancement and more time to 
build retirement benefits, to include E5 retirement.

2.  Active Component (AC) and Training and Administration of the Reserve 
(TAR).
    a.  With the exception of command master chiefs (CMDCM), command senior 
chiefs (CMDCS) and nuclear trained master chiefs, all AC and TAR enlisted 
Sailors of all ranks and rates with a HYT date in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 or 
2024 may chose to remain on active duty beyond their original HYT date by 
applying for a job in MyNavy Assignment and then obligating for a full tour 
when matched to an assignment.  It is also possible to extend at the current 
command to complete an additional full tour there, if a valid billet exists 
and the assignment is approved by the detailer and the command.  Once 
obligated for a follow-on tour, the Sailors HYT date will be matched to the 
end of the new tour.  If you are an E5 Sailor approaching your HYT threshold 
of 16 years, this pilot not only allows you to continue your naval career and 
potentially advance to the next rank, it provides a path for you to become 
eligible for retirement.  In all cases, Sailors must be recommended for 
retention by their commanding officer on their most recent evaluation.
    b.  In order to facilitate this pilot program, all AC and TAR enlisted 
HYT dates occurring between 1 March 2023 and 30 September
2024 are hereby suspended, with the exception of CMDCM, CMDCS and nuclear 
trained master chiefs.  HYT Plus eligible AC and TAR Sailors with a HYT date 
in that time frame will no longer be involuntarily separated or involuntarily 
transferred to the fleet reserve due to reaching HYT as prescribed in 
reference (a).  The decision to remain on active duty beyond the normal end 
of active obligated service
(EAOS) is voluntary and will not require the submission of a HYT waiver 
request.  Sailors who otherwise would have reached HYT between 1 March 2023 
and 30 September 2024, but opt to transfer to the fleet reserve, or separate 
at their EAOS will be deemed a voluntary separation.
    c.  HYT Plus eligible Sailors who are approved for HYT-based separation 
or retirement on or before 28 February 2023 may opt into the HYT Plus pilot 
any time prior to their separation or retirement date.  In all cases, the 
request must be received by MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) prior to the 
separation date.  If satisfied to continue on their current path, separating 
or retiring Sailors may execute HYT-based separation or retirement orders 
effective on or before 28 Feb 2023 as an involuntary separation without any 
additional action required based on this NAVADMIN.  In order to opt into the 
HYT Plus pilot:
        (1) Those with approved Fleet Reserve/Retirement must create and 
route a Fleet Reserve/Retirement cancellation request via Navy Standard 
Integrated Personnel System Retirements and Separations citing this NAVADMIN.
        (2) Those with approved HYT-based separation must submit a special 
request/authorization (NAVPERS 1336/3) to their commanding officer requesting 
to opt into the HYT Plus Pilot program.
        (3) In both cases, it is imperative that Command Pay and Personnel 
Administrators submit the requests to cancel separations/retirements to 
Transaction Service Center (TSC) Norfolk, prior to the separation/retirement 
date.  This will ensure cancellation of the transaction to avoid separating a 
member who wants to stay Navy.

3.  Selected Reserve (SELRES, drill with pay).
    a.  SELRES Sailors are automatically approved to continue service through 
30 September 2024 independent of HYT gates outlined in reference (a) as long 
as they remain in good standing with respect to the requirements outlined in 
references (b) and (c) and are recommended for retention on their most recent 
evaluation.
SELRES Sailors are encouraged to coordinate necessary changes to their 
obligated service or projected rotation date with their Navy Reserve Activity 
Command Career Counselor.  SELRES Sailors will continue to follow normal 
assignment policy in line reference (c).
    b.  Voluntary Training Unit (VTU) Sailors.  E6 and below VTU Sailors who 
are not pending administrative or disciplinary action may affiliate with the 
SELRES in line with reference (d) in a paid status for service through 30 
September 2024 unless restricted by other policies.

4.  Advancement Eligibility.  All Active and Reserve Sailors eligible for HYT 
Plus may participate in Navy-wide advancement exams (NWAE), advancement 
selection boards, and other advancement programs without regard to HYT 
requirements outlined in reference (e).  When completing enlisted advancement 
worksheets, Sailors should provide their educational support officer (ESO) 
with their intent to continue service.  Additionally, ESOs shall order 
substitute exams for the upcoming AC, TAR, and SELRES advancement cycles for 
Sailors who are now eligible under HYT Plus.  NWAE participation will not be 
prohibited solely based on HYT for Sailors eligible for HYT Plus.
Additionally, if Fleet Reserve retirement was preventing a Sailor from being 
eligible for an advancement board, the Sailor should contact the Selection 
Board Eligibility Branch (PERS-802) via e-mail at 
NPC_Enlisted_SELBD_Elig.fct(at)navy.mil or phone at (901) 874-
3217 to confirm renewed eligibility.

5.  All other policies outlined in reference (a) not addressed in this 
announcement remain unchanged.

6.  The MyNavy HR HYT page is located at:

Management/Enlisted-Career-Admin/High-Year-Tenure/.

7.  Point of contact:  MNCC - askmncc(at)navy.mil or 1-833-330-MNCC (6622).

8.   This NAVADMIN will be canceled for record purposes on 30
September 2024.
