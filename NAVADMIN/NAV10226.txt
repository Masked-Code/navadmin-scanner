SUBJ/NAVY WOMEN E-MENTOR PROGRAM OPEN ENROLLMENT//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES A NEW OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD FOR THE NAVY 
WOMEN E-MENTOR LEADERSHIP PROGRAM.  THE NAVY WOMEN E-MENTOR PROGRAM IS A WEB-
BASED MENTORING PROGRAM WHICH SUPPORTS THE PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT OF OFFICER AND ENLISTED NAVY WOMEN.  THE PROGRAM CONNECTS NAVY 
WOMEN FOR ONE-ON-ONE MENTORING RELATIONSHIPS FROM WITHIN A LARGE POOL OF 
DIVERSE PARTICIPANTS.  THE PARTICIPANTS INCLUDE ALL RANKS FROM SEAMAN TO 
ADMIRAL, AND REFLECT A BROAD RANGE OF EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE.

2.  THE NAVY WOMEN E-MENTOR PROGRAM HAS 1200 WOMEN PARTICIPANTS ENROLLED, 
INCLUDING 800 MENTORS FROM ALMOST EVERY DESIGNATOR AND RATING.  THE PROGRAM 
HAS A MORE USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE AND HAS ADDED AN EXCITING NEW FEATURE TO 
THE BASIC ONE-ON-ONE MENTORING OPTION CALLED SITUATIONAL MENTORING.  THIS 
FUNCTION ALLOWS MENTEES WHO HAVE IMMEDIATE SHORT-TERM SITUATION-SPECIFIC NEEDS 
TO SELECT ONE OR MORE MENTORS TO ASSIST THEM WITH THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATION 
OR TO POST THE ISSUE, ALLOWING MENTORS TO VOLUNTEER THEIR SUPPORT.

3.  THE NAVY WOMEN E-MENTOR PROGRAM IS OPEN TO ALL ACTIVE DUTY AND RESERVE 
NAVY WOMEN, TO INCLUDE OFFICERS, OFFICERS-IN-TRAINING, AND ENLISTED MEMBERS.
UNIFORMED NAVY WOMEN OF EVERY RANK AND RATE ARE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN 
THIS PROGRAM.  THE OVERALL TIME COMMITMENT IS MINIMAL:  AN EFFECTIVE ONLINE 
MENTORING RELATIONSHIP CAN BE ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED WITHIN ONE TO TWO 
HOURS PER MONTH.

4.  MENTORS AND MENTEES ARE ENCOURAGED TO ENROLL DURING THE OPEN ENROLLMENT 
PERIOD ENDING 15 AUGUST 2010.  THERE ARE 400 NEW OPEN SLOTS FOR MENTORS AND 
PROTEGEES/MENTEES.  INTERESTED PARTICIPANTS CAN REGISTER AT 
HTTP://WWW.ACADEMYWOMEN.ORG/E-MENTOR/NAVYWOMEN.  WITHIN TWO DAYS OF 
REGISTERING, NEW USERS WILL RECEIVE AN E-MAIL INVITING THEM TO LOG ON TO THE 
E-MENTOR PROGRAM SITE TO CREATE PERSONAL PROFILES, INCLUDING AREAS IN WHICH 
THEY NEED AND/OR ARE WILLING TO OFFER GUIDANCE AND, IF MENTEES, SEARCH FOR AND 
SELECT A MENTOR(S).

5.  THE OFFICE OF WOMEN'S POLICY MONITORS AND ASSESSES THE PROGRAM.
SUCCESS METRICS FOR MENTEES ADDRESS IMPROVEMENTS IN ACCESS TO ROLE MODELS, 
EXPANDED PROFESSIONAL NETWORKS, AND IMPROVED RETENTION INTENTIONS BASED ON 
SURVEY RESULTS.  PARTICIPATING MENTORS ARE SURVEYED TO MEASURE INCREASES IN 
UNDERSTANDING OF JUNIOR SERVICE MEMBERS, AWARENESS OF ISSUES AFFECTING THE 
NEXT GENERATION OF NAVY LEADERSHIP, AND IMPACT ON RETENTION INTENTIONS.
