AMPN/REF A IS NAVADMIN 085/18, PROFESSIONAL MILITARY KNOWLEDGE ELIGIBILITY 
EXAM.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN establishes the business rules for the Professional 
Military Knowledge Eligibility Exam (PMK-EE).  In line with reference (a), 
PMK-EE was created as part of the Sailor 2025 initiative to provide greater 
emphasis on PMK and to separate it from rating knowledge.  This is an initial 
step toward electronic advancement exams and eventually, individually 
tailored rating exams, unique to the Navy enlisted classifications held by a 
Sailor.  PMK- EE will serve as an additional eligibility requirement for 
advancement to paygrades E-4 through E-7.

2.  PMK-EE is currently available via MyNavyPortal or Navy e- Learning 
(instruction in paragraph 4).  We anticipate delivery of a PMK-EE mobile 
application, which will allow Sailors to take the exam on a personal smart 
phone, in July 2019.

3.  Eligibility Requirements
    a.  PMK-EE for E-4 through E-7 is now accessible to all Sailors at Navy 
e-Learning (https://learning.nel.navy.mil).
    b.  Active Component (AC), Full-Time Support (FTS) and Reserve Component 
(RC) Sailors must successfully complete PMK-EE for the desired advancement 
paygrade in order to be eligible to take the Navy Wide Advancement Exam 
(NWAE).  PMK-EE must be completed by the first day of the month in which the 
NWAE is administered.
        (1) AC and FTS Sailors must successfully complete PMK-EE for the 
desired advancement paygrade by 1 September 2019 to be eligible to advance 
for the E-4 through E-6 NWAE (advancement cycle 244) and by 1 January 2020 to 
be eligible to advance for the E-7 NWAE (advancement cycle 246).
        (2) RC Sailors must successfully complete PMK-EE for the desired 
advancement paygrade by 1 February 2020 to be eligible to advance for the E-4 
through E-7 NWAE (advancement cycle 106).
    c.  AC, FTS and RC Sailors must successfully complete PMK-EE for the 
desired advancement paygrade in order to be eligible to be selected for 
Meritorious Advancement Program.  PMK-EE must be completed by 1 September 
2019.
    d.  Sailors who automatically advance to E-4 upon completion of an *A* 
school must successfully complete PMK-EE prior to advancement commencing 30 
days after NAVADMIN announcement of the PMK-EE mobile application or 1 
September 2019, whichever occurs last.
    e.  To count for eligibility, PMK-EE for the next paygrade of a Sailor 
must be completed on or after the Sailor is selected for the preceding 
paygrade (for example, in order to complete the E-6 PMK-EE, the Sailor must 
be selected for the E-5 paygrade).
