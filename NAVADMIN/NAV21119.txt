REF/A/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/231514ZOCT20// NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 
287/20, P4 REGARDING THE COMMAND PAY AND PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATOR (CPPA) 
PROGRAM UPDATES.//  
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces updates to the CPPA program in order to 
further improve Fleet readiness and warfighting effectiveness through more 
timely and accurate pay and personnel transactions.

2.  Since the reorganization of Personnel Support Detachments (PSD) and 
Transaction Service Centers (TSC), CNPC has noticed an unforeseen fracture of 
accountability that has developed between the Fleet and the processors at 
PSDs/TSCs.  As CNPC continues to make iterative changes to processes to serve 
the Fleet better, it must be stressed that improving this situation cannot be 
done from Millington alone.  To ensure that the correct personnel are sent to 
the correct billets at the correct time with the correct pay, Fleet 
involvement and command emphasis on the CPPA program must be promoted.

3.  In reference (a), Chief of Naval Personnel (CNP) discussed an update to 
MILPERSMAN 1000-021, CPPA Program, and future replacements to the Transaction 
Online Processing System (TOPS) and the Navy Pay and Personnel (NP2) system.  
Due to delays concerning system security and budget shortfalls, these updates 
have been pushed to the right.  As such, the update to MILPERSMAN 1000-021 
has also been delayed.

4.  Key areas where CPPAs are critical to the success of providing timely and 
accurate pay and personnel transactions to our Sailors around the Fleet are:  
1) professionalization, 2) adherence to Navy Standard Integrated Personnel 
System (NSIPS) reporting requirements,
3) timely submission of system access requests, and 4) command support and 
engagement.  Continued focus and improvement on these programs, processes and 
policies will ensure that the CPPAs and PSD/TSC processors are able to 
provide world-class support to improve Fleet readiness and warfighting 
effectiveness.
    a.  Professionalize the CPPA workforce.  Reference (a) announced updates 
to the CPPA program, designed to professionalize the CPPA workforce.  Key 
enablers included coding billets with the A16A CPPA Navy enlisted 
classification (NEC) to deliver trained Sailors to commands, providing 
increased systems access via the expanded NSIPS CPPA User role and enabling 
CPPAs to gain Sailors to commands and upload Key Supporting Documents (KSD) 
directly.  As Navy Pay and Personnel Support Center (NPPSC) continues to 
refine how to solve pay issues and report metrics, it is imperative that 
trained, decentralized CPPAs push accurate information delivered from 
Sailors.  Commands ensuring this first step and NPPSC providing timely 
feedback will reduce pay issues.
    b.  NSIPS Reporting Requirements:
        (1) In line with reference (a), CPPAs were directed to submit 
completed NSIPS Panel 1 gains by the end of the first business day after a 
Sailor reports for duty.  Since 1 December 2020, pay and personnel metrics 
indicate CPPAs have steadily increased their use of NSIPS Panel 1 reporting 
but are not in full compliance.  The March 2021 metrics revealed that only a 
third of all gains use NSIPS Panel 1 and the remaining two thirds of gains 
were performed by the supporting PSD/TSC, based on receiving KSDs via TOPS.  
The latency associated with using TOPS and a transaction initiated by a 
PSD/TSC clerk adds unnecessary delays in personnel reporting and updating 
unit readiness.  This lack of compliance leads to inaccurate reporting of 
Fleet manning.
        (2) CPPA use of NSIPS Panel 1 reporting to gain Sailors is now 
mandatory.  Starting 1 June 2021, NPPSC will provide monthly metrics data to 
the Fleet and Type Commanders of all units consistently out of compliance, 
focusing on those unexcused, expired gains beyond 10 business days.
    c.  System Access Requests.  Unit readiness has a direct correlation to 
CPPAs providing accurate and timely NSIPS activity reporting.  All PSD/TSC-
supported commands were directed by reference (a) to ensure a minimum of two 
CPPAs had access to and actively used the NSIPS CPPA User role by 1 December 
2020.  CPPA access to NSIPS via system access request is now mandatory.
    d.  Command Support.  The following is a review of the actions that must 
be taken by Commands and their CPPAs:
        (1) Commands must verify they have the appropriate A16A Billets 
Authorized and Sailors have attended CPPA C-School.
Distribution will assign the CPPA C-School en route if the billet is coded 
with the A16A NEC.  If not, there is no demand signal from the Fleet that the 
requirement exists.  If there is insufficient billeted CPPA support at the 
command, COs must take the appropriate action through their respective 
ISICs/TYCOMs to assign the CPPA NEC to those PS and/or YN billets.  CPPA is 
not an appropriate collateral duty outside these administrative ratings, and 
the legacy CPPA training course will retire by the end of FY-21.
        (2) When gaining new Sailors, CPPAs submit completed NSIPS Panel 1 
events by the end of the first business day after a Sailor reports for duty, 
and have the KSDs submitted to the supporting PSD/TSC by the end of the 
second business day.  A review of expired gains should be completed monthly.
        (3) All PSD/TSC-supported commands must ensure a minimum of two CPPAs 
have access to and actively use the NSIPS CPPA User role.
Commands must provide the names of their CPPAs to their supporting PSD/TSC 
and keep information current as CPPAs transfer in and out of their commands.
        (4) Within 36 months of assignment, CPPAs must complete the 24 
required eLearning courses along with related personnel qualification 
standards line items.
    e.  CNPC Support.  In March, CNPC held the first CPPA town hall event 
that highlighted some of these important collaborations.
Additionally, CNPC will provide monthly feedback to leadership with the 
status of CPPA-to-processor partnership.

5.  TOPS Replacement Update
    a.  The transition from TOPS to the MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) Customer 
Relationship Management (CRM) tool has been delayed.
Cutover from TOPS to MNCC CRM is driven by the customer base requesting and 
obtaining accounts and may vary across the PSDs/TSCs.
The transition will re-commence in June 2021.
    b.  To gain access to the MNCC CRM, users must submit a complete and 
timely System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) request using the 
Account Request/SAAR-N step-by-step guide, which may be requested by 
contacting MNCC at 833-330-MNCC (6622) or via e-mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil.  
Users should expect account creation within 10 business days of submitting 
their request to the centralized mailbox ecmr_perspay.fct(at)navy.mil.  New 
account holders will receive an e-mail once the MNCC CRM account has been 
created.  If corrections are required, an e-mail identifying areas for 
correction will be sent to the user.  If, after 14 business days of 
submitting a SAAR-N you have not received an e-mail that your account has 
been created or that corrections are required, send a status request inquiry 
to the MNCC e-mail account.  For proper routing, the subject line should be 
*SAAR-N STATUS REQUEST ICO Your Name, UIC Number*
    c.  Users must login at least every 30 days to prevent account lock out.
    d.  PSDs/TSCs and NPPSC will provide additional MNCC CRM training upon 
request.

6.  NPC, MNCC, and NPPSC staffs continue to seek improvements to personnel 
and pay service delivery across the global network, a key component of which 
is CPPA performance.  The success of the enterprise requires collaboration, 
communication and feedback, as well as command triad leadership support and 
engagement.  Similarly, it is imperative that Sailors review their personnel 
data early and often and report issues to their CPPA, MNCC, or the Navy 
Reserve Activity/Navy Operational Support Center.  Sailors are encouraged to 
contact MNCC for any issues or to provide feedback.  For CPPAs only, MNCC 
call center option 2 is the CPPA Pro-to-Pro Cell and provides a direct line 
for subject matter expert assistance.

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or cancelled, 
whichever occurs first.
