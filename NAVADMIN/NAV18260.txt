promoting are mentally, physically, morally and professionally qualified in 
accordance with section 624 of title 10, U.S. Code.  Per reference (a), 
officers are ineligible for promotion if they have failed the most recent

title 10, U.S. Code as reference (b) for permanent lieutenants and above.  
Use section 578 of title 10, U.S. Code as reference (b) for chief warrant 
officers.  Use sections 624 and 5589 of title 10, U.S. Code as reference (b) 
for limited duty officer promotion to lieutenant.  For limited duty officers,

limited duty officer.  Mail the completed form to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806).

6.  Officers should review reference (b) for minimum time-in-grade 
requirements for purposes of voluntary retirement.  Full time support
