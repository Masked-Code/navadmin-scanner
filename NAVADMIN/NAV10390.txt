SUBJ/HOLIDAY MESSAGE 2010// 

RMKS/1.  I EXTEND MY WARMEST WISHES TO ALL SAILORS, NAVY CIVILIANS, AND THEIR 
FAMILIES FOR A JOYOUS HOLIDAY SEASON.

2.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEDICATED SERVICE AND THE GREAT WORK YOU CONTINUE TO 
DO.  BECAUSE OF YOU, OUR NATION CAN CELEBRATE THIS HOLIDAY SEASON KNOWING THE 
WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL NAVY IS ON WATCH AROUND THE WORLD.

3.  FOR THOSE DEPLOYED, YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES ARE IN OUR THOUGHTS, AND WE ARE 
GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

4.  FOR THOSE AT HOME, NOW IS THE TIME TO CELEBRATE WITH FAMILIES, FRIENDS, 
AND LOVED ONES.  WE WORK HARD THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AND THIS HOLIDAY SEASON IS 
A TIME FOR RELAXATION, REFLECTION, AND REMEMBRANCE OF THOSE WHO HAVE GONE 
BEFORE.

5.  CELEBRATE RESPONSIBLY AND KEEP SAFETY AT THE FOREFRONT OF ALL YOUR HOLIDAY 
ACTIVITIES.  GETTING WHERE YOU ARE GOING AND RETURNING SAFELY ARE THE BEST 
GIFTS YOU CAN GIVE YOUR FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND SHIPMATES.

6.  I AM HONORED TO SERVE WITH YOU AND TO WITNESS THE UNDENIABLE GOOD YOU 
DELIVER ACROSS THE GLOBE EVERY DAY.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, AND WHAT YOUR 
FAMILIES DO TO SUPPORT YOU, AND I WISH YOU A WONDERFUL HOLIDAY SEASON.
