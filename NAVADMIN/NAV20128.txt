NARR/REF (A) ESTABLISHES THE IMPORTANCE CNO GILDAY PLACES ON FLEET LEARNING.  
REF (B) TASKS NAVAL HISTORY AND HERITAGE COMMAND TO DEVELOP LESSONS LEARNED 
AND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT AND INFORM NAVY OPERATIONS, PLANS, AND PROGRAMS.

RMKS/1.  Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) ADM Michael M. Gilday is committed 
to taking every opportunity during this time to support and enhance fleet 
learning.
As he noted in FRAGO 01/2019, "Learning is the ultimate warfare enabler and 
the intellectual development of our Sailors provides our most critical 
warfighting capabilities."

2.  This NAVADMIN provides Navy leaders with ideas and online resources on 
how to apply naval history and heritage to increase warfighting 
effectiveness.  It also provides resources for the at-home education of 
school-age children.  This NAVADMIN addresses NHHC’s online resources.  To 
easily access all these resources, visit NHHC's website at 
www.history.navy.mil/about-us/for-the-fleet.html.

3.  Navy leaders of all levels are encouraged to take the opportunity during 
this time to apply the lessons of naval history and heritage.
A critical capability and indispensable leadership tool at any time, studying 
naval history is even more important in eras of great power competition and 
fundamental changes in technology that threaten to change the character of 
naval warfare and challenge the Navy's ability to adapt.
    a.  Studying naval history sharpens the ability of Navy leaders to think 
critically about the future and isolate what they need to think about.
    b.  Examining how naval leaders confronted similar challenges and created 
and leveraged comparative advantages shortens learning cycles.
None of today’s challenges are new: how the Navy and Marine Corps grappled 
with such issues in the past can and should inform decisions today.
    c.  Reading about how Navy leaders from Fleet Admiral Ernest King to Cook
    Third Class Doris Miller dealt with challenges and opportunities provides 
indispensable insights on how to lead.
    d.  Studying history yields an understanding of the Navy’s institutional 
beliefs, core values, and heritage of resilience that helps leaders set 
expectations, foster esprit de corps, and instill a warfighting ethos.

4.  Ideas and Online Resources for All Navy Leaders.
    a.  CNO Naval History Essay Contest: Form teams to think about topics and
write submissions to the 2020 CNO Naval History Essay Contest.
The deadline is 31 May.  (See NAVADMIN 283/19 and

    d  Research and update the history of their unit or installation or in 
the case of ships, research ships whose names they now bear.  For NHHC's 
research guide to units, see 
https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/research-guides/military-
service-records-and-unit-histories-a-guide-to-locating-sources.html.  (This 
page contains information for the other services’ history centers and 
museums.) To research a unit's Command Operations Reports, Deck Logs, and 
Combat Action Reports, seehttps://www.history.navy.mil/research/ 
archives.html.
For summary histories of ships and squadrons, see NHHC's respective 
dictionaries; look under the Research tab on the NHHC website and then select 
the Histories tab.  COs and CMCs are encouraged to inquire if NHHC holds 
artifacts from their commands or organizations and how NHHC might loan them 
when operations return to normal.  For information about NHHC's collection of 
art, artifacts, and photographs, see https://www.history.navy.mil/our-
collections.html.  NHHC has an extensive inventory of online images available 
for reproduction.  Leaders are also encouraged to plan milestone unit 
anniversaries and commemorate fallen comrades and Navy-wide events like the 
Navy Birthday, Battle of Midway, and Vietnam War.
For Navy-wide events, NHHC has online toolkits with information, graphics, 
and talking points; see https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-
topic/commemorations-toolkits.html.  For On-This-Day notes for PODs, see

can also assist PAOs to promote outreach for their unit’s commemorations; 
contact NHHCPublicAffairs@navy.mil.
    e.  Research how Navy leaders confronted similar challenges in the past, 
how they applied history then, and how they built esprit de corps and unit
resilience. These individuals could include a ship’s namesake such as Rear 
Admiral Grace Hopper and Sergeant Darrell S. Cole and other notable and 
trail-blazing figures such as Rear Admiral Samuel L. Gravely, Jr. and Rear 
Admiral Alene Duerk.
NHHC holds an expansive online biographies, which contains associated photos, 
artifacts; see 
https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/bibliographies.html,
https://www.history.navy.mil/research/ histories/biographies-list.html, and

biographical-files-ndl.html.  NHHC also has a multi-media gallery; see 
https://www.history.navy.mil/news-and-events/multimedia-gallery/news-

topic/people.html.  
For oral histories, see https:// www.history.navy.mil/research/library/oral-
histories.html.
    f.  Research the top three warfighting challenges your unit or warfare
community may face and learn how past naval leaders addressed similar
challenges. Challenges(and historical antecedents) might include: anti-access 
(kamikazes); expansion  of threats to sea control across more domains 
(Soviets in the 1960s); strategic planning in a fiscally restrained era 
(interwar); economic warfare and strategic planning in a globalized era 
(Royal Navy before WWI); strategic planning amid great power competition 
(1980s); logistics (Pacific Campaign); forging institutional consensus 
(1980s); Navy-Marine Corps integration (Pacific Campaign); developing C4I and 
weapons systems (interwar, WWII, and Cold War); damage control (USS SAMUEL B. 
ROBERTS); fleet response to pandemic (Spanish Influenza); fleet 
experimentation and concept development (interwar); irregular and riverine 
warfare (Vietnam and Operation Iraqi Freedom); ASW (WWII, 1960s-80s); race 
and gender issues (CNO Zumwalt); use of the EMS (Vietnam) and space (late 
Cold War); failing to learn (Operation Drumbeat, 1942); and failing to adapt 
(battles off Guadalcanal).
For ideas, see https://www.history.navy.mil/ research.html, the Online 
Reading Room at https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-
room.html, and https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic.html.  Leaders 
are invited to send lists of challenges, antecedents, and sources to NHHC for 
insights and recommendations.
