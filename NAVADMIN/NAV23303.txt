COMMISSIONING DOCUMENTS. 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN discusses the Military Service Obligation (MSO) and 
reiterates Selected Reserve (SELRES) requirements for first term officer and 
enlisted Sailors transitioning from Active Duty at the completion of their 
Active Duty service obligation. 
 
2.  Background.  As outlined in references (a) through (d), all Sailors incur 
an 8 year MSO, and any portion of which that is not completed on Active Duty 
or Active Duty for training must be completed in the Reserve Component.  As 
directed in reference (e), all new enlistment and commissioning contracts 
executed on or after 1 October 2020 for Sailors under a 4 year Active Duty 
service obligation were written to include a minimum of 4 years Active Duty, 
followed by up to 2 years of SELRES service, and 2 years of Individual Ready 
Reserve (IRR) service to reach the required 8 years total. 
 
3.  Policy.  Any Sailor who entered into a Service contract on or after  
1 October 2020, who is separating from Active Duty with less than 6 years' 
Time in Service (TIS) is subject to required SELRES service as determined by 
the needs of the Navy.  The amount of time required in the SELRES is equal to 
6 years minus the amount of Active Duty service (e.g., Sailors who separate 
with 4 years and 6 months of Active Duty service may be required to serve 1 
year and 6 months in the SELRES).  After completion of 6 years TIS, Sailors 
may then be transitioned to the IRR to serve the remainder of their MSO. 
Sailors transitioning from Active Duty to the SELRES are granted a 2 year 
deferment from involuntary mobilization. 
    a.  For Enlisted Sailors required to transition to SELRES at End of 
Active Obligated Service (EAOS) or Soft End of Active Obligated Service 
(SEAOS), SELRES quota requests will be automatically generated in the Career 
Waypoints (CWAY) System for adjudication by Reserve Community Managers based 
upon the needs of the Navy.  The quotas will be generated monthly from T-10 
months to T-4 months to the Sailor's EAOS/SEAOS to determine if SELRES 
service will be required.  All members with an approved quota will be 
contacted by the PERS-9 Reserve Processing and Affiliation Center (RPAC) 
regarding their SELRES affiliation. 
         (1) Sailors whose rating is not available in the Selected Reserve 
are not required to affiliate with the SELRES and may transition directly to 
the IRR.  If a Sailor in this category desires to affiliate with the SELRES, 
they may request a rating conversion to an available rating. 
        (2) Sailors with more than 6 years TIS are still encouraged to 
affiliate with the SELRES via CWAY, but are not required to do so. 
         (3) Command Career Counselors shall ensure that Sailors influenced 
by this policy are counseled at the earliest opportunity or during scheduled 
Career Development Boards on their future service options, potential SELRES 
obligations, benefits, and entitlements. 
    b.  For officers, the Commanding Officer or Executive Officer shall 
counsel the resigning officer on their potential for required SELRES 
service.  Upon approval of their resignation by PERS-45, all officers will be 
contacted by the Navy Recruiting Reserve Command (NRRC) Outreach team 
regarding their SELRES affiliation. 
 
4.  Additional Information.

join/reserve/transitioning-to-reserve. 
 
5.  Points of Contact. 
    a.  For general career questions, Sailors should contact their Command 
Career Counselors or MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) at (833) 330-6622 or email 
at askmncc@navy.mil. 
    b.  For specific designator/rate/rating questions and concerns regarding 
SELRES, Sailors should contact the respective Reserve community manager. 
    c.  For questions related to reserve benefits and affiliation, 
Sailors should contact the NRRC Outreach Team at nrrc_rpac@navy.mil. 
    d.  For assistance transitioning to SELRES, Sailors should contact RPAC 
at cto.enlisted@navy.mil. 
 
6.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled.
