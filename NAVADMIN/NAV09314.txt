SUBJ/MILITARY FAMILY APPRECIATION MONTH// 

GENTEXT/REMARKS/ 1.  NOVEMBER MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON 
AND GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO HONOR OUR NAVY FAMILES DURING NATIONAL 
MILITARY FAMILY APPRECIATION MONTH.  AS WE SPEND TIME WITH OUR FAMILIES, 
LET US NOT FORGET THEIR SUPPORT AND DEDICATION FOR SAILORS AND NAVY 
CIVILIANS SERVING AROUND THE GLOBE.  WE COULD NOT DO WHAT WE DO WITHOUT 
THEIR SERVICE, UNDERSTANDING, AND SACRIFICE.

2.  TODAY'S NAVY IS A GLOBAL FORCE FOR GOOD.  FORTY PERCENT OF OUR 
SHIPS ARE SAILING THE WORLD'S OCEANS ON ANY GIVEN DAY, AND 52,000 
SAILORS ARE DEPLOYED GLOBALLY - 14,000 OF WHOM ARE ON THE GROUND IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST.  CARRYING OUT OUR NAVY MISSION IS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH 
THE SUPPORT AND DEDICATION OF OUR NAVY FAMILIES.  WHILE OFTEN FAR FROM 
HOME, ONE THING REMAINS CONSTANT - THE LOVE AND SUPPORT OF OUR FAMILIES.

3.  THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AND ESPECIALLY THIS MONTH, I ASK ALL OF YOU TO 
JOIN ME IN EXPRESSING OUR GRATITUDE TO OUR NAVY FAMILIES WHO PROUDLY 
STAND BY US AT HOME AND AROUND THE GLOBE.

4.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
