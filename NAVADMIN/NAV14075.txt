RMKS/1. This NAVADMIN provides background, guidance, and coordinating 
instructions for use of the Navy Lessons Learned System, reference (a). The 
Navy Lessons Learned System is the singular Navy program for collection, 
validation and distribution of unit or staff feedback, as well as correction 
of problems identified and derived from fleet operations, exercises and other 
miscellaneous events.

2. Lessons, observations, and recommendations from past events are critical 
to the development of future capabilities, and contribute to safe and 
effective operations. For this reason, it is imperative that all hands 
contribute to and leverage the wisdom embedded in our Navy Lessons Learned 
System.    

3. In accordance with references (b) and (c), the Navy Lessons Learned 
Information System (NLLIS) is now integrated within the Joint Lessons Learned 
Information System (JLLIS), but retains a distinct Navy entry portal through 
which the Navy Lessons Learned System continues to operate in sync with other 
services and combatant commanders to provide direct access to lessons learned 
across the DoD. The Navy portal into JLLIS makes available tens of thousands 
of observation reports and port visit reports from 1985 to the present.

4. Observations submitted to JLLIS are routinely analyzed and used by 
services and combatant commanders to improve current and future operations. 
Following operations, exercises and other miscellaneous events, participating 
units should submit observations and recommendations utilizing the Navy 
lessons learned information system online at the following websites:

a. NIPRNET https://www.jllis.mil (cac required)/Email: 
navylessonslearned(at)navy.mil.  
b. SIPRNET http://www.jllis.smil.mil.Email: 
navylessonslearned(at)navy.smil.mil.  
c. Collaboration at sea (siprnet) at  
Http://www.uar.cas.navy.smil.mil/nwdc/nll/nll.nsf.

5. Elements of a good observation include: 
a. A detailed description of the observed event that addresses questions of 
who, what, when, where, why, and how.
b. A description of the situation that prompted the submission of the 
observation.
c. A description of options to avoid or alleviate the problem or recommended 
ways to improve upon existing methods.
d. A description of potential risks if recommendations are not adopted.
e. Observations are not limited to shortfalls or inefficiencies. Positive 
observations, innovations, and best practices are also strongly encouraged.

6. Prior to an operation, exercise, port visit or other high interest/complex 
event, participating units and staffs should take advantage of existing fleet 
observations and recommendations using built-in search tools and libraries 
within JLLIS and ensure relevant insights are shared and considered during 
pre-event
planning and preparations. During preparations for an event, commanders 
should direct subordinates to record observations for later submission into 
NLLIS. This direction should be reinforced during event execution.

7. Following the completion of an event, commanders should ensure 
subordinates promptly record and submit lessons learned, observations and 
recommendations into JLLIS via NLLIS.
  
8. Point of contact is Captain Dan Brune, Navy Warfare Development Command, 
Navy Lessons Learned and Analysis Department Head, N5l at (757) 341-4211/DSN 
341, or via email; dan.brune(AT)navy.mil.

9. Additional training on the use of NLLIS and collection of observations is 
available online at the JLLIS website or in person from the fleet lessons 
learned site representatives located at each of the geographic numbered fleet 
headquarters.
