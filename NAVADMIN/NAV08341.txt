SUBJ/PATERNITY LEAVE IMPLEMENTATION// REF/A/DOC/S.3001/14OCT2008// 
AMPN/REF A IS THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT (NDAA) 2009.// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES IMPLEMENTATION OF PATERNITY LEAVE AS 
AUTHORIZED BY THE FY09 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT. 
EFFECTIVE 14 OCTOBER 2008, THE PATERNITY LEAVE POLICY GRANTS TEN DAYS 
OF NON-CHARGEABLE LEAVE TO A MARRIED MEMBER OF THE NAVY ON ACTIVE DUTY 
WHOSE WIFE GIVES BIRTH TO A CHILD.  THIS LEAVE MUST BE TAKEN IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH THE BIRTH OF THE CHILD.
2.  PATERNITY LEAVE PROVIDES DEDICATED TIME FOR A SAILOR TO ESTABLISH 
LONG TERM CHILD CARE ROUTINES AND ADDRESS NEW PARENTING 
RESPONSIBILITIES, WHICH HELP CREATE THE HEALTHY NAVY FAMILIES WE RELY 
ON TO DEFEND OUR NATION.  PATERNITY LEAVE IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE 
CHANGING PERSPECTIVE OF WORK/FAMILY NEEDS AMONG CURRENT WORKFORCE 
DEMOGRAPHICS.  DURING THE 2007/2008 TASK FORCE LIFE/WORK ROADSHOW, OVER 
68 PERCENT OF PARENTAL POLICY REVISION REQUESTS WERE RELATED TO THE 
NEED FOR PATERNITY LEAVE.  CURRENTLY ONLY 13 PERCENT OF U.S. EMPLOYERS 
OFFER PAID PATERNITY LEAVE.  INCORPORATING THIS PROGRESSIVE POLICY INTO 
THE NAVY BENEFITS PACKAGE DEMONSTRATES OUR DEDICATION TO NAVY FAMILIES 
AND OUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO BEING A TOP 50 EMPLOYER.  
3.  SPECIFIC NAVY POLICY WILL BE REFLECTED IN MILPERMAN 1050-430 AS
FOLLOWS:
    A.  PATERNITY LEAVE MAY BE GRANTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH ORDINARY 
LEAVE.
    B.  COMMANDING OFFICERS WILL GRANT LEAVE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS 
DEPENDENT ON THE UNIT'S MISSION, SPECIFIC OPERATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, 
AND SERVICE MEMBER'S BILLET. 
    C.  PATERNITY LEAVE MUST BE TAKEN WITHIN 365 DAYS OF THE BIRTH OF 
THE CHILD.  WAIVERS TO THIS POLICY MUST BE SUBMITTED TO OPNAV N130 FOR 
APPROVAL, WITH AN EXPLANATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PREVENTED USE OF 
PATERNITY LEAVE. 
    D.  THE FULL TEN DAYS OF PATERNITY LEAVE NEED NOT BE TAKEN IN A 
SINGLE BLOCK.  HOWEVER, PERIODS OF NON-CHARGEABLE LEAVE MAY NOT BE 
TAKEN CONSECUTIVELY IN CONJUNCTION WITH LIBERTY OR SPECIAL LIBERTY. 
    E.  THE 10 DAY ENTITLEMENT REMAINS THE SAME FOR MULTIPLE BIRTHS 
(TWIN, TRIPLETS, ETC). 
4.  MEMBERS WHO HAVE USED EARNED LEAVE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BIRTH OF 
A CHILD ON OR AFTER 14 OCTOBER 2008 SHOULD CONTACT THEIR PERSONNEL
