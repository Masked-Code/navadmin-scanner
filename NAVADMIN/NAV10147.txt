1.  IN ORDER TO GIVE NAVY A REAL TIME CENSUS OF OUR MOTORCYCLE RIDER 
POPULATION AND GIVE COMMANDS A TOOL THAT WILL ENABLE THEM TO MONITOR 
MOTORCYCLE RIDER TRAINING STATUS, A MOTORCYCLE SAFETY MANAGEMENT TOOL 
IS NOW HOSTED ON THE WEB ENABLED ENTERPRISE SAFETY APPLICATION 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (ESAMS).  ESAMS IS CURRENTLY USED THROUGHOUT THE 
COMMANDER, NAVY INSTALLATIONS COMMAND ENTERPRISE TO MANAGE THEIR SAFETY, 
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND FIRE PROGRAMS.  ACCESS TO ESAMS IS AVAILABLE TO 
ALL NAVY COMMANDS TO MANAGE THEIR COMMAND MOTORCYCLE SAFETY TRAINING, 
TRACKING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

2.  REF A REQUIRES ALL COMMANDS TO IDENTIFY ALL DOD PERSONNEL WHO OWN 
OR PLAN TO PURCHASE A MOTORCYCLE AND ENSURE 100 PERCENT COMPLIANCE WITH 
TRAINING AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS.  REF B 
REQUIRES ALL NAVY COMMANDS TO APPOINT A MOTORCYCLE SAFETY 
REPRESENTATIVE (MSR).
3.  EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, EVERY COMMAND MSR, AND ASSISTANT, WHERE 
APPLICABLE, SHALL USE ESAMS TO MANAGE THEIR COMMAND MOTORCYCLE SAFETY 
PROGRAM WITHIN THE FOLLOWING TIMELINE:
A.  EVERY COMMAND MSR SHALL CONTACT THE ESAMS REPRESENTATIVE FOR AN 
ELECTRONIC USERS GUIDE AND ESTABLISH A COMMAND PROFILE AND PASSWORD 
WITHIN 30 DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THIS MESSAGE.
B.  EVERY COMMAND MSR SHALL RECEIVE TRAINING ON THE UTILIZATION OF 
ESAMS WITHIN 90 DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THIS MESSAGE.  
C.  EVERY COMMAND MSR SHALL POPULATE ESAMS WITH ALL REQUIRED MOTORCYCLE 
RIDER INFORMATION WITHIN 120 DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THIS MESSAGE.
4.  ISICS MAY CONTACT THE ESAMS REPRESENTATIVE FOR ACCESS AND, IF 
DESIRED, COORDINATE ON-LINE TRAINING FOR THEIR COMMANDS.  THE ESAMS 
CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE IS MR. MARLO GRAPE AND CAN BE CONTACTED 
AS FOLLOWS:  (CONUS)     1-866-249-7314; (OCONUS) 809-463-3376 THEN 1-
866-249-7314; (E-MAIL) MARLO.GRAPE (AT) HGWLLC.COM.
5.  COMMANDS UNABLE TO MEET PARAGRAPH 3 TIMELINES SHALL NOTIFY THEIR 
ECHELON 3 COMMANDER VIA NAVAL MESSAGE AND STATE THE REASON THEY COULD 
NOT MEET THE TIMELINE, THEIR PLAN OF ACTION TO COMPLY AND THE EXPECTED 
DATE THEY WILL COMPLY.
6.  IN FISCAL YEAR 2009, MOTORCYCLE FATALITIES WERE DOWN 61 PERCENT FOR 
NAVY AND 44 PERCENT FOR THE MARINE CORPS.  THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED 
POSITIVE CHANGE THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO TRAINING AND LEADERSHIP.  
LOSING SAILORS AND MARINES IS TRAGIC AND HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON 
MORALE AND READINESS. WE MUST CONTINUE TO BE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN WHAT 
OUR SAILORS AND MARINES DO OFF DUTY AND GET 100 PERCENT OF OUR 
MOTORCYCLE RIDERS IDENTIFIED AND TRAINED.
