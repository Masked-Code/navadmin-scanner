SUBJ/U.S. NAVY SENIOR ENLISTED ACADEMY (SEA) UPDATE//

REF/A/COMNAVPERSCOM/11SEP16//
AMPN/REF A IS MILPERSMAN 1306-925 ARTICLE, SENIOR ENLISTED ACADEMIES (SEA)//

RMKS/1.  This message updates the Senior Enlisted Academies (SEA) class 
schedule discussed in reference (a) for the Navy SEA and highlights funding 
challenges for Select Reserve (SELRES) students.

2.  The SEA is adjusting its course length from 9 weeks of distance learning 
(DL) to 7-weeks DL to better support the fleet and reduce the impact on 
commands.  Additionally, the reduction in length allows the SEA to hold more 
classes per year, providing more flexibility and opportunities to attend.

3.  The 7 week DL course format is constructed as follows:  7 weeks of DL at 
parent command, followed by one week of admin time, and concluded by 3 weeks 
of in residence (IR) education in Newport, RI, totaling 11 weeks from start 
to finish.  This format will go into effect for FY-18 classes, beginning with 
SEA Class 209.

4.  SELRES:  The following items apply for SELRES students only:
    a.  Two SEA classes each year are designated for SELRES students who 
cannot attend 3 weeks in residence.  These students will complete the same 7 
week DL, followed by 2 weeks of admin time, followed by 2 weeks of in 
residence education.  All in residence course material will be compressed 
from 3 weeks to 2 weeks for these classes in order to fulfill academic 
requirements.
    b.  Experience shows that funding for SELRES to attend the IR portion is 
often a limiting factor, requiring the student to drop the class after 
completing the entire DL phase.  SELRES students should secure funding early 
in the process to ensure their quota is not lost.

5.  See the SEA website for further detail at:
