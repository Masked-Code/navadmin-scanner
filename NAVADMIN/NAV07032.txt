SUBJ/OBSERVANCE OF WOMEN_S HISTORY MONTH 2007// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THAT MARCH 2007 MARKS THE 
20TH ANNUAL OBSERVANCE OF WOMEN_S HISTORY MONTH, A TIME WHEN THE NAVY 
CELEBRATES AND RECOGNIZES THE MANY CONTRIBUTIONS WOMEN HAVE MADE TO OUR 
NAVY AND NATION.  THE PUBLIC CELEBRATION OF WOMEN_S HISTORY IN THIS 
COUNTRY BEGAN IN 1978 AS  WOMEN_S HISTORY WEEK  IN SONOMA COUNTY, 
CALIFORNIA.  IN 1987, CONGRESS EXPANDED THE CELEBRATION TO A MONTH, AND 
MARCH WAS DECLARED WOMEN_S HISTORY MONTH.
2.  THIS YEAR_S THEME:   GENERATIONS OF WOMEN MOVING HISTORY FORWARD
RECOGNIZES THE WISDOM AND TENACITY OF THE GENERATIONS OF WOMEN WHO HAVE 
COME BEFORE US AND THOSE WHO WILL FOLLOW.  THE YEAR 1908 SAW THE FIRST 
GENERATION OF WOMEN IN THE NAVY WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NURSE 
CORPS AND TODAY COMPRISES 15 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL FORCE.
TODAY_S GENERATION OF WOMEN INCLUDES TWO THREE-STAR ADMIRALS, 14 TOTAL 
ACTIVE DUTY FEMALE FLAG OFFICERS WITH THREE FEMALE FLAG SELECTEES.  
WOMEN ARE COMMANDING MAJOR COMMANDS, COMBATANT SHIPS, AVIATION 
SQUADRONS, CIVIL ENGINEER CORPS COMMANDS, AND NUMEROUS OTHER 
OPERATIONAL AND SHORE COMMANDS.  THERE ARE CURRENTLY SEVEN WOMEN IN 
COMMAND OF SURFACE COMBATANTS, THREE IN AVIATION COMMAND AND 44 
ENLISTED WOMEN SERVING AS COMMAND MASTER CHIEFS.
3.  THIS PAST YEAR MARKED SEVERAL  FIRSTS OF THEIR GENERATION; VADM ANN 
RONDEAU, FIRST FEMALE DEPUTY COMMANDER OF A UNIFIED COMMAND; RDML CAROL 
POTTINGER, FIRST FEMALE COMMANDER OF A FORWARD DEPLOYED OPERATIONAL 
AMPHIBIOUS GROUP; CAPTAIN PEG KLEIN, FIRST FEMALE COMMANDANT OF 
MIDSHIPMEN AT THE US NAVAL ACADEMY; CAPTAIN CYNTHIA TALBERT, FIRST 
FEMALE LIMITED DUTY OFFICER (LDO) CAPTAIN; AND, FLEET MASTER CHIEF 
JACQUELINE DIROSA (SW/AW), FIRST FEMALE FLEET MASTER CHIEF.  THESE ARE 
JUST A FEW OF THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS WOMEN CONTINUE TO MAKE EACH 
DAY THROUGHOUT THE FLEET.  IN HIS DIVERSITY POLICY CNO EXPLAINS, 
EVERYONE IN OUR NAVY CONTRIBUTES TO MISSION SUCCESS, AND EVERYONE 
BRINGS TO THAT COLLECTIVE EFFORT UNIQUE CAPABILITIES AND INDIVIDUAL 
TALENT.  INCREASING WOMEN IN TECHNICAL FIELDS AND RATINGS REMAINS A CNO 
TOP PRIORITY, LIKE ANY ORGANIZATION IN TIME OF CHANGE, WE THRIVE ON THE 
INFUSION OF NEW IDEAS AND THE DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT.
4.  WE SALUTE THE WOMEN IN THE NAVY, BOTH MILITARY AND CIVILIAN, AND 
ENCOURAGE ALL COMMANDS TO RECOGNIZE WOMEN_S HISTORY MONTH BY SPONSORING 
LOCAL ACTIVITIES AND EXHIBITS, PUBLISHING ITEMS OF INTEREST IN COMMAND 
BULLETINS, AND SOLICITING INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATION IN APPROPRIATE 
OBSERVANCES.
5.  THE WOMEN_S MEMORIAL FOUNDATION WILL CELEBRATE THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE MEMORIAL_S DEDICATION 18-20 OCT 2007 WITH A GALA DINNER,
