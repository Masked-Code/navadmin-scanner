GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  PRESERVING OUR NAVAL HISTORY IS AN IMPORTANT
ENDEAVOR.  NOT ONLY DOES PRESERVING OUR HISTORY ENABLE US TO LOOK
BACK PROUDLY ON OUR BEGINNINGS AS A SERVICE, BUT IT CAN PROVIDE
IMPORTANT LESSONS FOR ALL OF US, INFORMING DECISIONS AS WE PLAN AND
EXECUTE OUR PROGRAMS INTO THE FUTURE.  THE NAVAL HISTORICAL CENTER,
UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE DIRECTOR OF NAVAL HISTORY (DNH), IS
CHARGED WITH COLLECTING, PRESERVING, INTERPRETING, AND COMMUNICATING
OUR NAVY S HISTORY AND RICH HERITAGE TO OUR SAILORS AND THE AMERICAN
PUBLIC.
2.  OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE INSTITUTED A
NUMBER OF INITIATIVES CENTERED ON FURTHERING THIS JOURNEY OF
HISTORICAL DISCOVERY AND MAINTAINING OUR FOCUS ON NAVAL HISTORY.
SOME OF THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE:
    - TASK FORCE HISTORY - ESTABLISHED IN FEBRUARY 2003, THE GOAL
OF TASK FORCE HISTORY WAS TO PROVIDE ACCURATE AND THOROUGH
DOCUMENTATION OF NAVY OPERATIONS AND PLANNING IN CONNECTION WITH THE
GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM.  FOLLOWING THE ATTACKS OF 11 SEPTEMBER,
NUMEROUS MEMBERS OF THE NAVAL HISTORICAL CENTER RESERVE COMBAT
DOCUMENTATION UNIT WERE MOBILIZED TO CAPTURE THE PLANNING AND
EXECUTION OF NAVY PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM.
THESE EFFORTS CONTINUE TODAY.  MOST RECENTLY, DETACHMENTS FROM THE
RESERVE UNIT DEPLOYED AROUND THE GLOBE TO DOCUMENT TSUNAMI RELIEF
EFFORTS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF NAVY RESPONSE.
    - COMMAND HISTORY INSTRUCTION REVISION - REF A STREAMLINED
REPORTING BY COMBINING SEPARATE EXISTING REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMAND
HISTORY REPORTS, WAR DIARIES, AND COMMANDER S OPERATIONAL REPORTS
INTO A SINGLE ANNUAL REPORT.  COMMAND OPERATIONS REPORTS, ALONG WITH
MONTHLY DECK LOG SUBMISSIONS FROM COMMISSIONED NAVY SHIPS (REF B),
ARE THE ONLY OFFICIAL RECORDS OF A COMMAND S OPERATIONS THAT ARE
DESIGNATED FOR PERMANENT RETENTION.  THESE FORM THE BASIS FOR
CREATION OF UNIT HISTORIES AND ARE USED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS
INCLUDING OPERATIONAL ANALYSES, HISTORICAL RESEARCH, AND RESPONSE TO
REFERENCE REQUESTS BY INDIVIDUALS.  AS AN EXAMPLE, THESE ARE OFTEN
THE PRINCIPLE RECORDS THROUGH WHICH NAVY VETERANS CAN SUBSTANTIATE
VA DISABILITY CLAIMS.  IT IS CRITICAL THAT ALL COMMANDERS,
COMMANDING OFFICERS, AND OFFICERS IN CHARGE COMPLY WITH THE
REQUIREMENTS FOR ANNUAL COMMAND OPERATIONS REPORTING TO ENSURE THAT
THE HISTORICAL RECORD MAINTAINED FOR THEIR COMMAND IS ACCURATE AND
COMPLETE.
    - ADDITIONAL COMBAT DOCUMENTATION UNIT BILLETS - 35 BILLETS HAVE
BEEN ADDED TO THE ROLES OF THE NAVAL HISTORICAL CENTER RESERVE
COMBAT DOCUMENTATION UNIT IN ORDER TO SUPPORT HISTORICAL
DOCUMENTATION TEAMS ASSIGNED TO OPERATIONAL NAVY COMMANDS AND THE
SHORE ESTABLISHMENT.  THE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WILL ASSURE THAT
RELIABLE HISTORIES - OPERATIONS, PROCEDURES, ACHIEVEMENTS, AND
CHALLENGES - OF THESE COMMANDS, AS WELL AS RELATED HISTORICAL
RECORDS AND ARTIFACTS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC RECORDS AND INFORMATION,
ARE COLLECTED, MAINTAINED, AND PRESERVED.
    - NAVY MUSEUM SYSTEM REALIGNMENT - PER REF C, THE VICE CHIEF OF
NAVAL OPERATIONS APPROVED A PLAN TO REALIGN ALL NAVY MUSEUMS UNDER
THE DIRECTOR OF NAVAL HISTORY.  THIS ALIGNMENT WILL BRING THE BEST
BUSINESS PRACTICES TO BEAR ACROSS THE NAVY MUSEUM SYSTEM.  IT WILL
PROVIDE MORE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN THE AREAS OF
MANPOWER, COLLECTIONS PRESERVATION, ACCOUNTABILITY, EXHIBITIONS, AND
OUTREACH, AS WELL AS ADDRESSING GROWING CONGRESSIONAL INTEREST IN
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MUSEUM OPERATIONS WHILE CONTINUING TO
ENCOURAGE LOCAL FOUNDATION SUPPORT AND LOCAL COMMAND INTEREST.  THE
TRANSITION, WHICH WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN FY-06, WILL INVOLVE ALL
MUSEUM DIRECTORS, THEIR COMMANDERS, AND CONSTITUENCIES (SUPPORTED
WARFARE COMMUNITIES AND COMMANDS).  REVISION OF REF D, AS WELL AS
APPLICABLE MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING AND OTHER AGREEMENTS WITH
BASES, SUPPORTING FOUNDATIONS, AND OTHER PARTIES WILL BE COMPLETED.
3.  FINALLY, IT WAS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT RADM PAUL E. TOBIN, USN
(RET) HAS BEEN SELECTED AS THE NEXT DIRECTOR OF NAVAL HISTORY AND
CURATOR FOR THE NAVY.  THIS SELECTION WAS MADE FROM A VERY
COMPETITIVE POOL OF OUTSTANDING CANDIDATES.  RADM TOBIN S
DISTINGUISHED RECORD, INCLUDING DESTROYER, CRUISER, AND TASK FORCE
COMMAND, AS WELL AS TOURS AS COMMANDING OFFICER OF SURFACE WARFARE
OFFICERS SCHOOL, DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,
DIRECTOR OF NAVAL COMMUNICATION/INFORMATION SYSTEMS, VICE CHIEF OF
NAVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING, AND AS OCEANOGRAPHER OF THE NAVY,
MAKES HIM EXCEPTIONALLY WELL QUALIFIED TO LEAD THE NAVYS HISTORICAL
PROGRAM INTO THE 21ST CENTURY.
