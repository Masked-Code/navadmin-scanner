NOTE 1: VESSEL IS DESIGNATED FOR FOREIGN MILITARY SALE (FMS). WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF NON-TRANSFERRABLE TECHNOLOGY IDENTIFIED BY NAVSEA AND NAVY IPO 
UNDER SEPCOR, NO ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT REMOVALS ARE AUTHORIZED ON THE FRIGATES 
EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED BY OPNAV N9I (FORMERLY N8F) IN RESPONSE TO A 
RECORD MESSAGE REQUEST THAT INCLUDES JUSTIFICATION FOR REMOVAL AND INCLUDES 
COORDINATION  VIA THE APPROPRIATE SYSTEMS COMMAND. TYCOMS ARE REQUIRED TO 
ENSURE STRICT ADHERENCE TO THIS DIRECTION. PER REFS B AND C, IT IS NAVY POLICY 
THAT SHIPS DESIGNATED FOR FMS TRANSFER SHALL NOT BE STRIPPED. STRIPPING OF 
SHIPS PROVIDES DIMINISHED OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY TO MARITIME PARTNERS AND 
CORRODES OUR EFFORTS TO BUILD MARITIME PARTNER CAPACITY. SEE PARAGRAPH 4 FOR 
ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT REMOVAL GUIDANCE.
NOTE 2: VESSEL WILL BE RETAINED OUT-OF-COMMISSION/IN-RESERVE (OCIR).

REPORTED TO THE CNO AND NVR CUSTODIAN IAW REFS C AND D.

4. AN OPNAV WORKING GROUP IS BEING ESTABLISHED TO REVIEW THE LOGISTICAL NEEDS 
OF THE NAVY AND THE CAPABILITY NEEDS OF OUR MARITIME PARTNERS. FLEET REPS, 
PROGRAM OFFICES, AND FMS STAKEHOLDERS WILL BE PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
JUSTIFY THEIR REQUIREMENTS FOR EQUIPMENT REMOVALS AND EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES TO 
MITIGATE IMPACT TO THE FLEET AND INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS AS PART OF THAT 
REVIEW. REF E PROVIDES ADDITIONAL DETAILS OF THE OPNAV WORKING GROUP FORUM.

5. PER REFS C AND F, FLEET COMMANDERS SHALL SUBMIT AN ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE 
REQUEST (OCR) TO FORMALLY NOTIFY OPNAV OF A DECOMMISSIONING EFFECTIVE DATE. A 
REVISED OCR SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO ADJUST THE EFFECTIVE DATE DUE TO OPERATIONAL 
SCHEDULE CHANGES.

6. PER REF C, SHIP COMMANDING OFFICERS/MASTERS SHALL SEND A NAVAL MESSAGE 
ANNOUNCING THE ACTUAL DECOMMISSIONING DATE. IT SHALL BE ADDRESSED TO CNO 
WASHINGTON DC//00/09/N1/N2/N6/N4/N3/N5/N8/N9/. INFO ADDEES SHALL INCLUDE THE 
CHAIN OF COMMAND, ALL APPROPRIATE SUPPORT ACTIVITIES, COMNAVSEASYSCOM 
WASHINGTON DC//SEA 05C// AND NAVHISTHERITAGECOM WASHINGTON DC. MESSAGE SHOULD 
GIVE A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE LIFE OF THE SHIP TO INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT EVENTS.

7. ADJUSTMENTS TO A DECOMMISSIONING OR INACTIVATION DATE THAT CROSSES THE 
CURRENT FISCAL YEAR MUST BE COORDINATED WITH OPNAV N9I IAW REF C  DUE TO THE 
REPORTING REQUIREMENT THAT NAVY MUST INFORM CONGRESS ON  EXECUTION YEAR FORCE 
STRUCTURE CHANGES THAT DIFFER FROM WHAT CONGRESS AUTHORIZED/APPROPRIATED AND 
SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE PRESIDENT. OPNAV SHALL PROMULGATE CHANGES TO THE 
INACTIVATION YEAR AS REQUIRED.
