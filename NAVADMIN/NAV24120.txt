RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN message designates the Deputy Chief of Naval 
Operations for Information Warfare (OPNAV N2N6) to manage and 
administratively oversee Security Management Office (SMO) affiliation and 
Defense Information System for Security (DISS) accountability for reviewing 
Navy personnel and security records per reference (a).  The review also 
satisfies the Secretary of the Navy's (SECNAV) follow-on guidance in response 
to the Air National Guardsman/DISCORD Unauthorized Disclosure incident. 
 
2.  To achieve compliance with reference (a), all Navy commands with an 
intelligence mission (SCI/Controlled Access Program/Special Access Program) 
and all Navy commands with a non-intelligence mission (Secret/Top Secret) 
will complete the following actions by 15 July 2024: 
    a.  Command activity security managers (ASMs) and special security 
officers (SSOs) will ensure that all personnel under their SMO cognizance 
have (1) a valid and appropriate security clearance, 
(2) a fully executed non-disclosure agreement, and (3) a valid need to know 
before allowing access to CNSI at any level. 
    b.  ASMs and SSOs will ensure accurate DISS SMO files for all DON 
personnel in their respective DISS SMO subject lists through a comprehensive 
review of personnel records.  An accurate DISS record verification indicates 
a verified need to know, a non-disclosure agreement signature date in DISS 
for each assigned record, valid (SCI and/or collateral) accesses recorded in 
DISS, and appropriate SMO ownership by the sponsoring command ASM or SSO. 
    c.  ASMs and SSOs will provide a report of compliance to the Navy 
Cognizant Security Authority (CSA)/SSO Navy at 
ssonavyhq_scipolicy@us.navy.mil.  The report must include: 
        (1) SMO code. 
        (2) ASM/SSO point of contact (name, title, phone/email). 
        (3) Higher echelon reporting command/SMO POC. 
        (4) Any discrepancies found in DISS SMO verification and resolution. 
        (5) Notification of a non-managed SMO 
(no assigned users or managers) that can be deactivated within DISS. 
 
3.  ASMs and SSOs are to adhere to the emerging requirement per reference (a) 
to conduct an annual self-inspection of DISS recordkeeping.  Certification of 
full and accurate DISS ownership will be submitted to Navy CSA/SSO Navy 
annually by 1 December for consolidation and reporting to CNO via Director, 
Navy Staff/OPNAV N2N6 and to SECNAV via the Deputy Under Secretary of the 
Navy for Intelligence and Security.  Annual self-inspection requirements will 
be integrated into Navy Inspector General reviews of Navy commands with CNSI 
security requirements. 
 
4.  This NAVADMIN message will remain in effect until canceled or superseded.
