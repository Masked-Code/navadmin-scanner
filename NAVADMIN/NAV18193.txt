SUBJ/NOTICE OF CONVENING FY-19 ACTIVE-DUTY NAVY COMMANDER AND CAPTAIN 
SELECTIVE EARLY RETIREMENT BOARDS//

RMKS/1.  As we seek to grow the Navy, we remain focused on warfighting and 
lethality by ensuring we have the right officer talent to meet the mission of 
the Navy.  To this end, the Secretary of the Navy approved the convening of 
FY-19 Selective Early Retirement (SER) Boards, for regular captains and 
commanders on the active-duty list by grade and competitive category.  The 
boards will convene on 13 September 2018 and are strictly about ensuring 
quality, not force management.

2.  The decision to hold FY-19 SER boards was made after considerable thought 
and careful deliberation.  Our growing Navy requires the most consistently 
reliable top performers to lead and sustain a modern, ready and lethal force 
as the number of ships and squadrons and required manpower levels increase.  
We are committed to retaining and promoting the right leaders to meet the 
challenges of tomorrow, and enforcing the highest performance standards sets 
for Navy leaders the necessary tone and expectation for subordinates to 
emulate.  SER boards are comparable to the already successful Senior Enlisted 
Continuation Board process for quality control of our senior leaders.  Each 
board will select only those officers whose early retirement, in the opinion 
of a majority of the board members, is in the best interest of the Navy.  
When determining those officers who should be recommended for early 
retirement, the SER boards will consider a number of factors, including 
performance, the requirement for exemplary conduct, and adverse information.  
The majority of the officers whose records are being reviewed for these 
boards are fully capable of performing the duties of their current grade.  
Selecting zero officers in a competitive category is an acceptable outcome 
for these boards because no mandatory quotas have been established.  The 
process of reviewing records and selecting officers for early retirement 
ensures the Navy will have a professional, healthy senior officer corps that 
is ready to meet the demands of the Navy the Nation needs.

3.  The following officers may be considered for SER:
    a.  Captains (O-6).  Officers who are in year groups specified in 
paragraph 6, have 3 or more years time in grade, and who are within the zone 
defined in paragraph 6 for their competitive category.
    b.  Commanders (O-5).  Officers who are in year groups specified in 
paragraph 6, who have failed of selection for promotion to the grade of 
captain two or more times, and who are within the zone defined in paragraph 6 
for their competitive category.

4.  The following officers are not eligible for consideration by the SER 
board:
    a.  Officers with approved voluntary retirement requests.
    b.  Officers with statutory retirements in FY-18 or FY-19.
    c.  Officers whose names are on a list of officers recommended for 
promotion.

5.  Officers selected for early retirement will be formally notified as soon 
as possible after the proceedings of the boards are approved.  Officers 
selected and approved for early retirement are required by law to be retired, 
if retirement eligible, on the first day of the seventh month after the month 
in which the board report is approved.  For the FY-19 SER boards, this 
mandatory retirement date is anticipated to be 1 May 2019.  If an officer is 
not eligible for retirement, then the officer will be retained on active duty 
until the officer is qualified for retirement, then retired not later than 
the first day of the month beginning after the month in which the officer 
becomes qualified for retirement.

6.  The following list indicates the name, active-duty list (lineal) number, 
and date of rank of the senior officer and junior officer who are eligible 
for consideration for early retirement in the following competitive 
categories.  All officers listed below, as well as those whose lineal number 
falls between the senior and junior officer listed, will be considered by the 
SER boards, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4.
