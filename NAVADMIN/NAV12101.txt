RMKS/1.  ONE OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO EVERY COMMANDING OFFICER IN 
CREATING A CLIMATE OF INCLUSION IS THE COMMAND MANAGED EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 
(CMEO) PROGRAM MANAGER.  PROPERLY CONDUCTING THE COMMAND CLIMATE ASSESSMENT 
HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A SYSTEMIC ISSUE DURING NAVY INSPECTOR GENERAL VISITS.  
TO HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, NAVY EO OFFICE WILL PROVIDE TAILORED TRAINING TO 
YOUR CMEO PROGRAM MANAGER.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES, INCLUDING EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY ADMINISTRATION OF 
THE COMMAND CLIMATE ASSESSMENTS.  ADDITIONALLY, CMEOS WILL RECEIVE TRAINING ON 
THE MILITARY EQUAL OPPORTUNITY NETWORK (MEONET), EO/SH COMPLAINT PROCESSING, 
HAZING AND THE COMMAND CLIMATE ASSESSMENT PROCESS.  THE TRAINING WILL LEVERAGE 
REGION AND LOCAL EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ADVISORS (EOA) TO BETTER FAMILIARIZE TENANT 
COMMANDS WITH THESE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS.  SINCE THE TRAINING WILL ALSO 
INCLUDE SMALL GROUP "HANDS ON" COMMAND CLIMATE ASSESSMENT EXERCISES FOR THE 
CMEO PROGRAM MANAGERS, THIS TRAINING IS BEST DELIVERED FACE-TO-FACE.
