SUBJ/OBSERVANCE OF 2013 HOLOCAUST DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE OBSERVANCE OF THE 2013 HOLOCAUST DAYS OF 
REMEMBRANCE.  THIS YEARS THEME, "NEVER AGAIN:
HEEDING THE WARNING SIGNS", WILL BE OBSERVED 7-14 APRIL 2013.

2.  ESTABLISHED BY CONGRESS IN 1980 AS THE NATION'S ANNUAL COMMEMORATION OF 
THE HOLOCAUST, THE DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE INCLUDES THE OBSERVANCE OF "YOM 
HASHOAH," OR HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY, ON
8 APRIL 2013.

3.  THE HOLOCAUST WAS THE STATE-SPONSORED SYSTEMATIC ANNIHILATION OF EUROPEAN 
JEWS BY NAZI GERMANY AND ITS COLLABORATORS.  BETWEEN 1933 AND 1945, MORE THAN 
SIX MILLION JEWS WERE MURDERED WHILE POLES, SOVIET PRISONERS OF WAR, GYPSIES, 
JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES, POLITICAL DISSIDENTS, THE PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY 
DISABLED, AND HOMOSEXUALS SUFFERED GRIEVOUS PERSECUTION UNDER NAZI TYRANNY.

4.  IN ORDER TO PREVENT GENOCIDE IN THE FUTURE, WE MUST LOOK BACK 80 YEARS TO 
THE INCREMENTAL EVENTS LEADING TO THE HOLOCAUST AND EXAMINE HOW INDIVIDUALS, 
ORGANIZATIONS, COUNTRIES, AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY RESPONDED OR IGNORED 
WARNING SIGNS.  THESE PIVOTAL MOMENTS SHOW US THE IMPACT OF FEAR AND OF 
INDIFFERENCE COMPARED TO THE COURAGE OF A FEW.  AS WE REFLECT, WE VOW TO 
REMAIN VIGILIANT TO THE SURREPTITIOUS INVASION OF HATRED, WHICH CORRODES HUMAN 
DIGNITY.

5.  PRIOR TO 1944 THE TERM "GENOCIDE" DID NOT EXIST.  A POLISH-JEWISH LAWYER 
NAMED RAPHAEL LEMKIN SOUGHT TO DESCRIBE NAZI POLICIES OF SYSTEMATIC MURDER, 
INCLUDING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE EUROPEAN JEWS DURING THE HOLOCAUST.  HE 
FORMED THE WORD "GENOCIDE" BY COMBINING GENO-, FROM THE GREEK WORD FOR RACE OR 
TRIBE, WITH -CIDE, FROM THE LATIN WORD FOR KILLING.  IN 1948, THE UNITED 
NATIONS VOTED TO ESTABLISH GENOCIDE AS AN INTERNATIONAL CRIME, CALLING IT AN 
"ODIOUS SCOURGE" TO BE CONDEMNED BY THE CIVILIZED WORLD.  DEFINING, ACCEPTING, 
AND REFLECTING ON THE CONCEPT OF "GENOCIDE" IS A NECESSARY STEP IN PREVENTING 
RECCURENCES OF THE ATTROCITIES OF THE HOLOCAUST.

6.  DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT ON ALL WHOSE LIVES 
WERE LOST OR FOREVER ALTERED BY THE HOLOCAUST.  THIS WEEK CHALLENGES US TO 
THINK ABOUT WHAT WOULD MOTIVATE US TO RESPOND TO WARNING SIGNS OF GENOCIDE 
TODAY.  HISTORY TEACHES THAT GENOCIDE CAN BE PREVENTED.  OUR CHOICES IN 
RESPONDING TO HATRED MATTER, AND ACTING TOGETHER WE CAN ENSURE THESE ACTIONS 
NEVER REOCCUR.

7.  ALL COMMANDS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE HOLOCAUST
