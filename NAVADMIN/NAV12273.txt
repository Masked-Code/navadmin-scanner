RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES REVISED SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS (SRB) 
AWARD LEVELS FOR ACTIVE COMPONENT (AC) AND RESERVE COMPONENT FULL TIME SUPPORT 
(FTS), AND SUPERSEDES REF A.  INCREASED AWARD LEVELS ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY 
AND DECREASED LEVELS ARE EFFECTIVE 30 DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THIS NAVADMIN.

2.  POLICY UPDATES CONTAINED IN THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDE GUIDANCE REGARDING 
UPCOMING CHANGES TO THE SRB ANNIVERSARY PAYMENT POLICY IN ADVANCE OF A PENDING 
UPDATE TO REF C.   SPECIFICALLY, ALL SAILORS REENLISTING AND RECEIVING THEIR 
INITIAL SRB PAYMENT ON OR AFTER 1 OCTOBER 2012 WILL RECEIVE ANNUAL SRB 
INSTALLMENTS DURING THE ANNIVERSARY MONTH OF THEIR REENLISTMENT DATE (E.G., 
SAILORS REENLISTING IN DECEMBER 2012, WILL RECEIVE THEIR INITIAL SRB PAYMENT 
UPON REENLISTMENT, THEIR NEXT ANNUAL INSTALLMENT IN DECEMBER 2013, AND ALL 
SUBSEQUENT INSTALLMENTS ANNUALLY IN DECEMBER UNTIL THE FULL CONTRACTED 
DISBURSEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED).  SAILORS UNDER CURRENT SRB CONTRACTS, AS WELL 
AS THOSE REENLISTING PRIOR TO 1 OCTOBER 2012, WILL BE GRANDFATHERED UNDER THE 
SRB ANNIVERSARY PAYMENT POLICY STATED IN PARA 13 OF REF C, AND CONTINUE TO 
RECEIVE ANNIVERSARY PAYMENTS ANNUALLY IN OCTOBER UNTIL THE FULL CONTRACTED 
DISBURSEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED.

3.  THIS MESSAGE TEMPORARILY LIFTS THE RESTRICTION PREVENTING MEMBERS WITH 
FY13 EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE (EAOS) DATES FROM REENLISTING FOR 
SRB IN FY12.  ACCORDINGLY, ALL FY13 EAOS SAILORS (REGARDLESS OF SRB TIER) ARE 
ENCOURAGED TO APPLY FOR SRB AND REENLIST ON OR BEFORE 30 SEPTMBER 2012.  FY13 
EAOS SAILORS ELECTING TO  REENLIST IN FY12 ARE AUTHORIZED TO SUBMIT SRB 
REQUESTS WITHOUT REGARD TO THE 35-DAY PRECERTIFICATION REQUIREMENT OUTLINED IN 
PARA 8 BELOW, BUT  MUST BE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE FOR SRB IAW REF C AND HAVE A 
VALID PTS QUOTA PRIOR TO THEIR SELECTED REENLISTMENT DATE.  STANDARD EARLY 
REENLISTMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR TOP PERFORMING SAILORS OUTLINED IN PARA 7 BELOW 
REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR THOSE FY13 EAOS SAILORS THAT DO NOT ELECT OR DO NOT 
RECEIVE APPROVAL TO REENLIST FOR SRB BEFORE
1 OCTOBER 2012.

4.  CONTINUING WITH THE POLICY INITIATED BY REF B, REENLISTMENT REQUESTS FOR 
THE FOLLOWING SRB AWARD LEVELS WILL BE APPROVED BASED ON QUOTA AVAILABILITY.  
AS WITH PTS, ELIGIBLE SAILORS DESIRING SRB REENLISTMENT ARE ENCOURAGED TO WORK 
WITH THEIR CHAIN OF COMMAND AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE WITHIN THEIR REENLISTMENT 
WINDOW TO MAXIMIZE POTENTIAL FOR SRB.  PERS-811 (SRB DESK) MAINTAINS THE 
CURRENT LIST OF SRB ELIGIBLE RATINGS/SKILLS, BASED ON AVAILABLE QUOTAS, AT 
HTTP://WWW.PUBLIC.NAVY.MIL/BUPERS-
NPC/CAREER/ENLISTEDCAREERADMIN/PAGES/SRB.ASPX.  FOR THOSE COMMANDS WITH 
LIMITED INTERNET ACCESS, COMMAND CAREER COUNSELORS SHOULD CONTACT PERS-811 
DIRECTLY FOR THE LATEST UPDATES.

5.  FTS NEW REENLISTMENT CONTRACTS FOR SRB ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING ACCEPTED.  
AC SRB AWARD LEVELS ARE AS FOLLOWS (NOTE:  AN "*" INDICATES LEVEL LOCATED IN 
OTHER SECTIONS OF PARA 5, A "-" INDICATES A REDUCTION FROM PREVIOUS AWARD 
LEVEL, A "+" INDICATES AN INCREASE FROM PREVIOUS AWARD LEVEL):

6.  NOTES
    A.  THE SRB FOR THIS RATING NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION (NEC) IS TIED TO 
AN INCUMBENT BILLET OR TO ORDERS NEGOTIATED FOR THE NEXT BILLET.  COMMANDS 
MUST VERIFY THE MEMBER IS CURRENTLY IN, OR HAS ORDERS TO, A BILLET REQUIRING 
THIS NEC AND ANNOTATE THIS VERIFICATION IN THE COMMENTS SECTION OF THE PRECERT 
REQUEST.
    B.  AN SRB APPROVAL FOR ALL CT, IT, AND ITS RATINGS WILL BE CONTINGENT 
UPON MEMBER HAVING A CURRENT SINGLE SCOPE BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION (SSBI), AN 
ACTIVE SSBI, OR RECENT SUBMISSION OF AN SSBI PACKAGE.  COMMANDS MUST VERIFY 
THE MEMBER HAS A CURRENT SSBI, ACTIVE SSBI, OR HAS SUBMITTED A SSBI PACKAGE 
AND MAKE NOTE OF THIS IN THE COMMENTS SECTION OF THE PRECERT REQUEST.
    C.  MEMBERS HOLDING INACTIVE NUCLEAR NECS 3359 AND 3389 MAY REENLIST AT 
THE AWARD LEVEL SPECIFIED FOR THE LAST ACTIVE NEC HELD WITH PRIOR ECM APPROVAL 
VIA E-MAIL AT NXAG_N133D2(AT)NAVY.MIL OR AT (703) 604-5491/DSN 664.  
REENLISTMENT COMPENSATION FOR ZONE C NUCLEAR TRAINED PERSONNEL HOLDING A 
NUCLEAR SUPERVISOR NEC SHALL BE PROVIDED UNDER THE ENLISTED SUPERVISOR 
RETENTION PAY (ESRP) PROGRAM IAW POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DETAILED IN REF D.
    D.  LETTERS APPEARING WITH AN NEC ARE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE USE ONLY.
    E.  SUBSURFACE OR SURFACE DESIGNATION DOES NOT MEAN AN INDIVIDUAL MUST BE 
SUBSURFACE OR ENLISTED SURFACE WARFARE SPECIALIST QUALIFIED, BUT INDICATES THE 
COMPONENT OF THE RATING IN WHICH THEY CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO SERVE.  
TRAINING, QUALIFICATIONS, AND PREVIOUS OR PROJECTED DUTY ASSIGNMENTS AT SEA 
WILL INDICATE THE APPROPRIATE RATING COMPONENT.  WHEN USING THE FORCE 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (FORMAN) AND THE OFFICER PERSONNEL INFORMATION SYSTEM 
(OPINS) TO INPUT A SRB PRECERT REQUEST, USE THE RATING (WITH APPROPRIATE 
SUFFIX DESIGNATION)/NEC AS SPECIFIED IN THIS NAVADMIN.  FOR EXAMPLE, SURFACE 
ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN WITH NO NEC WOULD SUBMIT 'ETSW' ON PRECERT FOR RATING.
    F.  SUBSURFACE NECS.  SUBSURFACE ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN 14XXA IDENTIFIES 
ALL SUBSURFACE ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN COMMUNICATIONS SAILORS WHO HOLD NECS 
BEGINNING WITH 14.  SUBSURFACE ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN NAVIGATION 14XXB 
IDENTIFIES SUBSURFACE ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN NAVIGATION SAILORS AND INCLUDES 
ALL SUBSURFACE ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN NAVIGATION NECS BEGINNING WITH 14.
    G.  RATINGS ELIGIBLE FOR NEC 0304 ARE:  AWO, ET, QM, AND OS.
    H.  NEC 0000 (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS "QUAD ZERO") IS LISTED HERE TO 
ESTABLISH THAT SAILORS IN THESE RATINGS/CAREER FIELDS CAN HOLD ANY OR NO NEC 
AND STILL BE QUALIFIED FOR SRB PROVIDED THEY MEET ALL OTHER APPLICABLE NON-NEC 
RELATED CRITERIA.

7.  EARLY REENLISTMENT OPPORTUNITY:  SAILORS SERVING IN TIER ONE SKILLS, AS 
WELL AS THE EXCEPTIONS OUTLINED IN PARA 12.A OF REF B AND PARA 4 OF REF C, ARE 
ELIGIBLE TO REENLIST EARLY ANY TIME WITHIN THE FISCAL YEAR OF THEIR EAOS.  
NUCLEAR SAILORS MAY STILL CROSS FISCAL YEAR BOUNDARIES.  ADDITIONALLY, SAILORS 
SERVING IN TIER TWO OR TIER THREE SRB SKILLS WHO RECEIVED AN EP IN BLOCK 45 OF 
THEIR MOST RECENT REGULAR PERIODIC EVALUATION OR FITNESS REPORT WILL BE 
ALLOWED TO REENLIST EARLY ANY TIME WITHIN THE FISCAL YEAR OF THEIR EAOS.  NO 
TRANSFER, CONCURRENT, OR SPECIAL EVALUATIONS WILL APPLY.  SAILORS ADVANCED 
WITHIN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THEIR EAOS WILL BE ALLOWED TO SUBSTITUTE THE 
LAST REGULAR PERIODIC EVALUATION OR FITNESS REPORT IN THEIR PREVIOUS PAYGRADE.  
PERSONNEL MUST FAX OR E-MAIL A SIGNED COPY OF THE EVALUATION TO PERS-811 ONCE 
THEIR PRECERT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED.
THIS REQUIREMENT IS ONLY FOR THOSE THAT FALL UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS 
PARAGRAPH.

8.  SRB PRECERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
    A.  PERFORM-TO-SERVE (PTS):  COMMANDS ARE AUTHORIZED TO SUBMIT SRB 
REENLISTMENT REQUESTS PRIOR TO A MEMBER RECEIVING A PTS QUOTA; HOWEVER, THE 
PTS QUOTA REQUEST MUST HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND THE SRB REQUEST WILL NOT BE 
PROCESSED UNTIL THE MEMBER HAS RECEIVED PTS CONFIRMATION.  SRB REQUESTS 
WITHOUT PTS APPROVAL WILL BE REJECTED IN OPINS TO KEEP THE COMMAND INFORMED OF 
POTENTIAL SRB APPROVAL ISSUES.  ONCE A MEMBER HAS AN APPROVED PTS QUOTA, THE 
COMMAND SHOULD CONTACT PERS-811 TO CLEAR ANY REJECTIONS.
    B.  COMMANDS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT SRB REENLISTMENT REQUESTS TO
PERS-811 VIA OPINS 35-120 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE SAILOR'S REQUESTED 
REENLISTMENT DATE.  REQUESTS SUBMITTED LESS THAN 35 DAYS PRIOR TO THE 
REQUESTED REENLISTMENT DATE WILL BE REJECTED; HOWEVER, COMMANDS MAY CONTACT 
PERS-811 FOR WAIVER ELIGIBILITY AND PROCEDURES.  SAILORS MUST HAVE APPROVED 
PRECERTS BEFORE REENLISTING.  THE SERVICING PERSONNEL OFFICE IS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR VERIFYING THE REENLISTMENT, POSTING THE CONTRACT, RELEASING THE FIRST 
PAYMENT, AND VERIFYING THE MASTER MILITARY PAY ACCOUNT.
    C.  SAILORS WITH APPROVED PRECERTS WHO DO NOT REENLIST ON THE DATE OR FOR 
THE TERM SPECIFIED IN THE PRECERT MESSAGE, MUST HAVE THEIR COMMAND CONTACT 
PERS-811 TO INITIATE A REENLISTMENT CANCELLATION TO AVOID OVERPAYMENT.
    D.  TO VALIDATE AN INOPERATIVE EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT AND EXPEDITE 
PROCESSING OF AN SRB REQUEST; INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN THE REMARKS PARAGRAPH 
OF THE REQUEST:  TERM, NARRATIVE REASON, AUTHORITY, AND EXECUTION DATE OF ALL 
INOPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  FAILURE TO VERIFY EXTENSIONS WILL CAUSE PROCESSING 
DELAYS AND MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF THE REQUEST OR AN APPROVAL AT A LOWER 
AMOUNT.
    E.  SAILORS MUST OBTAIN AN APPROVAL FOR EXTENSION FROM PERS-811 IN ORDER 
TO MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF SRB ELIGIBILITY.

9.  THE FOLLOWING GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED ON NEC-SPECIFIC SRB AND LATERAL 
CONVERSIONS.  ACCEPTANCE OF AN NEC-SPECIFIC SRB CONTRACT INDICATES AN 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SAILOR AND THE NAVY TO UTILIZE SKILLS ATTRIBUTED TO THE 
NEC DURING THE SAILOR'S ENLISTMENT TO MEET FLEET READINESS REQUIREMENTS.  IN 
SUBSEQUENT TOURS, A SAILOR MUST BE WILLING TO BE DETAILED DURING THE NORMAL 
PROJECTED ROTATION DATE WINDOW TO AN AVAILABLE BILLET WITHIN THE SRB 
CONTRACTED NEC, CONSISTENT WITH SEA-SHORE FLOW REQUIREMENTS.  LATERAL 
CONVERSIONS MUST FOLLOW REF B, PARA 12.D.  LATERAL CONVERSION REQUESTS WILL 
NOT BE PROCESSED MORE THAN NINE MONTHS BEFORE THE EAOS.  CONVERSIONS TO A RATE 
WITH A LOWER AWARD LEVEL WILL NOT BE APPROVED.  PERSONNEL IN A 'CLOSED-LOOP' 
NEC CAN REENLIST BY THE NEC ONLY.

10.  OBLIGATED SERVICE TO TRAIN (OTT) AND THEN REENLIST.  SEE REF B, PARA 
12.E., FOR OTT GUIDANCE.  REQUESTS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED TO PERS-811 VIA NAVPERS 
1306/7, ENLISTED PERSONNEL ACTION REQUEST.  A COPY OF THE AUTHORIZATION 
MESSAGE SHOULD BE RETAINED BY THE SAILOR UNTIL THE SRB REENLISTMENT ON 
GRADUATION DAY FROM THE COURSE OF INSTRUCTION.  USE CODE 1CC (1RC FOR FTS) FOR 
OTT SRB REQUESTS IN OPINS.

11.  INOPERATIVE EXTENSIONS POLICY.  IN KEEPING WITH DOD POLICY, PERSONNEL WHO 
ACCEPTED AN ENLISTMENT BONUS FOR EXTENDED ENLISTMENT (EBEE), AS REFLECTED ON 
THEIR NAVCRUIT 1133/52, ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE THIS INOPERATIVE EXTENSION 
TIME IN THE SRB CALCULATION.  SAILORS WHO HAVE INOPERATIVE EXTENSION TIME 
THROUGH A FIVE-YEAR OBLIGATION OR SIX-YEAR OBLIGATION PROGRAM, OR AS 
AUTHORIZED IN NAVADMIN 007/09, MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE UP TO 24-MONTHS OF 
INOPERATIVE EXTENSION TIME COUNT TOWARDS THE SRB CALCULATION PROVIDED THE 
REENLISTMENT RESULTS IN A NEW EAOS THAT IS AT LEAST 24-MONTHS DAY-FOR-DAY PAST 
THE CURRENT EXTENDED EAOS.  THIS CALCULATION IS PERFORMED AUTOMATICALLY BY 
PERS-811.  LOCAL COMMANDS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO CANCEL OR CHANGE EXTENSIONS 
FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMMEDIATE SRB REENLISTMENTS.  COMMANDS MUST VERIFY AND 
ANNOTATE ON THE PRECERT REQUEST WHETHER ANY INOPERATIVE EXTENSION TIME NOTED 
IS PART OF AN EBEE CONTRACT.

12.  RECOUPMENT.  THE FOLLOWING IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LATEST OSD 
GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED IN REF E AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON RECOUPMENT 
POLICY NOT SPECIFICALLY COVERED IN PARA 18 OF REF C.  AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS 
PAID:  A BONUS; SPECIAL OR INCENTIVE PAY; AND THE RECEIPT IS CONTINGENT UPON 
THE INDIVIDUAL FULFILLING SPECIFIED  CONDITIONS OF ELIGIBILITY, SERVICE, OR 
ASSIGNMENT, SHALL REPAY THE UNITED STATES QQQQ  ANY UNEARNED PORTION OF THE 
BONUS, OR SPECIAL OR INCENTIVE PAY IF THE INDIVIDUAL FAILS TO FULFILL THE 
CONDITIONS OF ELIGIBILITY, SERVICE,  OR ASSIGNMENT AND MAY NOT RECEIVE ANY 
UNPAID AMOUNT OF THE BONUS OR  SPECIAL OR INCENTIVE PAY AFTER FAILING TO 
FULFILL SUCH SPECIFIED CONDITIONS.
SITUATIONS REQUIRING REPAYMENT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:
    A.  AN APPROVED REQUEST FOR VOLUNTARY RELEASE FROM THE WRITTEN AGREEMENT 
SPECIFYING THE CONDITIONS FOR RECEIPT OF THE BONUS OR VOLUNTARY SEPARATION 
FROM THE NAVAL SERVICE;
    B.  AN APPROVED VOLUNTARY REQUEST FOR RELIEF FROM A QUALIFYING ASSIGNMENT;
    C.  FAILURE TO EXECUTE ORDERS TO A BILLET COMMENSURATE WITH THE 
INDIVIDUAL'S SPECIALTY OR SKILL, GRADE, OR CAREER PROGRESSION;
    D.  DISABILITY OR PHYSICAL DISQUALIFICATION RESULTING FROM MISCONDUCT, 
WILLFUL NEGLECT, OR INCURRED DURING A PERIOD OF UNAUTHORIZED ABSENCE;
    E.  SEPARATION OR REASSIGNMENT RESULTING FROM A MEDICAL CONDITION NOT 
AMOUNTING TO A DISABILITY (AS DEFINED IN MILPERSMAN 1910-120);
    F.  SEPARATION FOR CAUSE, INCLUDING MISCONDUCT;
    G.  AN APPROVED DETACHMENT FOR CAUSE; AND
    H.  SEPARATION BY REASON OF WEIGHT CONTROL AND/OR PHYSICAL READINESS TEST 
FAILURE.

13.  LITTORAL COMBAT SHIP (LCS) GUIDANCE.  SAILORS ASSIGNED TO LCS PLATFORMS 
OR WITH ORDERS TO AN LCS PLATFORM WHO POSSESS MULTIPLE NEC'S SPECIFICALLY 
REQUIRED FOR LCS ASSIGNMENT ARE AUTHORIZED TO REENLIST FOR THE MOST LUCRATIVE 
SRB-ELIGIBLE NEC, REGARDLESS OF ASSIGNED RATING.
