SUBJ/OBSERVANCE OF HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 2005//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH WILL BE OBSERVED
FROM 15 SEPTEMBER TO 15 OCTOBER 2005, WITH THE THEME OF "HISPANIC
AMERICANS:  STRONG AND COLORFUL THREADS IN THE AMERICAN FABRIC."
2.  HISPANICS HAVE A LONG AND PROUD TRADITION AS SAILORS, SERVING
BRAVELY AND HONORABLY IN THE U.S. NAVY DURING EVERY WAR AND CONFLICT
SINCE THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.  THIS TRADITION IS STRONGER THAN EVER
IN TODAY'S DIVERSE NAVY.  ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT CENSUS

WHO ARE OF HISPANIC ORIGIN.  OF THESE, 31,000 SERVE PROUDLY IN THE
U.S. NAVY.
3.  HONORING AND CELEBRATING HISPANIC SAILORS SENDS OUT A POSITIVE
MESSAGE NOT ONLY TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY BUT TO THE ENTIRE NATION.
THAT THIS ORGANIZATION HAS THE WILLINGNESS TO STEP FORWARD AND SAY
WE ARE PROUD OF OUR HISPANIC SAILORS AND THE SERVICE THEY DO FOR OUR
COUNTRY.
4.  COMMANDS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO CELEBRATE HISPANIC HERITAGE
MONTH THROUGH EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, EXHIBITS, PUBLICATIONS, AND
PARTICIPATION IN MILITARY AND COMMUNITY EVENTS THAT RECOGNIZE THE
PROFOUND CONTRIBUTIONS OF HISPANIC AMERICANS TO THE GREAT NAVY AND
THE NATION THEY SO PROUDLY SERVE.
