RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES CHANGES TO THE FY-13 GENERAL MILITARY 
TRAINING (GMT) SAPR TRAINING REQUIREMENT AND AUTHORIZES COMPLETION OF SEXUAL 
ASSAULT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE-FLEET (SAPR-F) TRAINING TO SATISFY THE SAPR 
GMT REQUIREMENT FOR FY-13.

2.  BACKGROUND.
    A.  AS ANNOUNCED IN REFS A AND B, THE NAVY IS COMPLETING SAPR-F TRAINING 
AS THE NEXT STEP IN THE NAVY'S CONTINUUM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION 
TRAINING.  ALL COMMANDS WERE DIRECTED TO COMPLETE SAPR-F TRAINING FOR E6 AND 
BELOW PERSONNEL NLT 31 MARCH 2013.
    B.  TO DATE, SAPR-F COMPLETION IS WELL AHEAD OF SCHEDULE WITH OVER 80 
PERCENT OF THE NAVY'S E6 AND BELOW DOCUMENTED COMPLETE IN THE FLEET TRAINING 
MANAGEMENT PLANNING SYSTEM (FLTMPS).

3.  AS AUTHORIZED BY THIS NAVADMIN, COMPLETION OF SAPR-F BY E6 AND BELOW 
PERSONNEL WILL ALSO SATISFY THE FY-13 SAPR GMT TRAINING REQUIREMENT IN REF C.

4. THE CENTER FOR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT HAS DEVELOPED AN 
ADDITIONAL TOOL THAT COMMANDS CAN USE TO MEET FY-13 SAPR GMT TRAINING FOR E7 
AND ABOVE.  A REVISED SAPR-F COURSE FACILITATION GUIDE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THAT 
UTILIZED SAPR-F MATERIAL AND SHIFTS THE FOCUS TO LEADERSHIP.  LIKE SAPR-F FOR 
E6 AND BELOW, THIS TRAINING WILL BE INTRODUCED BY A MEMBER OF THE COMMAND 
LEADERSHIP TRIAD AND DELIVERED BY AN APPROPRIATE LEADER APPROVED BY THE 
COMMANDING OFFICER; NO ADDITIONAL PREPARATION TRAINING SHOULD BE REQUIRED AS 
COMMANDS ALREADY HAVE SAPR-L/F TRAINED FACILITATORS.

5.  TO HIGHLIGHT COMMAND AWARENESS, COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO COMPLETE THIS 
TRAINING FOR E7 AND ABOVE DURING SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH IN APRIL.

6.  THE REVISED SAPR-F COURSE FACILITATION GUIDE FOR E7 AND ABOVE CAN BE 
DOWNLOADED FROM THE SAPR L/F TRAINING WEBPAGE AT 
HTTP://WWW.PUBLIC.NAVY.MIL/BUPERS-NPC/SUPPORT/SAPR/PAGES/TRAINING.ASP
X
OR FROM NKO (SELECT THE LEADERSHIP TAB AND SCROLL DOWN THE PAGE TO  THE SAPR 
TRAINING SECTION).  USE OF THE E6 AND BELOW FACILITATION GUIDE FOR E7 AND 
ABOVE IS NOT AUTHORIZED.

7.  PER REF C, GMT COMPLETION WILL BE DOCUMENTED BY ALL COMMANDS VIA FLTMPS.  
PREVIOUS FLTMPS DOCUMENTATION OF SAPR-F FOR E6 AND BELOW WILL AUTOMATICALLY 
DOCUMENT COMPLETION OF THE SAPR GMT LESSON, SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION AND 
RESPONSE REFRESHER TRAINING (CPPD-GMT-SAPRRT-1.0) ON 1 APRIL 2013.  AFTER 
CONDUCTING SAPR-F TRAINING FOR E7 AND ABOVE, COMMANDS WILL DOCUMENT COMPLETION 
IN FLTMPS UNDER CPPD-GMT-SAPRRT-1.0 (THIS COURSE IS STILL VALID AND MAY BE 
USED TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL SAPR TRAINING AS REQUIRED).
