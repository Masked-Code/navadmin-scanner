RMKS/1.  This message announces the Navy interim guidance for implementation 
of the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (LEOSA) program, directed by 
references (a) through (d) and in accordance with reference (e).

2.  Background.  The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2013 
expanded LEOSA 2004 coverage to include individuals who are or were 
authorized to apprehend under Article 7b of the UCMJ.  The NDAA of 2013 now 
applies to all Department of the Navy (DON) active and reserve personnel, 
whether assigned afloat or ashore, who are serving or have served in a law 
enforcement capacity as defined by references (a) through (d).

3.  Policy
     a. It is Navy policy that LEOSA credentials may be issued to current and 
retired Navy personnel who meet the criteria described in references (a) 
through (d).
     b. LEOSA card holders are subject to all restrictions and limitations 
contained in references (a) and (d), including:
          (1) LEOSA credentials do not permit the carry of concealed 
privately-owned weapons on Federal installations or where prohibited by 
federal, state, or local statutes.
          (2)  LEOSA credentials do not confer upon any separated law 
enforcement officer any rights or privileges accorded to a currently serving 
law enforcement officer.
     c. Issued credentials will immediately become invalid if an individual 
no longer meets any of the requirements for eligibility in this NAVADMIN or 
references (a) through (d).
     d. The Navy will not reimburse any cost associated with the 
qualification requirements contained in references (a) through (d) and this 
NAVADMIN, or provide firearms, ammunition, or firearms qualification testing 
for separated law enforcement officers.
     e. This message will serve as interim policy guidance for implementation 
of the Navy LEOSA program and will cancel upon release of OPNAVINST 5530.14F.

4.  Responsibilities
     a. Director, Shore Readiness Division (OPNAV N46) will promulgate policy 
regarding implementation of the Navy LEOSA program and update policy in 
accordance with any change to references (a) through (d).
     b. Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) will:
          (1)  In accordance with references (a) through (d), act as         
the program manager for the LEOSA program, providing administration and 
oversight of credential issuance for qualified law enforcement officers 
(QLEO) and qualified retired/separated enforcement officers (QRLEO).
          (2) Provide additional implementation guidance, as required.
          (3) Issue photographic credentials for a period not to exceed five 
years to QLEOs.
          (4) Issue non-expiring photographic credentials to QRLEOs.
          (5) In accordance with references (a) and (b), maintain data 
associated with QLEOs who have been issued the photographic credential.
          (6) In accordance with references (a) and (c), maintain data 
associated with QRLEOs who have been issued the photographic credential.
          (7) Recover credentials issued to QLEOs upon separation from law 
enforcement duties and for disqualifying performance or conduct that would 
result in a member losing authority to carry a firearm.
          (8) Ensure that the QLEO and QRLEO, upon issuance of the LEOSA 
credential, are aware of all credential restrictions and limitations 
contained in references (a) and (d), including that:
                (a) The credential does not grant any authority to act on 
behalf of the Department of the Navy or to exercise any law enforcement 
authority.
                (b) To carry a concealed firearm under LEOSA             
authority, the bearer must also carry, on their person, the issued LEOSA 
credential as well as qualification documentation issued by a certified 
firearms instructor within the QRLEOs state of residence that is current 
within 12 months.  QLEOs must also be in possession of a valid common access 
card.
                (c) The credential is invalid if the credential holder is 
found to be carrying a firearm while under the influence of alcohol or any 
other intoxicating or hallucinatory drug or substance.
                (d) Issuance of the credential does not grant an               
exemption from federal and state statutes and regulations that apply to the 
carry of firearms (to include those relating to the carry of firearms aboard 
commercial aircraft, within federal facilities, etc.).
     c. The installation commanding officer (CO) or first O-6/GS-15 within an 
applicant’s chain of command will be the initial endorsing authority for QLEO 
applicants.  Installation COs may delegate endorsing authority to their 
respective security officers.
