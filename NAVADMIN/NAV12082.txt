SUBJ/IMPLEMENTATION OF URINALYSIS TESTING FOR SYNTHETIC COMPOUNDS//

REF/A/DOC/SECNAV/23MAY11//
REF/B/DOC/OPNAV/4JUN09//
REF/C/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON DC/251705ZMAR10//
NARR/REF A IS SECNAVINST 5300.28E, MILITARY SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION AND 
CONTROL.  REF B IS OPNAVINST 5350.4D, NAVY ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION 
AND CONTROL.  REF C IS NAVADMIN 108/10, DRUG ABUSE ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY AND 
PROHIBITION ON POSSESSION OF CERTAIN SUBSTANCES.//

RMKS/1.  THE NAVY WILL BEGIN TESTING OF URINE SAMPLES FOR SYNTHETIC CHEMICAL 
COMPOUNDS SUCH AS SPICE THIS MONTH.  NAVY HAS ZERO TOLERANCE FOR DRUG ABUSE -- 
DRUG ABUSE (INCLUDING THE USE OF DESIGNER AND SYNTHETIC COMPOUNDS) BY MEMBERS 
OF THE NAVY IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE MAINTENANCE OF HIGH STANDARDS OF 
PERFORMANCE, MILITARY DISCIPLINE, READINESS, AND RELIABLE MISSION 
ACCOMPLISHMENT.  PER REFS A THROUGH C, THE WRONGFUL USE, POSSESSION, AND/OR 
DISTRIBUTION OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE PUNISHABLE UNDER THE UNIFORM CODE OF 
MILITARY JUSTICE.  

2.  URINALYSIS TESTING FOR SYNTHETIC COMPOUNDS DIRECTED BY THIS NAVADMIN IS 
SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM THE URINALYSIS PROGRAM DIRECTED UNDER REF B.  
TESTING WILL COMMENCE THIS MONTH USING THE MODEL CURRENTLY IN PLACE FOR 
STEROID TESTING.

3.  COMMANDERS, COMMANDING OFFICERS, OFFICERS-IN-CHARGE, OR THEIR DESIGNATED 
REPRESENTATVE MUST OBTAIN QUOTAS FOR TESTING FROM OPNAV N135 PRIOR TO 
COLLECTION OF A SYNTHETIC COMPOUND URINE SAMPLE, JUST AS IS REQUIRED FOR 
STEROID SAMPLE COLLECTION.  NAVY TESTING CAPACITY AND QUOTAS WILL INCREASE AS 
WE TRANSITION LATER THIS YEAR TO TESTING AT NAVY FACILITIES.  SAMPLES WILL BE 
COLLECTED USING CURRENT URINALYSIS PROCEDURES, EXCEPT THAT SYNTHETIC COMPOUND 
SAMPLE MATERIALS - BOTTLES, LABELS, BOXES, ETC., MUST BE PURCHASED WITH OPTAR 
AND SAMPLES WILL ONLY BE SHIPPED TO THE NAVY DRUG SCREENING LAB GREAT LAKES.  

4.  NAVAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE SERVICE (NCIS) AND COMMANDS WILL BE NOTIFIED 
OF POSITIVE SAMPLES.  FOR EACH POSITIVE SAMPLE:
    A.  NCIS WILL OPEN AN INVESTIGATION.
    B.  COMMAND MAY TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS RELATED TO HEALTH, SAFETY, AND 
SECURITY BASED ON POSITIVE RESULTS.
    C.  COMMANDERS MAY CONDUCT FURTHER INQUIRY IF MISCONDUCT IS SUSPECTED. 

5.  EXECUTION SPECIFICS FOR PROGRAM COORDINATORS, AND FURTHER GUIDANCE TO 
COMMANDERS, WILL BE PROVIDED VIA SEPARATE CORRESPONDENCE.

6.  ENGAGED LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATION OF OUR FORCE ON THE DANGERS OF SYNTHETIC 
COMPOUND ABUSE AND OUR ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY IS PARAMOUNT.  IT IS INCUMBENT 
UPON US TO ENSURE OUR PEOPLE KNOW THE RISKS THESE DRUGS PRESENT TO THEIR 
HEALTH, CAREER, AND TO THEIR FAMILY.    

7.  POINT OF CONTACT IS MS. DORICE S. FAVORITE, DIRECTOR, NAVY ALCOHOL AND 
DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION OFFICE, 901-874-4400/DSN 882-4400 OR VIA E-MAIL AT
