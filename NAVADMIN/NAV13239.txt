NARR/REF A IS DODINST 2200.01, COMBATING TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS (CTIP).  REF

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN establishes Navy policy and procedures for the 
execution of Combating Trafficking in Persons (CTIP) General Military 
training (GMT).  Department of Defense policy is to oppose prostitution, 
forced labor, and any related activities that may contribute to the 
phenomenon of Trafficking In Persons (TIP) as inherently harmful and 
dehumanizing.  TIP is a violation of U.S. law and internationally recognized 
human rights, and is incompatible with Navy Core Values. 

2.  Ref (a) requires each service to conduct an annual CTIP awareness 
training program for all component members.  Ref (b) establishes policies and 
procedures to implement the Navy's CTIP awareness program.  

3.  In light of the critical nature of this GMT lesson, it is essential that 
leadership is involved in making members of their command aware of this topic 
and the annual requirement to complete the CTIP online training lesson. 

4.  Commanding officers shall ensure CTIP GMT lessons are completed by all 
assigned personnel within each fiscal year.

5.  CTIP training can be taken via Navy Knowledge Online (NKO) at 
https://wwwa.nko.navy.mil.  Click on the learning tab, then click the Navy e-
learning image (located on the right side of the screen), then select the 
CTIP lesson titled Combating Trafficking in Persons (CTIP) Basic Awareness

6.  CTIP training is also available through the Total Workforce Management 
System (TWMS) at https://twms.nmci.navy.mil/selfservice/.  
Click online training and notices on the left hand side under the tools slash 
actions, and then click available training, scroll down and select

7.  Completion of either online course will automatically be documented via 
Fleet Training Management Planning System (FLTMPS).  Command delivered

completion forms.  Detailed instructions on the FLTMPS submission process are
