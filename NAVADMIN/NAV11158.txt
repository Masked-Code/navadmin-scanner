SUBJ/MILITARY SPOUSE APPRECIATION DAY// 

RMKS/1.  MILITARY SPOUSE APPRECIATION DAY, WHICH WE OBSERVE THIS YEAR ON MAY 
6, IS AN OCCASION TO HONOR THE MANY NAVY SPOUSES WHO SUPPORT OUR SERVICEMEN 
AND WOMEN IN THE WORK OF OUR NATION.  WHILE BALANCING FAMILY LIFE, MILITARY 
OBLIGATIONS, AND OFTEN CAREERS OF THEIR OWN, OUR HUSBANDS AND WIVES ENABLE THE 
GOOD OUR NAVY ACHIEVES ACROSS THE GLOBE EVERY DAY.

2.  AS WE CELEBRATE MILITARY SPOUSE APPRECIATION DAY, WE THANK OUR SPOUSES FOR 
THEIR LOVE AND SUPPORT THROUGH COUNTLESS DEPLOYMENTS; FOR THEIR PATIENCE OVER 
MANY HOUSEHOLD MOVES, SOMETIMES TO PLACES FAR FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY; FOR THE 
FAMILIES HELD TOGETHER, FOR THE ANNIVERSARIES, BIRTHDAYS, AND HOLIDAYS 
CELEBRATED ALONE; FOR THEIR HANDS EXTENDED TO ANOTHER MILITARY SPOUSE OR 
FAMILY WHEN THE NEED WAS THERE; AND FOR THE PRIDE IN SERVING THEIR 
COMMUNITIES.

3.  THE LIFE OF A MILITARY FAMILY IS A DEMANDING ONE, AND MANY OF ITS BURDENS 
NECESSARILY REST WITH OUR MILITARY SPOUSES SO OUR SAILORS CAN FOCUS ON THE 
MISSION AT HAND.  I EXTEND MY HEARTFELT THANKS TO ALL OUR NAVY FAMILIES FOR 
THEIR INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR READINESS, AND I URGE YOU TO TAKE THE 
TIME TO THANK YOUR SPOUSE FOR THEIR ROLE IN YOUR SUCCESS.  HONOR THEIR SERVICE 
TO THE NAVY AND THE NATION, AND LET THEM KNOW HOW MUCH THEIR SUPPORT MEANS TO 
US, NOT ONLY TODAY, BUT EVERY DAY.
