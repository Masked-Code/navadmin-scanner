SUBJ/DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH// 

RMKS/1. OCTOBER IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH. BEGINNING AS A 
DAY OF UNITY OBSERVATION IN OCTOBER 1981, THE OBSERVANCE GREW INTO THE 
FIRST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH IN OCTOBER 1987. THE OBSERVANCE 
NOT ONLY GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS, 
BUT TO INFORM SAILORS AND NAVY SPOUSES ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
PREVENTION EFFORTS AS WELL AS REPORTING OPTIONS FOR VICTIMS. 
THE THEME THIS YEAR IS, "HAVE YOU CROSSED THE LINE? END DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE BEFORE IT STARTS."

2. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CUTS ACROSS ALL AGE GROUPS AND RANKS. IT HAPPENS 
TO SAILORS AS WELL AS SPOUSES; TO MEN AS WELL AS WOMEN. THE ACT OF 
VIOLENCE CAN GO BEYOND PHYSICAL ABUSE. IT CAN BE EMOTIONAL ABUSE AS 
WELL.

3. IN ADDITION TO AWARENESS, OUR FOCUS SHOULD ALSO BE ON DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE EDUCATION AND PREVENTION. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF COURSES THAT 
TEACH HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP SKILLS AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE AT OUR FLEET 
AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS. IF YOU NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE, LICENSED 
COUNSELORS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE. THESE SERVICES ARE OPEN 
TO ALL ACTIVE DUTY AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS - EVEN SAILORS WHO ARE 
UNMARRIED CAN HAVE COUPLES COUNSELING. MUCH IS MISUNDERSTOOD ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENS WHEN A SAILOR OR SPOUSE SEEKS HELP FOR THEIR RELATIONSHIP 
BEFORE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OCCURS. MAKING AN APPOINTMENT FOR COUNSELING 
IS A SMART MOVE AND DOES NOT HARM ONES CAREER OR SECURITY CLEARANCE.  

4. IF YOU ARE IN NEED OF HELP OR KNOW OF A SHIPMATE THAT NEEDS HELP, DO 
NOT STAY SILENT AND DO NOT WAIT; PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION PROGRAMS 
ARE AVAILABLE.  
THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS IS VERY 
IMPORTANT TO US. THE NAVY IS ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO STRENGTHENING 
FAMILIES AND PREVENTING ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR.
LETS END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BEFORE IT STARTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
AND RESOURCES ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION, EDUCATION, AND AWARENESS, 
THE NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOTLINE IS AVAILABLE AT 1-800-799-SAFE 
OR ON THE WEB AT HTTP://WWW.NDVH.ORG/.
