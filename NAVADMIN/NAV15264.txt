SUBJ/USMC BIRTHDAY MESSAGE//

Rmks/1.  Happy Birthday, Marines!

2.  Each year, on November 10th, we celebrate a naval heritage that predates 
even the birth of our Nation.

3.  From New Providence to the battlefield against ISIS, Navy Sailors have 
fought alongside Marines in every "clime and place."

4.  Marines and Sailors have served together "in the air, on land, and sea" 
from the shores of Tripoli, to the islands of the Pacific, and more recently 
in the skies and on the streets of Fallujah, Marjah, and Sangin.  Today, we 
operate together in Amphibious Readiness Groups, Marine Expeditionary Units, 
and Carrier Air Wings providing a forward naval presence with crisis 
response, humanitarian assistance, and combat capabilities.

5.  This year, I look forward to strengthening the bonds of our relationship 
with the Marine Corps and improving our effectiveness in Naval Warfare.  We 
will enhance the safety and security of our Nation by providing a resilient 
two-fisted fighting organization that is forward, expeditionary, and ready.

6.  We need look no further than the Marine Corps War Memorial for the 
definitive representation of our Navy-Marine Corps warfighting team.  The 
bronze portrayal of Pharmacist's Mate John Bradley standing alongside his 
Marine shipmates atop Mount Suribachi, raising our Nation's colors, 
symbolizes our bond.

7.  From the Leathernecks in the first two battalions, to the Devil Dogs on 
watch around the globe tonight, Bravo Zulu to my Marine shipmates!  Semper 
Fidelis and Happy 240th Birthday.

8.  Released by ADM J. M. Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations.//
