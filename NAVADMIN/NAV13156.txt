RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance for the conduct of the Navy Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) stand-down.  It is critical for 
commanders to ensure their commands focus the attention and efforts of their 
personnel on this training.

2.  In ref A, the Secretary of Defense directed the military services conduct 
a SAPR stand-down for service members and civilian employees to be completed 
no later than 1 July 2013.  Reserve component units will commence their stand-
down activities commensurate with the active component and be complete by 22 
July 2013.  

3.  During the stand-down, the command triad (Commanding Officer, Executive 
Officer, and Command Master Chief) will lead a two-hour session that includes 
focused facilitated engagement on SAPR principles and emphasizes the 
importance of fostering a climate of dignity and respect.  This complies with 
SECNAV guidance in ref B as approved in ref C.  Civilian employees are invited 
to participate in the leadership sessions alongside their military co-workers.  
Stakeholders such as the local Sexual Assault Resource Center (SARC), Sexual 
Assault Prevention Response-Victim Advocate (SAPR-VA), Judge Advocate General 
(JAG), and Chaplain are encouraged to participate to the maximum extent 
possible. 

4.  In addition to conducting the leader engagement described in paragraph 3, 
there are a series of specific requirements to be completed during this stand-
down.  Chief of Naval Personnel will provide details on mandated activities, 
resources available to facilitate the stand-down, and detailed reporting 
requirements via NAVADMIN by 0001Z Thursday 6 June 2013.  Guidance will also 
be posted at Navy's SAPR website, http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/support/sapr/Pages/default.aspx by Friday 7 June 2013.     
5.  The intent of this stand-down is to ensure service members and civilian 
personnel clearly understand SAPR principles and resources available.  
Personnel should understand their accountability and role in eliminating 
sexual assault, fostering a command climate of dignity and respect, and 
upholding our core values of honor, courage, and commitment.  This effort 
builds upon training completed under SAPR-Fleet and SAPR-Leadership training 
modules.
