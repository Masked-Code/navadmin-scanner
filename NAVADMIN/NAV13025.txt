RMKS/1.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS NAVADMIN IS TO DIRECT NAVY-WIDE ASHORE USE OF 
DEFENSE CONNECT ON-LINE (DCO) AS THE STANDARD COLLABORATION TOOL FOR CHAT AND 
WEB CONFERENCING.  THIS POLICY ENHANCES OUR NAVY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) 
ENTERPRISE EFFICIENCY.  DCO IS THE SINGLE DESIGNATED AND APPROVED ENTERPRISE 
TOOL FOR NON-SECURE INTERNET PROTOCOL ROUTER NETWORK (NIPRNET) AND SECURE 
INTERNET PROTOCOL ROUTER NETWORK (SIPRNET) WEB-BASED CONFERENCING, INSTANT 
MESSAGING, WHITEBOARDING, AND APPLICATION SHARING.  DCO IS THE SOLE NAVY-
APPROVED APPLICATION TO PROVIDE COLLABORATION FUNCTIONS BY NAVY FUNCTIONAL 
AREA MANAGERS (FAM).

2.  THE DCO (JABBER) CHAT FEATURE PROVIDES USERS WITH INSTANT MESSAGING (IM) 
AND MULTI-USER TEXT CONFERENCING CAPABILITIES.
THIS TOOL GIVES USERS REAL-TIME, LOW BANDWIDTH COLLABORATION.
THE ADVANTAGES TO USE OF THIS TOOL IS THAT IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE EMAIL 
COMMUNICATIONS AND PREVENT OVERSIZED INBOX STORAGE, THEREBY ENHANCING MISSION 
EFFECTIVENESS.

3.  ACTION:  FOR ECHELON II COMMAND INFORMATION OFFICERS (CIO):
A.  IMPLEMENT THIS POLICY.  DIRECT ALL USERS WITH ONLINE COLLABORATION 
RESPONSIBILITIES TO OBTAIN DCO ACCOUNTS AND MAXIMIZE USE OF DCO CAPABILITIES.  
NOTE:  USERS MUST HAVE A COMMON ACCESS CARD (CAC) IN ORDER TO REGISTER FOR A 
DCO ACCOUNT.
B.  DIRECT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DCO (JABBER) CHAT AS THE PRIMARY MEANS OF 
ASHORE IM/TEXT MESSAGING.  THIS ACTION IS REQUIRED WITHIN 120 DAYS OF RELEASE 
OF THIS NAVADMIN.
C.  IF YOUR UNIT IS UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH THIS DIRECTIVE, SUBMIT A WAIVER 
REQUEST FOR ALTERNATE COLLABORATION TOOLS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY DEPUTY 
CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER - NAVY (DDCIO(N)) VIA E-MAIL TO 
GOVERNANCE(AT)NAVY.MIL.  ANY REQUESTS FOR WAIVERS MUST INCLUDE STRONG 
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE WAIVER, AN OPERATIONAL IMPACT STATEMENT, AND ANTICIPATED 
LENGTH OF USE OF THE PROPOSED
(NON-COMPLIANT) COLLABORATION TOOL.

ACCOUNT REGISTRATION AND RESOURCES COVERING THE RANGE OF DCO CAPABILITIES, 
INCLUDING DCO (JABBER) CHAT.  OTHER HELPFUL REFERENCE MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE
