SUBJ/SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES APRIL AS SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH 
(SAAM); THIS NATIONAL FOCUS PROVIDES NAVY THE IDEAL OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON 
EXISTING MOMENTUM IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT.  SINCE LAST YEAR'S 
HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL SAAM WE HAVE BEEN GROWING OUR "SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION AND 
RESPONSE (SAPR)-TAKE THE HELM" TRAINING.  WE COMPLETED SAPR-LEADERSHIP 
TRAINING AND ARE WINDING UP OUR SAPR-FLEET TRAINING THIS MONTH.  BOTH 
INITIATIVES HAVE FOCUSED OUR COLLECTIVE EFFORT TO ELIMINATE SEXUAL ASSAULT 
FROM OUR RANKS AND MAKE IT AN ALL HANDS RESPONSIBILITY.  THE SAAM 2013 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MESSAGE OF "WE OWN IT...WE'LL SOLVE IT...TOGETHER" IS 
SPOT ON.  WE WILL LEVERAGE SAAM AS A VEHICLE TO EMPHASIZE OUR ONGOING 
COMMITMENT TO INSTILL A CLIMATE THAT DOES NOT TOLERATE, CONDONE, OR IGNORE 
SEXIST BEHAVIOR, SEXUAL HARASSMENT, OR SEXUAL ASSAULT.  WE MUST HAVE COURAGE 
TO OWN IT, SOLVE IT, AND MOVE FORWARD.

2.  NAVY'S FY-13 SAPR THEME OF "COURAGE", ECHOED THROUGHOUT THE TAKE THE HELM 
SERIES HAS BEEN USED TO DEVELOP THIS YEAR'S FIVE COMPLEMENTARY SUB-THEMES, ONE 
FOR EACH WEEK OF NAVY'S SAAM EFFORT:
"COURAGE TO...
    A.  WEEK OF APRIL 01 - LEARN."
    B.  WEEK OF APRIL 08 - PREVENT."
    C.  WEEK OF APRIL 15 - INTERVENE."
    D.  WEEK OF APRIL 22 - SUPPORT."
    E.  WEEK OF APRIL 29 - COMMIT."

3.  ALL COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO INTEGRATE THE SHORT KEY LEADER VIDEOS INTO 
THEIR MONTHLY TRAINING PLANS AND TO UTILIZE TURN-KEY PRODUCTS ON THE SAPR 
WEBSITE FOR PLANNING OTHER UNIT ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS.  COMMANDERS ARE ALSO 
ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN LOCAL SAAM EVENTS WHICH MAY BE SPONSORED BY THE 
BASE OR AREA SEXUAL ASSAULT RESPONSE COORDINATOR (SARC).

4.  TO FACILITATE DELIVERY OF SAAM MESSAGING AND EVENTS, TURN-KEY PRODUCTS ARE 
LOCATED ON THE NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND SAPR WEBSITE AT:
HTTP://WWW.SAPR.NAVY.MIL.  A COLLECTION OF MATERIALS, INCLUDING  GUIDED 
DISCUSSION SCRIPTS, LEADERSHIP VIDEOS, EVENT PLANNING MATERIALS, AND POD/POW 
NOTES WILL AID YOUR COMMAND IN EXECUTING SAAM ACTIVITIES.  INCLUDED WITH THE 
POSTED COMPILATION OF POTENTIAL SAAM ACTIVITIES THIS YEAR ARE CORRESPONDING 
"SAAM POINTS" TO EACH ACTIVITY.  COMMANDS MAY FIND THESE TO BE A USEFUL POINT 
SYSTEM AND A MEANS OF GAUGING UNIT SAAM EFFORTS AND ACTIVITIES OR TO PROMOTE 
INTRA-COMMAND COMPETITION FOR ACCUMULATING THE MOST SAAM POINTS.  THE WEBSITE 
WILL BE UPDATED REGULARLY AND SHOULD BE CHECKED FREQUENTLY TO ENSURE YOUR 
COMMAND HAS VISIBILITY OF THE LATEST SAAM PRODUCTS.

5.  NAVY COMPLETES SAPR-F TRAINING IN MARCH; FOCUS IN APRIL IS PLACING THIS 
TRAINING INTO ACTION AND COMMANDERS TAKING CLEAR RESPONSIBILITY TO PREVENT AND 
EVENTUALLY ELIMINATE SEXUAL ASSAULT FROM OUR RANKS.

6.  SEXUAL ASSAULT IS A NAVY PROBLEM, AND SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION MUST 
BECOME A NAVY SOLUTION.  LET'S USE SAAM TO UNDERSCORE NAVY'S COMMITMENT TO 
SUPPORTING VICTIMS, REINFORCING THE IMPORTANCE OF BYSTANDER INTERVENTION, AND 
DEMONSTRATING OUR COURAGE AS SHIPMATES TO "TAKE THE HELM."
