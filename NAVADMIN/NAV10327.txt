SUBJ/NAVY BIRTHDAY 2010//

RMKS/1.  ON 13 OCTOBER, AS THE NAVY CELEBRATES 235 YEARS OF SERVICE TO OUR 
NATION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REFLECT ON OUR VITAL WORK AND HOW, THROUGH OUR 
SEAPOWER, WE PROTECT OUR WAY OF LIFE AND PROVIDE FOR THE SECURITY AND 
PROSPERITY OF OUR NATION.

2.  THE MEN AND WOMEN OF AMERICA'S NAVY ARE THE HEIRS OF A PROUD LEGACY.  
SINCE OUR NATION'S FOUNDING, THE NAVY HAS EMBODIED THE CORE VALUES OF HONOR, 
COURAGE, AND COMMITMENT.  TIME AND AGAIN, AMERICA'S NAVY HAS SEIZED 
OPPORTUNITIES IN TIMES OF CHALLENGE AND RISEN TO GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS IN PEACE 
AND WAR.  OUR RICH HERITAGE WAS BUILT UPON THE DARING, VERSATILITY AND 
CAPABILITY OF AMERICA'S SAILORS.
TODAY, THOSE VALUES AND ATTRIBUTES REMAIN OUR TOUCHSTONES AND ENSURE WE REMAIN 
THE MOST POWERFUL AND INFLUENTIAL NAVY EVER TO SAIL THE WORLD'S OCEANS.  YOU 
MAKE THE SUCCESS OF TODAY'S NAVY POSSIBLE AND YOU MAKE OUR NAVY AN 
INDISPENSABLE GLOBAL FORCE FOR GOOD.

3.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY SHIPMATES.  I THANK ALL OF OUR SAILORS, NAVY CIVILIANS, AND 
FAMILIES FOR YOUR SERVICE.  ON OUR NAVY BIRTHDAY, LET US MAKE SURE TO REMEMBER 
OUR SHIPMATES, DEPLOYED AFLOAT AND ASHORE, CONTRIBUTING TO OUR SAFETY, 
SECURITY, AND PROSPERITY AROUND THE GLOBE.  LET US NEVER FORGET THOSE WHO HAVE 
GIVEN THEIR LIVES IN THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE FOR OUR NAVY AND OUR NATION.

4.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
