RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN directs Navy compliance with references (a) through 
(h), requiring notification to local civilian law enforcement of Military 
Protective Orders (MPO).  Notification to local civilian law enforcement 
authorities will be made via the Federal Bureau of Investigations National 
Crime Information Center (NCIC) database.  When MPOs are entered into the 
Protection Order File of NCIC, a record is created that is available to 
civilian law enforcement agencies nationwide.  MPOs will remain in NCIC for 
the duration of the order and then removed no later than the end of the month 
in which they expire.  Commands will retain MPO records within local files in 
accordance with reference (h).

2.  Per references (e), (f), and (g), military commanders have authority to 
issue an MPO when necessary to safeguard victims, quell disturbances, and 
maintain good order and discipline while victims have time to pursue a 
protection order through a civilian court or to support an existing civilian 
protection order.  Per references (c), (d), (e), and (g), all issued MPOs 
will be documented with Department of Defense Form 2873 (DD Form 2873).
    a. Per references (a) through (e), all MPOs issued by Commanding Officers
(CO) of units located on Navy installations within the U.S. and U.S.
territories will immediately be forwarded to the applicable installation 
commander and ultimately to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) 
for inclusion into NCIC.  The issuing commander has a continuing obligation 
to report any change to the MPO to the applicable installation commander.
    b.  MPOs issued by COs of shore based activities not located on a Navy 
military installation, but within the U.S. or U.S. territories, will forward 
MPOs directly to their assigned NCIS Field Office for inclusion into NCIC.
    c.  MPOs issued by COs of units underway/deployed or ashore units not 
located in the U.S. or U.S. territories will immediately be forwarded to the 
applicable installation commander and ultimately to NCIS for inclusion into 
NCIC if the MPO is active at the time of the Service Members return to the 
U.S.
or U.S. territory.

3.  Responsibilities.
   a.  Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC).  CNIC will provide all 
installation commanders located within the U.S. and U.S. territories with a 
process to submit all issued, modified, and terminated MPOs to NCIS via the 
ollowing email address, mposubmission@NCIS.NAVY.MIL.
   b.  Commander, Naval Legal Service Command (CNLSC).
      (1) CNLSC will ensure Region Legal Service Offices provide judge 
advocate support to commanders without their own servicing staff judge 
advocate throughout the MPO issuance and termination process.
      (2) CNLSC will ensure a module on the issuance of MPOs is included in 
the training curriculum for prospective commanding officers and executive 
officers, and for judge advocates and legal officers.
c.  COs.
    (1) For MPOs issued on Navy installations within the U.S. or U.S.
territories, COs will immediately forward all required information, including 
the DD Form 2873, to the applicable installation commander or their designee.  
Every issued MPO must contain an expiration date.  COs will immediately 
notify the installation commander or their designee of any changes to an 
active MPO, such as an extension or early termination.
   (2) COs of shore based activities not located on a Navy military 
installation, but within the U.S. or U.S. territories, will forward MPOs, to 
include the DD Form 2873 with expiration date, directly to their assigned 
NCIS Field Office.
   (3) COs of units underway/deployed or ashore units not located in the U.S. 
or U.S. territories will report issued MPOs if the Service Member returns to 
the U.S. or U.S. territories while the MPO is active.  Active MPOs will then 
be forwarded to the applicable installation commanding officer in accordance 
with paragraph 3d(1).
   (4) Per references (c) through (e) and (g), COs should consult a judge 
advocate prior to issuing or terminating a MPO.
