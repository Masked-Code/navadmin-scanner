PERSONNEL OF THE U.S. NAVY AND U.S. NAVY RESERVE.  REF B IS DODINST

DOD.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces immediate changes to ref (a).  The
Navy-wide Advancement Examination (NWAE) answer sheet form, NETPDTC 
1430/2 (REV 3-2013), has been updated and is now easily identified 
by its green color.  The NETPDTC 1430/2 (REV 9-2000) red answer 
sheet is hereby discontinued and shall not be used to administer 
upcoming exam cycles 220 or 093 (and beyond).  The new, green NWAE
answer sheets will be mailed with the individual command advancement
exam packages.  Ref (a) provides instructions for filling out the 
NWAE answer sheet.

2.  Per ref (b), the new NWAE answer sheet is part of a larger 
effort to eliminate the use of the Social Security Number (SSN) 
within the Navy Enlisted Advancement System (NEAS).  The SSN will be
replaced by the ten-digit Department of Defense Identification 
Number (DOD ID).  Command Educational Services Officers (ESOs) can 
access DOD ID numbers for eligible advancement candidates on NEAS 
Website (https://neasos.cnet.navy.mil/).  The DOD ID is associated 
with the Common Access Card and is assigned to each Sailor 
registered in the Defense Enrollment and Eligibility Reporting 
System.

3.  For additional information, contact Mr. Tom Updike, NETPDTC N32,
at (850)473-6132/DSN 753-6132, or via email at 
tom.updike(at)navy.mil.

4.  File this NAVADMIN with ref (a).
