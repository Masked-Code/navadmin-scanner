RMKS/1. Reference (a), NAVADMIN 139/14, directed commanding officers to take 
positive action to ensure all assigned personnel update personal 
identification and contact information via milConnect no later than 25 June 
2014, in support of implementation of Enterprise Directory Services (EDS), 
required by references (b) and (c).

2. Sailors* positive actions to comply with this direction, combined with 
similar simultaneous actions to update milConnect data throughout the U.S. 
Army, have resulted in a volume of traffic that has slowed milConnect 
response speed.

milConnect response speed, the deadline for reporting completion of 
milConnect updates is extended to 11 July 2014.

4. Reporting procedures. Commanding Officers shall report completion of 
command-wide milConnect updates to their ISIC. Echelon II Command Information 
Officers (CIOs) are directed to collect and report their own and subordinate
