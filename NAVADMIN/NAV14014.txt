Remarks/1.  This NAVADMIN establishes the concept of deployability assessment 
as it pertains to the Limited Duty (LIMDU) Program.  

2.  In order to assess a Sailor's readiness, three key pieces of information 
Navy leadership must know are assignability, distributability, and 
deployability of our Sailors.  

3.  The Naval Audit Service recently completed a review of the LIMDU 
population and concluded a significant portion of the active-duty service 
members on shore with limiting medical conditions are not being accurately 
assigned to a medically restricted status.  

4.  Improvements to the LIMDU program to better assess a Sailor's 
deployability will be identified in a new OPNAVINST 1300 series.  This 
instruction will detail the processes of identifying medical limitations as 
well as administrative limitations for deployability.  This process will be 
implemented over the next two years.

5.  Accordingly, a new branch entitled the Deployability Assessment Office, 
PERS-454, was established within PERS-4 to consolidate Navy Personnel Command 
administration of medically restricted personnel.  Any LIMDU correspondence 
previously submitted to PERS-82 must now be submitted to PERS-454.
6.  All commands shall:
    a.  Thoroughly review refs (a) through (g). 
    b.  Ensure personnel assigned to their units are "medically ready" for 
deployment as stated in ref (b).  Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) consists 
of six elements:  Periodic Health Assessment (PHA) and readiness labs, dental 
readiness, medical equipment, deployment limiting conditions, post deployment 
health assessments, and immunizations.  IMR is updated via the Medical 
Readiness Reporting System.  
    c.  Designate a Deployability Coordinator (E-6 or above) in writing, and 
provide the designation letter to the supporting Military Treatment 
Facilities (MTF) deployability coordinator.

7.  All Personnel Support Detachments (PSD), Customer Services Desks, MTFs 
and clinics shall provide the deployability coordinator's (previously 
identified as LIMDU coordinator) contact information to PERS-454 by 28 
February 2014.  This information shall include at a minimum the command name, 
rank/rate, name, phone number, and e-mail address.  

8.  U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) shall collaborate with 
PERS-454 to develop Fleet-wide training objectives for the deployability 
assessment program by 21 February 2014.

9.  MTFs shall:
    a.  Ensure that the deployability of each Sailor is assessed at each 
health care encounter and a minimum of three times annually when completing 
the PHA and Performance Activity Risk Factor Questionnaires (PARFQ).  The 
disposition of Sailors should be appropriately categorized as:  no duty 
restrictions, light duty, LIMDU, etc, at each health care encounter.  
    b.  Enter all LIMDU cases into the Medical Board Online Tracking System 
(MEDBOLTS) or any subsequent system which replaces MEDBOLTS and enter all 
Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) cases into the Veteran's 
Tracking Application (VTA) for tracking purposes.
    c.  Evaluate LIMDU Sailors at a minimum every two months as stated in ref 
(b).  At each patient visit, a Sailor's disposition should be re-assessed for 
the continued need for LIMDU status.
    d.  Ensure monthly coordination/training LIMDU meetings are conducted for 
command and PSD Deployability Coordinators.  Beginning 1 March 2014, MTF 
Deployability Coordinators shall conduct these meetings in accordance with 
ref (g) and resolve all issues pertaining to delays in processing LIMDU 
personnel (i.e. 30 day re-evaluation prior to LIMDU end date, PRD adjustments 
to Transit Monitoring Unit (TMU)).  Attendance of all MTF/PSD/Command 
Deployability Coordinators at these meeting is mandatory.

10.  Points of contact:

11.  Unless specifically changed by this NAVADMIN, all other LIMDU program 
policies remain in effect.  Where a specific instruction conflicts with this 
NAVADMIN, this NAVADMIN takes precedence.  This NAVADMIN will remain in 
effect until the revision of ref (g) and implementation of OPNAVINST 1300 
(series).
