RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the launch of the Navy Esports Team by 
Commander, Navy Recruiting Command (CNRC).  The Navy Esports Team will add to 
the multi-faceted outreach campaign of CNRC by engaging with prospective 
Sailors online and at gaming venues.  Centennials are moving into digital 
spaces for most of their content consumption and social interactions, and the 
Esports domain is one of the most popular and vibrant online arenas to date.  
Connecting with future Sailors requires the Navy to be in the same spaces 
where those future Sailors reside.

2.  The qualifications to become a team member are identical to the 
qualifications needed for recruiting duty.  Refer to reference (a) for 
further details.

3.  Potential team member selectees will be screened for team fit and 
recruiting duty.  Upon approval, they will receive a set of 3 year orders to 
CNRC, Millington, TN.  Selected team members will receive recruiting training 
at Navy Recruiter Orientation Unit (NORU), Pensacola, FL en route to CNRC.  
The intent of NORU training will be to further develop communication skills 
and to ensure team members understand the types of information sought by 
those inquiring about service in the Navy.

4.  The team members will operate at a facility specifically designed for the 
team to practice, stream and compete.  Once the team members have checked 
into CNRC, they will develop a routine streaming cadence, encouraging 
followers and viewers to interact with the members and recruiting content.

5.  Team member applications will be accepted via a portal that will be open 
for periods identified on the site.  The next submission window is 15 March 
2020 through 1 May 2020.

6.  Additional Information
