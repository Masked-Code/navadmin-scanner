AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 7220.11G, NUCLEAR OFFICER BONUS AND INCENTIVE PAY.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces an update to the Nuclear Officer Bonus and 
Incentive Pay (NOBIP) Continuation Bonus (COBO) rates and structure.

2.  Navy leadership remains committed to retaining top-performing nuclear-
trained officers.  The following changes are effective 1 October 2020.
    a.  For nuclear-trained Submarine Officers and Surface Warfare Officers 
(SWO(N)s):
        (1) The COBO annual rate for officers with less than 12 years 
commissioned service (YCS) who commit to an initial contract of 6 or 7 years 
is raised from 35,000 to 40,000 dollars.  Initial contracts of 4 or 5 years 
remain at the current COBO annual rate of 35,000 dollars.  Officers who 
renegotiate an existing initial contract will receive the higher 40,000 
dollar rate if the time already completed under their existing contract plus 
the length of their replacement contract is at least 6 years.
        (2) The COBO annual rate for officers with less than 12 YCS who 
commit to contracts following completion of their initial contract is raised 
from 35,000 to 40,000 dollars.
        (3) The COBO annual rate for officers with 12 or more YCS is raised 
from 35,000 to 45,000 dollars.  An officer will only receive the higher rate 
of 45,000 dollars if, on the day of payment, the officer has at least 12 YCS.  
Contracts that cross the 12 YCS milestone between payments are not pro-rated.
        (4) For served or serving major commanders (MCs) and major program 
managers (MPMs) with at least 26 YCS:
            (a)  The COBO annual rate is raised from 45,000 dollars
(35,000 dollars for SWO(N)s) to 50,000 dollars for contracts of at least 2 
years that obligate officers to a post-MC or post-MPM tour or extend to the 
officers statutory retirement date.
            (b) The COBO annual rate is raised from 35,000 dollars to 45,000 
dollars for 1-year contracts.  Consecutive 1-year contracts are not 
authorized.
    b.  For nuclear-trained Engineering Duty Officers (EDO(N)s):
        (1) The COBO annual rate for officers with less than 12 YCS who 
commit to an initial contract of 6 or 7 years is raised from 30,000 to 35,000 
dollars.  Initial contracts of 4 or 5 years remain at the current COBO annual 
rate of 30,000 dollars.  Officers who renegotiate an existing initial 
contract will receive the higher
35,000 dollar rate if the time already completed under their existing 
contract plus the length of their replacement contract is at least 6 years.
        (2) The COBO annual rate for officers with less than 12 YCS who 
commit to contracts following completion of their initial contract is raised 
from 30,000 to 35,000 dollars.
        (3) The COBO annual rate for officers with 12 or more YCS is raised 
from 30,000 to 40,000 dollars.  An officer will only receive the higher rate 
of 40,000 dollars if, on the day of payment, the officer has at least 12 YCS.  
Contracts that cross the 12 YCS milestone between payments are not pro-rated.
    c.  For nuclear-trained aviators (AV(N)s), the COBO annual rate is 
increased from 30,000 dollars to 45,000 dollars.

3.  The new COBO rates in paragraph 2 replace the COBO rates of enclosure (1) 
of reference (a).  For initial contracts and renegotiated initial contracts, 
officers are obligated to complete a department head tour (Submarine 
Officers) or a principal assistant tour (SWO(N)s and EDO(N)s).  Eligible 
officers executing an existing COBO contract may renegotiate a replacement 
contract with a period that extends to, or beyond, the existing agreement and 
meets the minimum lengths prescribed in reference (a), which is normally 3 
years.  Officers will only be permitted to renegotiate their existing COBO 
contract on the upcoming anniversary date of their current contract or 
renegotiate to align their anniversary date with their commissioning date.  
Additionally, officers may only renegotiate their contract once during FY-21.  
Replacement contract templates are available via the applicable point of 
contact in paragraph 5.

4.  All other bonus and incentive pays authorized by reference (a) remain 
unchanged.

5.  Questions regarding NOBIP should be directed to Navy Personnel Command 
(PERS-42MP), at (901) 874-3934/DSN 884 (or via e-mail PERS-
42MP_desk.fct@navy.mil) for Submarine Officers or PERS-42D1, at
(901) 874-3145/DSN 884  (or via e-mail at PERS-
42D1_desk.fct@navy.mil) for nuclear-trained SWOs, EDOs and aviation officers.

6.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until reference (a) has been revised.
