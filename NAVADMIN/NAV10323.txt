SUBJ/OBSERVANCE OF NATIONAL DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT AWARENESS MONTH 2010//

RMKS/1.  OCTOBER IS NATIONAL DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT AWARENESS MONTH.
THIS YEAR'S NATIONAL AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE THEME FOR OBSERVANCE IS "TALENT 
HAS NO BOUNDARIES:  WORKFORCE DIVERSITY INCLUDES WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES."

2.  HISTORY.  IN 1945, CONGRESS ENACTED A LAW DECLARING THE FIRST WEEK IN 
OCTOBER "NATIONAL EMPLOY THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED WEEK."
IN 1962, THE WORD "PHYSICALLY" WAS REMOVED FROM THE OBSERVANCE NAME, 
RECOGNIZING THE EMPLOYMENT NEEDS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH ALL 
TYPES OF DISABILITIES.  IN 1988, CONGRESS EXPANDED THE WEEK TO A MONTH LONG 
OBSERVANCE.

3.  COMMAND RESOURCES.  ALL COMMANDS ARE TO INCREASE THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF 
DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT AND CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY DISABLED TOTAL FORCE MEMBERS 
THROUGH PROGRAMS, EXHIBITS, PUBLICATIONS, AND PARTICIPATION IN MILITARY AND 
COMMUNITY EVENTS.  A PRESENTATION IS AVAILABLE FROM THE DEFENSE EQUAL 
OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE AT 
HTTP://WWW.DEOMI.ORG/SPECIALOBSERVANCE/PRESENTATIONS.CFM?CATID=7.

LABOR'S (DOL) OFFICE OF DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT POLICY WEB SITE,

HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO NAVY SAFE HARBOR, THE NAVY'S LEAD ORGANIZATION FOR 
COORDINATING THE NON-MEDICAL CARE OF WOUNDED, ILL, AND INJURED SAILORS, COAST 
GUARDSMEN, AND THEIR FAMILIES.  SAFE HARBOR'S SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO FIT 
EACH SERVICE MEMBER'S UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS AND INCLUDE PAY AND PERSONNEL 
ISSUES, LODGING AND HOUSING ADAPTATION, TRANSPORTATION, AND LEGAL AND 
GUARDIANSHIP MATTERS.  SAFE HARBOR'S GOAL IS TO RETURN THESE SAILORS TO DUTY.  
IF CONTINUED DUTY IS NOT POSSIBLE, SAFE HARBOR WORKS COLLABORATIVELY WITH 
FEDERAL AGENCIES INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS, DOL, AND STATE 
AND LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS TO SUPPORT POST-TRANSITION TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT.

OUR PEOPLE.  A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE THAT REFLECTS THE FACE OF THE 
NATION MUST INCLUDE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.  THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE 
INDIVIDUALS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE MISSION, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT 
THEIR PARTICIPATION IN OUR NAVY TEAM.
