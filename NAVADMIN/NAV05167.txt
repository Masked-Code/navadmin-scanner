SUBJ/LOCATION SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS PILOT PROGRAM//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  ONE OF THE GOALS OF NAVY'S EMERGING HUMAN CAPITAL
STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE THE RIGHT SAILOR WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS IN THE
RIGHT PLACE.  TO ACHIEVE THIS, THE NAVY HAS IMPLEMENTED NEW PROGRAMS
AND EXPANDED EXISTING PROGRAMS TO MORE EFFECTIVELY INCENTIVIZE
SAILORS TO VOLUNTEER FOR ASSIGNMENT TO DESIGNATED LOCATIONS.
2.  THE LOCATION SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO
INCREASE VOLUNTEERISM TO DESIGNATED LOCATIONS FOR SAILORS MEETING A
SPECIFIC SET OF CRITERIA.  THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN REPLACED BY
ASSIGNMENT INCENTIVE PAY AND IS NO LONGER REQUIRED; THEREFORE IT
WILL BE TERMINATED EFFECTIVE 30 SEPTEMBER 2005.  LOCATION SELECTIVE
REENLISTMENT BONUS REQUESTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROCESSED FOR THE
REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR 2005.
