CAREFULLY REVIEWED AND THE BEST AND MOST FULLY QUALIFIED ARE

EITHER THE OUTGOING COMMUNITY OR THE GAINING COMMUNITY.
APPLICANTS WHO WERE NOT SELECTED THIS YEAR SHOULD APPLY AGAIN
WHILE SUSTAINING SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE AND BOLSTERING THEIR
RECORD FOR DESIRED COMMUNITIES.

COMMUNITY HAD A POOL OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES.  ELIGIBLE
OFFICERS NOT INITIALLY SELECTED, AND WHO DID NOT SPECIFICALLY
REQUEST NOT TO BE REVIEWED BY COMMUNITIES OTHER THAN THEIR FIRST

NOT PROMOTION SELECTEES AND WHO ARE NOT UNDER ORDERS CAN EXPECT
ASSIGNMENT TO A NEW BILLET APPROPRIATE TO THEIR NEW DESIGNATION WHEN
NOTIFIED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4).  IF AN OFFICER IS CURRENTLY UNDER
ORDERS AND TRANSFERS PRIOR TO NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4),
MEMBER MUST EXECUTE ORDERS UNDER CURRENT DESIGNATOR AND MUST COMPLETE
12 MONTHS AT THE NEW ASSIGNMENT, UNLESS A SHORTER TOUR IS PRESCRIBED
(TOURS IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR WILL BE WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE
GAINING COMMUNITY), PRIOR TO REDESIGNATION.

DEPARTMENT HEAD SCHOOL MAY NOT LATERAL TRANSFER UNTIL COMPLETION OF
