RMKS/1. Per reference (a), all United States (U.S.) Navy commands and 
activities with Navy and Marine Corps personnel will conduct an Active Duty 
Fund Drive in support of the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society (NMCRS) from
1 March to 30 April 2021.  This is an opportunity to contribute much needed 
funds for the direct benefit and support of our Shipmates and fellow Marines.

2.  NMCRS does not receive government funding and depends upon the generosity 
of Active Duty and retired Sailors and Marines and other benefactors to help 
those in need at home and around the globe.  Your contributions support 
interest-free loans and grants for Shipmates facing financial challenges due 
to the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Many of our Sailors and 
their families have endured unexpected deaths of family members and friends, 
the financial stress and anxiety of postponed orders and longer deployments, 
and the unanticipated loss of a spouses income.  To help our Navy families 
during their time of need, the NMCRS has steadfastly stood by us by providing 
over $3 million in assistance to those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

3.  During this period of continued uncertainty, NMCRS has remained adaptive, 
responsive, and agile by implementing virtual workshops and telehealth 
visits, and the creation of Rapid Response Loans of up to $1,500.  NMCRS also 
continues to provide essential budget counseling and financial education 
through their volunteers to address the financial responsibilities of 
marriage, the arrival of new family members, and car and home ownership.  
Often, the financial assistance provided by NMCRS is the lifeline that makes 
the difference for Navy and Marine Corps families and keeps our Sailors and 
Marines focused on the mission when an unforeseen financial crisis exceeds 
their ability to make ends meet.

4.  For over a century, our society has kept faith with Sailors and Marines.
The annual fund drive is your opportunity to help your brothers and sisters 
in arms. The campaign theme, "By Our Own, For Our Own," embodies our shared 
commitment to take care of our Shipmates and fellow Marines. I am grateful 
for those who have given generously in the past, and confident that, working 
together, we can achieve even more in 2021.

5.  As addressed in further detail below, Sailors and Marines are authorized 
to endorse, support and participate in membership drives and fundraising 
events as long as commands and organizations uphold the Department of the 
Navy's policy of truly voluntary giving during the Active Duty Fund Drive in 
support of the NMCRS.
    a.  Commands and organizations are reminded to review the regulations 
governing fundraising for NMCRS to determine which activities are permissible 
during the fund drive.  Per reference (a), authorized Active Duty Fund Drive 
fundraising activities in support of the NMCRS are permitted.
Commands and organizations should strive to be creative by sponsoring 
fundraising activities and awareness events that are virtual such as bingo, 
jeopardy, command-sponsored raffles, lotteries, bake sales, online auctions, 
or other similar activities.  Fundraising events must be conducted on 
Department of Defense owned or leased property; otherwise, the event loses 
its "By Our Own, For Our Own" designation and cannot be command-endorsed. 
Commands and organizations are also strongly encouraged to communicate the 
benefits of NMCRS and its programs through achieving 100 percent meaningful 
contact through virtual speeches, town halls, and videos. Limited 
appropriated fund support is permissible for kick-off events, award 
ceremonies, and other non-solicitation events to build support.
    b.  References (a) through (c) prohibit any coercive activities counter 
to the policy of truly voluntary giving, such as setting unit-level dollar 
goals or participation goals.  Any actions that do not allow, or create the 
appearance that Service Members do not have a free choice to give or not to 
give, or any actions that do not allow or create the appearance that Service 
Members do no have a free choice to publicize their gifts or keep them 
confidential are prohibited.  The following fundraising activities are also 
prohibited:  Selling civilian clothes privileges or special liberty, raffling 
government parking spaces, sponsoring casino-like games of chance, soliciting 
civilian or contractor personnel, or soliciting outside of the federal 
workplace.
    c.  Unit coordinators for the Active Duty Fund Drive in support of NMCRS 
should consult their JAG or ethics counselor for further guidance with regard 
to specific questions.

6.  The roadmap to success requires engaged leadership and management at all 
levels and early assignment of motivated fund drive coordinators and key 
people to ensure 100 percent of our Sailors and Marines are afforded the 
opportunity to learn about the NMCRS mission and the critically important 
programs and services they provide to our Sailors, Marines and their 
families.

7.  Our leaders, both Officer and Enlisted, are the best in the world, and I 
am confident that with their active support and engagement, NMCRS will remain 
positioned to continue the important work of helping our Sailors, Marines and 
their families. I encourage all who are able to consider making a 
contribution through payroll allotment, online credit card or cash to help 
our brothers and sisters in need.  In 2020, the Society provided over $23 
million in interest-free loans and grants in meeting the needs of more than 
23,000 clients.
We need to take full advantage of this annual opportunity to help our 
Shipmates and fellow Marines through the 2021 Active Duty fund drive 
campaign.
