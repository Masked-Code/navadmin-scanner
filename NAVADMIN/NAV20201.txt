RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels references (a) through (c) and announces 
updated business rules for the Professional Military Knowledge Eligibility 
Exam (PMK-EE). 
 
2.  As part of Sailor 2025 and Rating Modernization efforts, the PMK-EE 
provides greater emphasis on professional military knowledge and separates it 
from rating knowledge examinations.  PMK-EE serves as an eligibility 
requirement to take the Navy-wide advancement exam (NWAE) for advancement to 
paygrades E-4 through E-7 or if taking the NWAE for participation in the 
limited duty officer program. 
 
3.  PMK-EE completion is also required for Prior Service Reenlistment 
Eligibility Reserve candidates taking the NWAE in order to advance to the 
next-higher paygrade.  Sailors who are taking the NWAE in their current 
paygrade in order to lateral transfer or make their rate permanent in the 
current paygrade will not need to complete the PMK-EE.  Sailors who are 
competing for advancement through a program (i.e. the Meritorious Advancement 
Program) that does not require them to take the NWAE to advance must 
successfully complete PMK-EE for the next-higher paygrade prior to advancing. 
 
4.  The enlisted advancement worksheet (EAW) routing and processing requires 
additional time for Educational Services Officers to finalize advancement 
candidate worksheets, resulting in required changes to PMK-EE completion due 
dates.  Starting with cycle 248 (September 2020) for active-duty (AD) and 
full-time support (FTS) advancement candidates and (in line with reference 
(d)), cycle 108 (February 2021) for Selected Reserve (SELRES) advancement 
candidates, the following PMK-EE completion dates are required for each 
annual NWAE cycle administration: 
    a.  January AD/FTS E7 NWAE cycle  prior to 1 December of the previous 
year. 
    b.  February SELRES E-4/5/6/7 NWAE cycle  prior to 1 January of the same 
year. 
    c.  March AD/FTS E-4/5/6 NWAE cycle  prior to 1 February of the same 
year. 
    d.  August SELRES E-4/5/6 NWAE cycle  prior to 1 July of the same year. 
    e.  September AD/FTS E-4/5/6 NWAE cycle - prior to 1 August of the same 
year. 
 
5.  Sailors completing the PMK-EE, especially when using the mobile 
application, are advised to complete the following actions: 
    a.  Ensure that the completion certificate indicates a score of 80 
percent or higher, and that the completion date on the certificate meets the 
requirements stated in paragraph 4. 
    b.  Save a digital copy of the PDF completion certificate to a file on 
the mobile device or computer. 
    c.  E-mail a digital copy of the PDF completion certificate to an 
alternate location that is not on the mobile device. 
    d.  Print a paper copy of the PDF completion certificate for personal 
files. 
    e.  Store the digital and/or paper copy of the completion certificate in 
a location where it can be recovered if mobile device data is lost. 
    f.  Ensure that the completion information is recorded in the Navy 
Training Management and Planning System (NTMPS)/Electronic Training Jacket 
(Note:  Allow 4 days after submission for completion information to be 
updated in NTMPS.).  If information is not updated, the Sailor should provide 
a copy of the PMK-EE completion certificate to the chain of command.  The 
chain of command is responsible for contacting NTMPS at 
https://ntmpsweb.ncdc.navy.mil/Fltmps/ to coordinate data entry of completion 
information. 
    g.  Ensure all completion data is available at an alternate site prior to 
deleting the mobile application.  Once the mobile application is deleted from 
the Sailors mobile device the completion information stored within the 
application is also deleted and cannot be recovered or viewed by downloading 
the mobile application again. 
 
6.  If the EAW of a Sailor is not automatically populated with the required 
PMK-EE completion information, the NTMPS information can be referenced and 
entered into EAW to document individual Sailor eligibility for 
advancement.  If completion information is available in NTMPS there is no 
requirement for a Sailor to produce a paper completion certificate or for an 
electronic copy of the completion certificate to be uploaded into EAW. 
 
7.  For additional information about PMK-EE, go to the MyNavy Portal (MNP) at 
https://my.navy.mil select Career and Life Events, Advancement and Promotion 
page, then scroll down and click on the PMK-EE link.  There you can download 
PMK-EE Smart Sheet detailed supplemental guidance. 
 
8.  For questions about PMK-EE that are not answered by visiting MNP, contact 
the MyNavy Career Center Help Desk at 1-833-330-6622, or via e-mail at 
askmncc(at)navy.mil. 
 
9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
