RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN changes apprentice (E-1 - E-4) advancements into a 
time-in-service (TIS) based construct, effective 1 July 2024.
This change will better regulate advancement through E-4 in order to provide 
a solid foundation for billet based advancements (BBA) into the journeyman 
ranks (E-5 and E-6).  It also provides a more predictable and transparent 
advancement path to E-4 for all Sailors and ensures that every Sailor can be 
in a position to make a re- enlistment decision as an E-4 prior to the end of 
their initial obligated service.

2.  As a modification to reference (a), all E-1 through E-4 advancements will 
transition on 1 July 2024 to a TIS-based construct.  TIS requirements to 
advance from E-1 through E-4 will be as follows:
    a.  E-1 - E-2: 9 months TIS.
    b.  E-2 - E-3: 18 months TIS.
    c.  E-3 - E-4: 30 months TIS.

3.  Eligibility.  The only two requirements to be eligible to advance E-1 
through E-4 are to maintain a commanding officer's (CO) retention and 
promotion recommendation and meet the required TIS.
E-2 through E-4 advancements will be automatically effected by the Navy 
Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).  This NAVADMIN removes all 
other associated E-4 advancement eligibility criteria listed in references 
(a) through (d), to include the requirement to complete E-4 Professional 
Military Knowledge Eligibility Exam (PMK-
EE) for any advancement program.  E-4 time-in-rate dates for advancement 
eligibility to E-5 will be established based on advancement month to E-4.  
For Selected Reserve (SELRES) Sailors, the effective date for purposes of TIS 
is the pay entry base date.

4.  Exclusions.  This new policy does not include nuclear, advanced 
technical, and electronic field Sailors who already obligate for additional 
service in order to advance to E-4.  Those Sailors will continue to receive 
an accelerated advancement for service in those needed skill sets in line 
with reference (e).  Additionally, Sailors in the Professional Apprenticeship 
Career Track (PACT) program will continue to earn rating designations and 
advancement to E-4 in line with PACT program requirements, with a timeline 
that is similar to TIS-based advancements described above.

5.  Meritorious Advancement Program (MAP).  MAP to E-4 will remain for top-
performing Sailors that have necessary experience as an E-3.
A specified number of quotas will be made available for COs to request to 
advance those Sailors utilizing the MAP function of NSIPS.  Detailed guidance 
will be provided in advance of each MAP season.  SELRES Sailors should refer 
to the annual Reserve MAP ALNAVRESFOR messages for further guidance.

6.  Sailors reduced in rate below E-4.  In order to advance, Sailors must 
receive their CO's advancement recommendation and the member will be required 
to serve six months at their reduced paygrade and any subsequent paygrades, 
or meet required TIS gates (whichever is later).

7.  Transition.  While this new TIS-based construct does not go into effect 
until 1 July 2024, the Fall 2023 advancement cycles (260 and
113) for E-4 advancements will be adjusted to help transition the force into 
a fully TIS based system over the next year.
Specifically, calculations via the alternative final multiple score
(A-FMS) are now heavily weighted towards longer TIS, there are increased 
quotas for ratings with historically slower advancement timing, and there is 
no requirement to complete PMK-EE for E-4.  The A-FMS computations will 
replace the E-4 FMS computations in reference (f).  There will not be a 
Spring 2024 advancement  cycle for E-4 advancements due to implementation of 
the TIS based system on 1 July 2024.

8.  In order to facilitate this transition, commands are directed to finalize 
or certify all cycle E-4 enlisted advancement worksheets
(EAW) in NSIPS as "Eligible for Advancement" or "Not Eligible for 
Advancement" for the Fall 2023 advancement cycles.  The only criteria 
necessary to validate advancement eligibility for the Fall
2023 advancement cycles are required time-in-rate and current CO's 
advancement recommendation.  Commands should refrain from completing manual 
EAWs and instead rely on NSIPS to validate cycle eligibility prior to EAW 
closeout dates.  Each Sailor's Educational Services Officer (ESO) must 
certify E-4 EAWs as eligible if these two conditions are met.  EAW closeout 
dates are promulgated in the cycle NAVADMINs.

9.  This NAVADMIN represents a fundamental process change for first- term 
Sailors and guarantees advancement opportunity to E-4 for eligible Sailors 
currently in the process of deciding to "Stay Navy."  Those who do decide to 
"Stay Navy" will soon thereafter become eligible to compete for billet based 
advancements into Journeyman leadership roles within the detailing 
marketplace.

10.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect unless otherwise cancelled.
