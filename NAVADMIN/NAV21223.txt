SUBJ/UPDATE TO SENIOR OFFICER GRADUATE EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS// 
 
REF/A/DOC/SECNAV MEMO CONTINUOUS LEARNING FOR NAVAL OFFICERS/26AUG21// 
REF/B/DOC/NAVADMIN 263/18/25OCT18// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides policy changes to graduate education 
requirements for senior officers and reemphasizes requirements for those 
officers assuming major command. 
 
2.  Reference (a) removed the requirement for all future unrestricted line 
flag and general officers to have strategically-focused, in-residence masters 
degrees by 1 October 2021.  Although it is expected for officers of all ranks 
to develop themselves personally and professionally through continuous 
learning, this will not be a requirement in the near term.  Senior officer 
selection boards will continue to follow guidelines in the promotion board 
precepts, convening order and competency skills (for unrestricted line) for 
each respective board. 
 
3.  Reference (b) states that officers in year group 2015 and beyond will be 
required to graduate from an in-residence program prior to assuming major 
command.  This requirement will remain in effect.  In-residence education 
programs continue to provide the best opportunity to mature critical and/or 
strategic thinking skills necessary for Navy leaders today. 
 
4.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
