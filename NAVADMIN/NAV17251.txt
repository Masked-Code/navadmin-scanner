RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Command Managed Equal Opportunity (CMEO) 
Program Manager regional training schedule.  This is a one-time training 
initiative to provide a baseline to CMEO program managers and command 
leadership on the significant policy changes outlined in references (a) and 
(b) which were released 24 July 2017 and the Defense Equal Opportunity 
Management Institute (DEOMI) Organizational Climate Survey (DEOCS) 4.1 which 
was released 1 August 2017.  Recent Navy inspector general visits have 
identified command climate assessment completion and procedural compliance as 
systemic issues.  Where feasible, the training dates and locations have been 
aligned with existing summits and commander conferences.

2.  This dedicated training will provide:
    (a) command climate specialist (CCS) and CMEO program manager roles and 
responsibilities,
    (b) effective and timely administration of command climate assessments,
    (c) the processing of informal, anonymous and formal reports,
    (d) the role of the command resilience team, and
    (e) command climate assessment process.

3.  Participation by CCSs and CMEO program managers is mandatory. CMEO 
program managers not able to attend due to operational commitments will 
receive the refresher/follow-on training from their servicing CCS.  Time will 
be allocated for command triads to receive an update on the significant 
changes to policy.

4.  Uniform for the training is business casual for civilians and uniform of 
the day for military personnel.

5.  The dates for the CMEO program manager training are as follows:
    1-3 November 2017 - CNR Southwest (San Diego, CA)
    29-31 January 2018 - CNR Japan (Yokosuka, Japan)
