GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  EDUCATION IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A KEY FACTOR
 IN THE PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SAILORS.  NAVY
LEADERSHIP IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO ALL
ACTIVE DUTY SAILORS AS THEY PURSUE THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS DURING
OFF-DUTY HOURS THROUGH TUITION ASSISTANCE (TA), NAVY COLLEGE PROGRAM
FOR AFLOAT COLLEGE EDUCATION (NCPACE), ACADEMIC SKILLS DEVELOPMENT,
AND TESTING.
2.  EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, ALL ACTIVE DUTY SAILORS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR
100 PERCENT OF TUITION ASSISTANCE UP TO $250 PER SEMESTER HOUR (SH)
AND UP TO 16 SH PER FY (INCREASE FROM THE HISTORICAL LIMIT OF 12
SH).  SAILORS DESIRING TO TAKE MORE THAN 16 SH PER FY MUST SUBMIT A
WAIVER REQUEST.  EACH WAIVER PACKAGE WILL BE OBJECTIVELY CONSIDERED
BY A REVIEW BOARD AND EVALUATED ON ITS OWN MERITS.  HOWEVER, IN NO
CASE WILL WAIVERS BE APPROVED FOR MORE THAN THE OFFICE OF THE
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (OSD) LIMIT OF $4500 PER FY AT THE $250
SEMESTER HOUR CAP.  MORE TUITION ASSISTANCE AND WAIVER INFORMATION
MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE NAVY COLLEGE WEBSITE AT
HTTPS:/WWW.NAVYCOLLEGE.NAVY.MIL/.
3.  TA WILL REMAIN AT 16 SH THROUGHOUT FY-07, BUT NETC WILL CLOSELY
MONITOR UTILIZATION.  IF THE RATE OF OVERALL TA EXPENDITURES CREATES
A DANGER OF RUNNING OUT OF TA FUNDING PRIOR TO THE END OF FY-07,
NETC MAY IMPOSE MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND PRIORITIES TO ENSURE THAT
ACADEMIC PLANNING IS NOT DISRUPTED (SUCH AS LIMITING TA OVER 12 SH
TO COURSES TIED DIRECTLY TO DEGREE COMPLETION).
4.  WHILE TA IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF EDUCATIONAL BENEFIT FOR
SAILORS ON SHORE DUTY, SAILORS DESIRING TO CONTINUE EDUCATION WHILE
AT SEA OR IN REMOTE LOCATIONS SHOULD USE NCPACE.  NCPACE IS
AVAILABLE WITH NO CAPS TO TOTAL SH WITHIN A FY.  IN ADDITION TO
NCPACE AND TA, FREE TESTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS DANTES STANDARD SUBJECT
TESTS (DSST), COLLEGE LEVEL EXAMINATION PROGRAM (CLEP), AND
EXCELSIOR COLLEGE EXAMINATIONS ARE OFFERED THROUGH LOCAL NAVY
COLLEGE OFFICES AND NATIONAL TESTING CENTERS.  SAILORS WHO MAY NEED
COLLEGE PREPARATORY COURSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
NAVY'S ACADEMIC SKILLS PROGRAM AVAILABLE AT SEA AND ASHORE.
5.  AS ANNOUNCED IN REF A, TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR ADVANCEMENT TO SENIOR
CHIEF PETTY OFFICER FOR FY-11 SELECTION BOARD AND BEYOND, SAILORS
MUST EARN RATING RELEVANT ASSOCIATES DEGREES FROM AN ACCREDITED
INSTITUTION.  TO REVIEW THE LIST OF RATING RELEVANT DEGREE OPTIONS
FROM THE NAVY COLLEGE PROGRAM DISTANCE LEARNING PARTNERSHIPS
ACCESS SAILOR/MARINE ONLINE ACADEMIC ADVISOR VIA
HTTPS:/SMART.NAVY.MIL/SMART/WELCOME.CO OR THE SMART TRANSCRIPT QUICK
LINK ON NAVY KNOWLEDGE ONLINE AT WWW.NKO.NAVY.MIL.
6.  THE NAVY VALUES EDUCATION.  PURSUING A COLLEGE CERTIFICATE OR
DEGREE DURING OFF-DUTY TIME DEVELOPS IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS SUCH
AS TIME MANAGEMENT AND CRITICAL THINKING, AND ENHANCES COMPETENCIES
IN VERBAL, WRITTEN AND MATHEMATICAL SKILLS.  FOR THE INDIVIDUAL,
COMPLETING A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE BRINGS NOT ONLY KNOWLEDGE RELATED
TO THE ACADEMIC AREA OF EMPHASIS, BUT ALSO A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT
AND SELF-WORTH IN PREPARATION FOR ACCEPTANCE OF GREATER
RESPONSIBILITIES, TAKING ON NEW ROLES, OR ADVANCEMENT.
