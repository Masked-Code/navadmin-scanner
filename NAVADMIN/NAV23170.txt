RMKS/1.  Navys InTP identifies potential malicious insiders within the U.S. 
Navy and reports those personnel to leadership to prevent or mitigate 
activity that could be harmful to Navy personnel, resources, or information.  
InTP is a centralized Navy Program, mandated by reference (a) and focused on 
early identification and reporting of any potential malicious activity.  This 
NAVADMIN identifies critical actions to further posture the InTP to help 
every Navy command guard against such threats and to mature processes and 
readiness to stay ahead of the constantly evolving threat.  In addition to 
the InTP, this message tasks Commands to take actions to empower Navys User 
Activity Monitoring (UAM), giving the UAM access to critical information 
sources that aid in identifying Insider Threats through online communications 
activities.  We must work together to increase our chances in early 
identification of such threats to our mission.

2.  InTP has six lines of operation: (1) Navy Insider Threat (InT) policy, 
(2) UAM on Navy classified networks and systems, (3) Navy InT Analytical Hub 
operations, (4) Random Polygraph Program for Navy Privileged Users (PU), (5) 
Navy InT Strategic Engagement and Outreach Program, and (6) posturing Navy to 
meet National Insider Threat Task Force and DoD InTP standards.  Navy InTP is 
managed by OPNAV N2N6 serving as the Navy Executive Agent for Insider Threat.

3.  Insider Threat: Commanders, Directors, and Supervisors at all echelons 
must establish a culture of InT awareness and deterrence by reinforcing InT 
training and education and emphasizing Sailors and employees duties and 
responsibilities to notify appropriate leadership of suspicious behaviors or 
activities.  A single insider threat, through any number of malicious 
activities, can directly and negatively impact readiness, morale, trust, and 
credibility of the Navy within the United States and with our allies abroad.  
A malicious insider with the appropriate access can cause significant impact 
to the Fleet and the Joint force, harming our ability to accomplish our 
Nations mission.  Commanders must be watchful for the InT and ensure prompt, 
decisive action is taken when provided with evidence of a potential malicious 
insider.  At a minimum, Commanders will:
    a.  Develop command policies that support Navy InTP, as outlined in 
reference (e), and comply with National, DoD, DON, and Navy InTP policies, 
including, but not limited to, those pertaining to OPNAVINST 5510.165.  
Include procedures to report perceived InTs to the Policy POC listed above.
    b.  Designate a command InT Representative to coordinate with the Navy 
InTP.  Email the InT Representatives contact information to the Policy POC 
listed above.
    c.  Upon receipt of a Navy Insider Threat Risk Analysis (ITRA) memorandum 
from the Navy InT Hub, report to the InT Hub all mitigating actions taken 
within 30 days of initial receipt of the ITRA.
    d.  Direct all cleared employees complete InT awareness
training: DON-CIAR-1.0-NCIS Counterintelligence and Insider Threat Awareness 
and Reporting Training available in TWMS at 
https://twms.dc3n.navy.mil/login.asp.  Training must be completed 30 days of 
initial employment, entry-on-duty, or following the granting of access to 
classified information and annually thereafter.  Report completion to the 
Command InT Representative.
    e.  Report potential InT activity via the command InT Representative or 
directly to the Navy Insider Threat Hub.  InT reports of potential malicious 
insider activity can be submitted through the DON InT Reporting Portal at 
www.secnav.navy.mil/itp or by contacting the Navy InT Hub at (703) 695-7700 
or insiderthreat.fct(AT)navy.mil.
        (1) Navy Reporting Criteria and Potential Risk Indicators
(PRI) for InT are listed below.  Any activity observed under the listed 
criteria should be reported to the chain of command and to the Navy InT Hub.  
All reports made to the Navy Hub will be compliant with personally 
identifiable information (PII) handling standards per reference (f).
            Criteria 1: Serious Threats (e.g. threatening violence in the 
workplace)
            Criteria 2: Allegiances Against the United States/Terrorism (e.g. 
expressing ill-will towards the government)
            Criteria 3: Espionage/Foreign Considerations (e.g.
unreported foreign contacts or relationships)
            Criteria 4: Unusual Behavior and Signs of Excessive Stress (e.g. 
extreme changes in behavior)
            Criteria 5: Criminal, Violent, or Abusive Conduct (e.g.
involvement in criminal activity)
            Criteria 6: Financial Considerations (e.g. unexplained
affluence)
            Criteria 7: Self-Destructive Behaviors or other Behavioral 
Considerations (e.g. suicidal ideations)
            Criteria 8: Security Infractions or Violations (e.g.
willful or negligent compromise of classified data)
            Criteria 9: Misuse of Information Technology (e.g.
negligent misuse; malicious damage/destruction)
            Criteria 10: Personnel Security and Human Resources 
Considerations (e.g. absent without leave)
    f.  For Navy ashore SIPRNet and JWICS network owners and afloat units 
operating CANES:
         (1) Provide the Navy InTP access to appropriate data streams (i.e. 
audit logs, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Active Directory, 
etc.) and records to allow for effective Insider Threat Program analysis.
             (a) Provide LDAP data in .csv file format to the Navy UAM POC 
listed above.  LDAP data transfer and ingestion will occur by the eigth day 
of the first month of each quarter (8 January, 8 April, 8 July, and 8 
October).  The Navy UAM Center will maintain secure control of the data, 
ensuring only authorized personnel are permitted to review LDAP data.
             (b) LDAP data must contain:
                 1.  User Principal Name (UPN)
  2.  User DoD ID Number
                 3.  Common name
                 4.  Command
                 5.  Department
                 6.  Email address
                 7.  Supervisor
                 8.  Telephone number
                 9.  Title
         (2) Provide the Navy InTP a POC for all network owners and 
alternates, to include the Information System Security Manager
(ISSM) name, email address, and contact number.
         (3) Maintain and share situational awareness of the network 
environment with the Navy InTP to facilitate accurate identification of 
anomalous activity, for example network outage vice sabotage.
         (4) Incorporate InT mitigation requirements into planning, 
programming, readiness, and inspection decisions.
         (5) For Commands with CANES SW2/SW3 installed per reference (m), 
report ship name, CANES install date, and ship Information System Security 
Manager (ISSM) contact information to the UAM POC listed above.  Once 
received the Navy UAM Center will provide a testing schedule to validate UAM 
access.

4.  Random Counterintelligence (CI) Polygraph Program for Privileged Users 
(PU): Recent high-profile compromises highlight the need to increase the 
frequency of Random CI Polygraph Program for PUs, those with system 
administrator or similar accesses. Per reference (h) and to better respond to 
this type of threat, Commands will ensure Navy PUs with enhanced access to 
JWICS receive a CI polygraph once every two years.
    a.  InTP will manage and coordinate the Random CI Polygraph Program for 
PUs with both NCIS and the associated command.  InTP will enroll all PUs in 
DoDs continuous monitoring program and random polygraph pool to ensure 
appropriate management.
    b.  Commands that manage Navy JWICS networks and systems will provide a 
list of military, civilian, and contractor PU to the Navy InTP Polygraph POC 
listed above.  Provide an Excel spreadsheet indicating the name of the PU, 
classified systems of privileged access, job function, DoD ID number, 
command, and date of last polygraph.  Commands will maintain an inventory of 
PUs and routinely review and revalidate PU status to verify the privileges 
are commensurate with the individuals job requirements.

5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.
