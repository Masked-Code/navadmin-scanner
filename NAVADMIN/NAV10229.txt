RMKS/1.  AS WE COMMEMORATE THE 220TH BIRTHDAY OF THE UNITED STATES 
COAST GUARD ON 4 AUGUST 2010, I EXTEND MY SINCERE APPRECIATION TO ALL 
COAST GUARDSMEN WHO ARE SERVING OUR NATION AT HOME AND ABROAD, AND TO 
THEIR FAMILIES.

2.  THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY, THE COAST GUARD HAS BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART 
OF OUR NATION'S MARITIME SAFETY, SECURITY, AND PROSPERITY.  AS WE FACE 
NEW CHALLENGES, EVERY DAY THE COAST GUARD IS THERE TO LEAD AND ASSIST.  
ONCE AGAIN, THE COAST GUARD IS IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE CHALLENGES ON 
OUR GULF COAST.

3.  FROM ENSURING THE SAFETY OF OUR CITIZENS IN HOME WATERS, TO 
ENFORCING OUR NATION'S LAWS, TO MARITIME SECURITY OPERATIONS AROUND THE 
WORLD, THE COAST GUARD HAS BEEN INTEGRAL TO OUR MARITIME SECURITY FOR 
HUNDREDS OF YEARS.  YOU ARE ALWAYS READY TO PRESERVE AND SAFEGUARD THE 
INTERESTS OF OUR NATION WITH CONTINUED READINESS.
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY, I THANK YOU FOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS 
OF THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD.

4.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SHIPMATES.  WE ARE PROUD TO SERVE ALONGSIDE YOU AND 
LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD AND OUR PROMISING FUTURE 
TOGETHER.
