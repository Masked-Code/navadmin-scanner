RMKS/1.  Department of Defense Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) has 
announced the 2018 DoD CIO awards program call for nominations.  This annual 
event, now in its 18th year, recognizes individuals and teams within the DoD 
Information Technology (IT) Community for outstanding achievement in 
delivering forward-leaning, strategically impactful IT capabilities and IT 
management practices.  Awards will recognize achievement for advancing and 
actualizing the goals and objectives set forth in reference (a), the DoD IT 
Environment Way Forward strategy.  It is one of the highest honors 
acknowledging the IT community’s contributions.

2.  Nominations will be evaluated on outstanding achievement in one or more 
of the six critical areas:  relevance to CIO strategic goals; mission impact; 
innovation; improved information delivery and dissemination; management 
efficiency and effectiveness (better, faster, cheaper); magnitude of cost 
savings or avoidance; and broad user base.  Beginning in 2018, DoD CIO awards 
will also include two new and specific award categories for excellence in 
implementing electronic records management and excellence in Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) accessibility for persons with disabilities.  
These specific awards have their own nomination format and evaluation 
criteria.  One winning individual or team will be named for each special 
award.  Nominations must be completed and submitted in Microsoft Word format 
as per reference (b), the 2018 Annual DoD CIO awards guidance sheet and 
nomination template.

3.  Please submit your best achiever nominations for individual and team 
efforts to Ms. Michele Boswell, email: shirley.boswell(at)navy.mil no later 
than 1 August 2018 for processing as DoD CIO has granted the Navy an 
extension for nomination submission of 17 August 2018.
The evaluation criteria have been revised to align with today's technological 
environments and management approaches and will focus emphasis on the 
information environment mission area.  Nominations received after 1 August 
2018 will not be considered and those submitted directly to DoD CIO will be 
rejected by the DoD CIO.

4.  The DoD CIO Awards Ceremony is scheduled for 1100 EST on Thursday, 29 
November 2018, in the Pentagon Auditorium room BH650.
