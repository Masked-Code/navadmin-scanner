MEMBERS WITH APPROVED SEPARATION OR RETIREMENT DATES.

RETIRED STATUS.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN expands the deliberate path of the Navy to mitigate 
the effects of COVID-19 as announced by references (a) and (b).  Due to the 
uncertainty regarding the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to 
maintain operational, Sailor and family readiness, this NAVADMIN will help 
provide additional stability to both the Navy and our families.

2.  The Navy is accepting applications from active-duty and full- time 
support (FTS) officers in the rank of captain or below with a statutory 
retirement date between now and 1 December 2020 who desire to be retained on 
active-duty in a retired status (often referred to as retire/retain).  
Statutory retirements include retirements required by law for age, years of 
commissioned service, years of active service, or pursuant to twice failure 
of selection to the next higher grade.  The period of retention, if granted, 
would extend through 31 December 2020, or earlier if requested, and is only 
applicable to retention at the current command of the officer.
Officers granted retire/retain are not eligible for permanent change of 
station (PCS) orders.

3.  Reference (c) provides many details regarding retire/retain.
However, the limit on the authorized number of retired officers retained in 
an active status and the submission time requirements for a retire/retain 
request are relaxed.  Requests submitted per this NAVADMIN must be received 
prior to the retirement date of the officer to enable review and adjudication 
of the request before retirement, but not later than 1 July 2020.  
Interested, eligible officers are encouraged to submit applications as soon 
as practicable.

4.  Requests for retention in a retired status are submitted by the officer 
via their commanding officer to Navy Personnel Command, Officer Retirements 
Branch (PERS-835) by e-mail to pers_835_retirements(at)navy.mil.  The 
retire/retain request shall include the following information:
    a.  Retirement date of the officer and a request for a retention duration 
ending on 31 December 2020, or earlier if desired.
    b.  Justification and reason for request (cite this NAVADMIN).
    c.  E-mail address and phone number of the officer.

5.  Requests will not be approved for officers who have approved retirement 
as a result of:
    a.  Disability,
    b.  Selection for early retirement by a selective early retirement board 
(SERB), or
    c.  Secretary of the Navy direction for misconduct.

6.  Notification of approval or disapproval will be provided to officers via 
their chain of command.

7.  Questions regarding retire/retain should be referred to PERS-835 at 
pers_835_retirements(at)navy.mil.
