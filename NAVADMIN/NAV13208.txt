RMKS/1.  IAW Ref a, para 2, installations requiring an antiterrorism program 
must undergo a higher headquarters integrated vulnerability assessment every 
three years.  These assessments should be viewed as a tool to help prevent 
and/or reduce the impact of a terrorist attack and are intended to assist 
commanding officers in meeting their antiterrorism/force protection (AT/FP) 
responsibilities.  This NAVADMIN promulgates the list of installations 
scheduled to receive a CNOIVA during fiscal year 2014 (FY14).  Specific 
commands have also been selected to receive an additional Defense Critical 
Infrastructure Program (DCIP) assessment.  IAW ref b, Naval Criminal 
Investigative Service (NCIS) Security Training, Assessment and Assistance 
Teams (STAAT) will conduct the CNOIVA assessments using ref c.

3.  Background:  A CNOIVA is a vulnerability-based evaluation of an 
installation's ability to deter and/or respond to a terrorist incident.  This 
evaluation assists in addressing the consequences of terrorist acts in terms 
of the command's ability to accomplish its mission.  The vulnerability 
assessment methodology includes review of site specific characteristics, 
mission, threat analyses, security plans, procedures, threat and disaster 
response capabilities, and other specific command concerns.  During the team 
out-brief, options will be presented to the commander for consideration in 
pursuing improvements to force protection.  Additionally, the CNOIVA may be 
used by commanding officers to formulate budget submissions.  CNOIVA team 
members will interview personnel responsible for the following functional 
areas:  terrorist operations, security operations, structural engineering, 
infrastructure engineering, and operations readiness.  To prepare commands 
for their CNOIVA, the assessment team will need: 
    a.  Assignment of working space/access to the following:
        (1) LAN cable connection or DSL cable connection with Internet 
access.
        (2) Classified (Confidential) material storage for a small quantity 
of classified material, with 24-hour access. 
    b.  The following documents and records in hardcopy available upon team 
arrival:
        (1) Antiterrorism (AT) Plan 
        (2) Weapons of Mass Destruction Plans
        (3) Disaster Preparedness Plan
        (4) Previous JSIVA and CNOIVA reports
        (5) Security Department Post Order/Guard Force Orders
        (6) Security Department Standard Operating Procedures
        (7) Base map, delineating buildings and streets 
        (8) Defense Critical Infrastructure POC, if a DCIP assessment is 
scheduled 
    c.  15 passenger van for windshield tour
