RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels ref (a) and announces the renewal of Naval 
Special Warfare (NSW) Senior Enlisted and Chief Warrant Officer Critical

and stabilize the NSW force.

career.  Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) awards are not included in that

    b.  NSW CSRB contracts shall be for a minimum of two and maximum of seven 
years.  Members under CSRB contract will not submit a request for retirement 
or tender a resignation with an effective date that is prior to completion of 
the agreement.  Enlisted members must reenlist or extend their enlistment 
contract for a period of at least one year.  Qualified members may reenlist 
for six years and simultaneously sign a 12 month extension to maximize the 
seven year NSW CSRB opportunity.  Members are authorized early reenlistment 
in order to align CSRB and reenlistment contracts.  Reenlistments and 
extensions may be combined to align service dates for maximum opportunity.
    c.  HYT dates are firm and HYT waiver requests will not be considered 
during the NSW CSRB application process.  Members are not eligible for CSRB 
payments past their HYT date.

5.  Program Execution
    a.  Members should submit a request letter for NSW CSRB to the program 
manager 60 to 180 days prior to entering into a NSW CSRB contract via their 
chain of command.
    b.  Upon acceptance of a member's agreement by the program manager, the 
amount of the bonus becomes fixed and the member incurs a firm service 
obligation.
    c.  Service members will receive the bonus in a lump sum payment, 
effective from the date of contract execution.
    d.  As members transfer from the legacy CSRB program to the revised 
program outlined in this NAVADMIN, waivers regarding the two year minimum 
reenlistment will be reviewed by the program manager.
    e.  CSRB requests for personnel who are being processed for NEC removal 
or restoration will be held in abeyance pending final resolution.

6.  If operational commitments limit the ability to submit CSRB applications 
via this manner, commands should submit requests through their immediate 
superior in the chain of command, who can submit the request to the program 
manager.

7.  CSRB approval will not currently update the Defense Joint Military Pay 
System (DJMS) of the Sailor's intent to reenlist.  Until DJMS can be 
programmed to accept CSRB reenlistment payments, manual processing is 
required.  Payment should post to the member's account by the second pay 
period following the day the program manager receives notification of 
reenlistment or CWO contract.  Master Military Pay Account (MMPA) must 
reflect contract or obligated service for enlisted members and tax-free 
status (if applicable) must post to MMPA for both enlisted and CWO prior to 
final submission.

8.  The following documents are required:
    a.  60-180 days prior to contract:
        (1) Member's letter requesting a NSW CSRB contract; and
        (2) Commanding officer's endorsement letter.
    b.  Prior to payment, members must submit a copy of reenlistment contract 
and/or extension agreement with proof of tax-free status if applicable.

9.  Recoupment and Repayment Policy.  Per ref (c), a member of the uniformed 
services who enters into a written agreement with specified service 
conditions for receipt of a bonus is entitled to the full amount of the bonus 
if the member fulfills the conditions of that written agreement.  If the 
member fails to fulfill the service conditions specified in the written 
agreement for the pay, then the pay may be terminated and the member may be 
required to repay an amount equal to the unearned portion of the pay.
