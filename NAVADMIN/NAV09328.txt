149/09, REPORT OF 26 MAR 09 NAVY UNIFORM BOARD.  REF C IS NAVPERS 
15665I, U.S. NAVY UNIFORM REGS.// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES CHANGES TO THE SCHEDULED FLEET 
AVAILABILITY OF THE E1-O10 NAVY WORKING UNIFORM (NWU) AND PROVIDES 
INFORMATION ON UNIFORM COMPONENT QUALITY AND FIT.
2.  THE NWU FLEET AVAILABILITY SCHEDULE AS OUTLINED IN REFS A AND B IS 
REVISED AS FOLLOWS:  NWU COMPONENTS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE AND 
ORDERING AT UNIFORM CENTERS LOCATED AT NAVY EXCHANGE REGION SOUTHWEST 
AND NORTHWEST COMMENCING 16 NOVEMBER 2009; AT NAVY EXCHANGE REGIONS 
NATIONAL CAPITAL AND HAWAII COMMENCING 30 NOVEMBER 2009; AND AT NAVY 
EXCHANGE REGIONS EUROPE, JAPAN AND GUAM COMMENCING 15 MARCH 2010.  
3.  NAVY EXCHANGE SERVICE COMMAND (NEXCOM) CONTINUES TO TRACK NWU 
COMPONENT QUALITY CONCERNS REGARDING LOOSE BUTTONS AND BOOT DISCOMFORT.  
THESE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY REVIEWED AND ADDRESSED BY THE NAVY 
CLOTHING AND TEXTILE RESEARCH FACILITY.  
    A.  LIMITED EARLY PRODUCTION RUNS OF SHIRTS AND TROUSERS WERE FOUND 
TO HAVE INSUFFICIENT BUTTON STITCHING.  THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN 
CORRECTED BY THE UNIFORM MANUFACTURERS.  BUTTON REPLACEMENT IS 
AVAILABLE AT NAVY EXCHANGE UNIFORM SHOPS AT NO COST.  UPON REQUEST, THE 
NAVY EXCHANGE POINT OF CONTACT LISTED BELOW WILL FACILITATE THE 
PROVISION OF REPLACEMENT BUTTONS TO DEPLOYED COMMANDS.  
    B.  BOOT DISCOMFORT HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO 
WEARING INCORRECTLY SIZED BOOTS.  MANUFACTURERS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING 
FIT CLINICS AT ROLLOUT LOCATIONS TO HELP ENSURE CORRECT CHOICE OF BOOT 
SIZE AND PROPER FIT.  SAILORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO TRY BOOTS ON PRIOR TO 
PURCHASE.  SAILORS SUSPECTING THEY HAVE DEFECTIVE OR IMPROPERLY FITTED 
BOOTS CAN RETURN THEM TO THEIR CLOSEST NAVY EXCHANGE UNIFORM SHOP FOR 
REPLACEMENT.
4.  THE ACCELERATION OF THE NWU ROLLOUT IS THE RESULT OF SUFFICIENT 
INVENTORY QUANTITIES OF THE MOST COMMON DEMAND SIZE COMPONENTS.  IN 
KEEPING WITH THE PLAN TO ENSURE ALL SAILORS ARE AFFORDED THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE CORRECT FITTING UNIFORM COMPONENTS, THE 
MANDATORY WEAR DATE FOR THE NWU WILL REMAIN DECEMBER 2010. 
5.  FILE THIS NAVADMIN UNTIL CHANGES ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE 
QUARTERLY BUPERS DIRECTIVE CD-ROM CHANGE CONTAINING REF C.  IN THE
