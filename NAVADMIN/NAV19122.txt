RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces an advancement-to-position program for recruiters and recruit 
division commanders (RDC).  The purpose of this program is to fill priority billets via an advancement 
incentive.  Sailors selected for advancement-to-position billets will be advanced to the pay grade of E-6 
and receive pay commensurate with that pay grade upon reporting to their ultimate duty station after 
completion of their required *C* school.
Selected or *selectee* Sailors should expect to receive permanent change of station orders to report to 
an advancement-to-position billet when it is vacant.  Since all RDC billets offered under this program are 
located at Recruit Training Command (RTC) Great Lakes, an application for any single RDC billet in Career 
Management System  Interactive Detailing (CMS-ID) will be considered an application for all RDC billets.  
An applicant may be selected to fill any RDC billet advertised.  Recruiting billets will be advertised for 
specific priority Navy Recruiting District (NRD) or Navy Talent Acquisition Group (NTAG) locations.  
Applicants will only be considered for billets at the specific NRD or NTAG to which they have applied.

2.  Eligibility
    a.  All applicants must be E-5s who are in their detailing window for rotation to shore duty, have 
completed a minimum of 6 years of active service by their projected rotation date and have achieved a 
standard score of 50 or higher on the March 2019 E-6 Navy-wide advancement examination (NWAE).  
Sailors who were exempt from taking the examination due to assignment to a combat zone or 
contingency operation or who were affected by unusual circumstances covered in paragraph 615 of 
reference (a) may apply as long as they achieved a 50 or higher standard score on a previous E-6 NWAE.  
At this stage, the program is open to active component Sailors only.
Nuclear-trained Sailors will continue detailing in line with established policies between Nuclear Program 
Manager (OPNAV N133) and Enlisted Submarine and Nuclear Assignments (PERS-403) and are not 
eligible for this program.
    b.  Applicants applying for RDC billets must meet all eligibility requirements of references (b) and (c).
    c.  Applicants applying for recruiter billets must meet all eligibility requirements of references (b) and 
(d).
    d.  It is the responsibility of the member to verify eligibility.
    e.  In line with references (c) and (d), all recruiter and RDC billets require a minimum of 36 months of 
obligated service from the time the candidate completes *C* School.
    f.  E-5s selected for E-6 during the March 2019 NWAE cycle will not be considered for this program.  
However, applicants who have already been selected for E-6 may be contacted by their detailer to 
determine if they are interested in filling other open billets as recruiters or RDCs.

3.  Application.  Recruiter and RDC billets identified for the advancement-to-position program will be 
advertised via CMS-ID during the June/July 2019 application cycle.  To view all billets available for this 
program, Sailors must enter the correct Navy enlisted classification (NEC) for the position and select the 
*advance-to-
position* category in the optional input portion of the CMS-ID job search page.
    a.  To search for available RDC positions, Sailors must enter the 8RDC NEC as an optional search input 
on the CMS-ID job search page.
    b.  To search for available recruiter positions, Sailors must enter the 803R NEC as an optional search 
input on the CMS-ID job search page.

4.  Billets.  Billets identified for the advancement-to-position program will appear in the *advance-to-
position* category in CMS-ID.
This initial program will advertise 20 RDC billets and 10 recruiter billets.  Personnel with assignment 
limitations should only apply to billets to which they are eligible for assignment.
    a.  All RDC billets are located at RTC Great Lakes.
    b.  Available recruiter billets will be advertised by the NRD or NTAG they fall under, and applicants will 
only be screened for the specific NRDs or NTAGs to which they apply.  Selectees may be assigned to any 
recruiting station within the area of responsibility of the NRD or NTAG for which they are selected based 
upon the needs of the Navy.

5.  Selection.  Candidates will be selected using a modified final multiple score (FMS).  In order to 
compare candidates across multiple ratings, this FMS will include values for performance, awards, pass 
not advanced points, education and service in pay grade, but will not include the rating-dependent 
standard exam score.  The applicant for each billet who has the highest FMS from the March 2019 
advancement cycle will be selected for the program as long as they pass all special programs screening 
requirements of references (b) through (d).  Applicants are encouraged to begin completion of the 
special programs screening process as soon as possible after submitting an application for the program 
in order to preserve alternate detailing opportunities in the event they fail the screening process.

6.  Way Ahead.  Sailors can expect expansion of the advancement-to- position program in the coming 
months, both in terms of jobs and number of billets.

(833) 830-6622, via e-mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil or MyNavy Portal at https://my.navy.mil.

8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, whichever occurs first.

9.  Released by Vice Admiral J. B. Nowell, Jr, N1.//
