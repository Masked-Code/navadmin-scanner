RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides amended guidance to reference (a) for the 
timing of the 2022 E-6 periodic evaluation cycle to account for delays in the 
release of reference (b).  Selectees for advancement can expect to be 
assigned their original date of rank, which will overlap with the end of the 
traditional reporting period for E-6 periodic evaluations.  This will relieve 
administrative burdens on commands by eliminating the need to reprocess 
evaluations, accurately ensure reporting continuity for Sailors who advanced, 
and standardize reporting across Navy Active and Reserve components. 
    a.  Reporting seniors shall conduct normal E-6 periodic evaluations and 
submit E-6 periodic evaluations to Navy Personnel Command no later than 15 
December 2022 via eNavfit.  The end of the reporting period will remain on 15 
November 2022 for normal E-6 periodic evaluations. 
    b.  Sailors selected for advancement to E-7 will receive an E-6 
promotion/frocking evaluation ending on 14 November 2022.

Master Chief Christian Detje at (901) 874-3030 or via e-mail at
