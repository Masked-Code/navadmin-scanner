RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 
Navy Reserve National Command and Senior Officer (APPLY) Board on 12 August 
2024.  All Selected Reserve (SELRES) officer communities will utilize the 
APPLY Board process for command and senior officer post-command assignments. 
 
2.  Eligible officers desiring a billet assignment are required to complete 
and submit all applicable sections of the APPLY Board application.   
Applications must be submitted via the Reserve Forces Manpower Tools (RFMT) 
website available at https://rfmt.private.navyreserve.navy.mil/.  Officers 
are encouraged to place the maximum number of billet choices on their dream 
sheets to increase the opportunity for an assignment.  In addition, officers 
are highly encouraged to note their willingness to accept suggested billets 
along with any travel limitations for billets not listed on their dream 
sheets.  Doing so will enable the board to select the best qualified 
applicants. 
 
3.  All correspondence to the board must be received no later than 2359 CST, 
1 August 2024.  Correspondence received after 2359 CST on 1 August 2024 will 
not be accepted and will not be considered by the board. 
 
4.  Board correspondence can be submitted via the following method: 
    a.  Electronic Submission of Selection Board Documents (ESSBD) is the 
preferred method to submit a letter to board.  Candidates must access the 
document services application through MyNavy Portal (MNP) at  
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/overview or the 
BUPERS Online main menu.  If required, an ESSBD users guide is available on 
the MyNavy HR Selection Board Support web page.  If unable to submit an LTB 
package using ESSBD (e.g., low bandwidth, system outage, etc.), candidates 
should submit via the below alternate methods. 
    b.  Applicants may contact MyNavy Career Center to confirm receipt of 
their packages and ask questions concerning supplemental/additional 
correspondence at 833-330-MNCC/833-330-6622, 901-874-MNCC/901-874-6622 or via 
e-mail at askmncc@navy.mil. 
 
5.  A SELRES officer must be qualified as prescribed in reference (a) to be 
considered for an assignment.  A qualified officer must complete, and submit, 
a dream sheet in RFMT containing at least one billet listed on their 
application to be considered by the APPLY Board for a billet. 
 
6.  An APPLY-eligible officer who is not affiliated with the Reserve 
Component in a drilling status (e.g., Active Status Pool/Voluntary Training 
Unit, Recall, Active Duty for Operational Support, and Mobilization) is still 
required to complete and submit a dream sheet in order to participate in 
APPLY.  Non-affiliated officers, and any officers experiencing difficulty 
submitting a dream sheet within RFMT, should contact Commander, Navy Reserve 
Forces Command (COMNAVRESFORCOM) (N122) at 
usn.norfolk.comnavresforcomva.mbx.cnrfc-senior-officer-apply@us.navy.mil. 
 
7.  APPLY Board assignments are assumed to be accepted by selected officers, 
whereby no further action is required.  Officers who desire to decline 
awarded billets must do so within seven days following release of official 
results via the RFMT website. 
 
8.  Point of contact.  All APPLY Board questions or concerns should be 
addressed to COMNAVRESFORCOM (N122) APPLY Team via e-mail at 
usn.norfolk.comnavresforcomva.mbx.cnrfc-senior-officer-apply@us.navy.mil. 
 
9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
