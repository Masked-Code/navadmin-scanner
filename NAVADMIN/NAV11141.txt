SUBJ/(U) NAVY IMPLEMENTATION OF FBI EGUARDIAN SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTING 
SYSTEM//

1. PURPOSE. THIS MESSAGE PROVIDES INSTRUCTION AND GUIDANCE FOR 
IMPLEMENTING THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION'S (FBI) EGUARDIAN 
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTING (SAR) SYSTEM WITHIN THE NAVY AND IS 
INTENDED FOR NAVY COMMAND LEADERSHIP, SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 
PERSONNEL. THE NAVADMIN IS TO INFORM NAVY SENIOR INSTALLATION AND 
COMMAND LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL THAT THE EGUARDIAN SAR SYSTEM IS 
NOW OPERATIONAL, AND TO DIRECT USERS TO ESTABLISH AN ACCOUNT FOR THE
PURPOSE OF INPUTTING SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. SAR WILL PROVIDE SITUATIONAL 
AWARENESS FOR COMMAND SENIOR SECURITY PERSONNEL. THE FBI EGUARDIAN 
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTING IS SEPARATE FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF REF E,
SPECIAL INCIDENT REPORTING, WHICH IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING TIMELY 
INFORMATION ON CRITICAL SITUATIONS AND MILITARY OPERATIONS.

2. EFFECTIVE DATE AND APPLICATION. THIS MESSAGE IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY
AND APPLIES TO NAVY UNIFORMED PERSONNEL AND CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT SERVICE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS.

3. BACKGROUND. THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF 
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY IS A DON PRIORITY. REF A DESIGNATES THE FBI EGUARDIAN
SYSTEM AS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) LAW ENFORCEMENT SUSPICIOUS 
ACTIVITY REPORTING SYSTEM (SAR). THE FBI EGUARDIAN SYSTEM IS AN UNCLASSIFIED,
PASSWORD SECURE, WEB-BASED, ENCRYPTED, LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM, IMPLEMENTED 
BY DOD TO SHARE INFORMATION REGARDING POTENTIAL TERRORIST THREATS, 
TERRORIST EVENTS, AND SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY RELATED TO TERRORISM BETWEEN THE 
STATE, LOCAL, TRIBAL, AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS, AS WELL AS WITH 
STATE FUSION CENTERS AND THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS (FBI) LED JOINT
TERRORISM TASK FORCES (JTTFS). THE FBI EGUARDIAN SYSTEM IS ACCESSED VIA FBI'S
LAW ENFORCEMENT ONLINE (LEO) WEBSITE.

4. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITY.

PER REF B, INDIVIDUAL NCIS OFFICES ENSURE THAT INVESTIGATIVE LEADS ARE 
PURSUED FOR EACH SAR OCCURRING WITHIN THEIR AREA OF OPERATIONS.  
B. OPNAV N314 PROTECTION BRANCH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NAVY POLICY AND OVERSIGHT
OF PROTECTION AND COORDINATES NAVY FBI EGUARDIAN POLICY WITH NCIS.  
C. NAVAL UNITS AND INSTALLATIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCURATELY CAPTURING 
DETAILS ASSOCIATED WITH SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY AND NOTIFYING NCIS OF SUCH 
INCIDENTS.  

5. FBI EGUARDIAN INFORMATION REPORTING.   
A. NCIS WILL PROMULGATE DON STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES FOR FBI EGUARDIAN 
SAR DETAILING SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY CATEGORIES AND DESCRIPTIONS BY 1 JUNE 2011.  
FBI EGUARDIAN SARS WILL FOCUS ON OBSERVED BEHAVIORS THAT WOULD AROUSE 
SUSPICION IN A REASONABLE PERSON AND INCLUDE DETAILS REGARDING WHO 
(PERSON(S)/VEHICLE(S)), WHAT (OBSERVABLE ACTIVITY THAT ALERTED THE REPORTER), 
WHERE (LOCATION OF ACTIVITIES), WHEN (TIME, DATE, AND TIMELINE OF EVENTS).  
B. INFORMATION EXCLUDED FROM FBI EGUARDIAN FOLLOWS:
- INFORMATION BASED SOLELY ON A PERSONS ETHNICITY, RACE, RELIGION, OR THE 
EXERCISE OF FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS WILL NOT BE ENTERED INTO THE FBI EGUARDIAN

INTO THE FBI EGUARDIAN SYSTEM AND WILL BE REPORTED THROUGH EXISTING 
INTELLIGENCE 
INFORMATION REPORTS AND SYSTEMS.

REPORTED THROUGH EXISTING CLASSIFIED REPORTS AND SYSTEMS.

6. INFORMATION REVIEW.  NAVY COMMANDS WITH UNIFORMED OR CIVILIAN PERSONNEL

FUNCTIONS WILL QUICKLY REPORT SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY TO LOCAL NCIS 
REPRESENTATIVES.
LOCAL NCIS REPRESENTATIVES WILL REVIEW AND VALIDATE SAR. APPROVED SARS WILL BE 
RELEASED INTO THE FBI EGUARDIAN SYSTEM.  CLASSIFIED INFORMATION SHOULD BE 
REPORTED THROUGH EXISTING CLASSIFIED REPORTS AND SYSTEMS.

7. INFORMATION DISSEMINATION. NCIS MULTIPLE THREAT ALERT CENTER

NCIS OFFICES ENSURE FLEET, REGIONAL AND LOCAL DON COMMANDS AND OPERATION 
CENTERS REMAIN APPRISED OF THREATS EMANATING FROM SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY.  
FOR ACTIVITY OCCURRING WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, NCIS OFFICES COORDINATE 
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY INVESTIGATIONS WITH THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK 
FORCE (JTTF) AS WELL AS LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. FOR 
ACTIVITY OCCURRING OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, NCIS ENSURES AFFECTED MEMBERS 
OF THE U.S. COUNTRY TEAM ARE APPRISED AND, IF APPROPRIATE, THE INFORMATION 
IS SHARED WITH HOST NATION AUTHORITIES FOR JOINT INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS.
