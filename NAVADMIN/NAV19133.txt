RMKS/1.  Purpose.  This NAVADMIN announces the Sundown of Non -Classified 
Internet Protocol Router (NIPR) Taskers Version 5 (TV5) and provides an 
update on Department of the Navy (DON) Tasking, Records and Consolidated 
Knowledge Enterprise Repository (TRACKER) for the Office of the Chief of 
Naval Operations (OPNAV) Staff and Echelon II Commands, per reference (a).  
DON TRACKER can be accessed at https://dontracker.navy.mil.

2.  General.  OPNAV and Ech II commands officially implemented DON TRACKER as 
their task management (TM) system in May 2017, per reference (a).  The 
initial schedule called for the TV5 Sundown Phase to end on 31 December 2017.  
However, an operational pause on DON TRACKER implementation allowed commands 
to continue using TV5 while critical system upgrades were made to DON 
TRACKER.  DON TRACKER is now at a point where it can function as the single 
enterprise solution to replace multiple legacy Department-wide NIPR TM 
applications.  Therefore, all TV5 users will transition to DON TRACKER.

3.  TV5 Data Migration.  The data migration will take place in a phased 
approach.  During the first phase, archived taskers will be migrated to DON 
TRACKER.  During this time, the functions Create New Task and Re-Open 
Completed Task will be deactivated.  However, users will still be able to 
complete open taskers.  During the second phase, users will no longer be able 
to work on taskers in TV5, and all remaining closed taskers will be migrated 
to DON TRACKER.  All open taskers will need to be transferred manually before 
the migration of closed taskers.  Open taskers will not migrate to DON 
TRACKER.

4.  Schedule.  The first phase of the data migration will commence on
1 July 2019.  As of this date, users will no longer be able to create new TV5 
taskers or reopen completed taskers.  The second phase of the data migration 
will commence on or about 1 January 2020.  As of this date, users will only 
be able to access TV5 in read-only mode.  The TV5 application will officially 
sunset in Spring 2020.  All task management functions will be performed in 
DON TRACKER.

5.  Registration.  In order to register for DON TRACKER, users must visit the 
DON TRACKER website URL, enter their personal information in the registration 
box, and select the appropriate organization.
If a user is unable to identify the appropriate organization, please contact 
your DON TRACKER organizational administrator (OA), if known.
If you are unable to identify your OA, please contact CDR Enjoli Ramsey at 
(703) 693-8712.

6.  DON TRACKER Customer Support.  Customers will initiate service requests 
for technical assistance via NESD at 1-833-NESD-NOW (1-833 -637-3669).  They 
will press Option 1 and then press Option 1 again.
The e-mail address is nesd_dontracker.fct(AT)navy.mil.  TV5 customer support 
can be reached at (703) 695-9093.

7.  Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR).  The Department of the Navy (DON) 
is scheduled to transition from SIPR TV5 to SIPR DON TRACKER in early FY20.  
More information will be provided when the SIPR transition plan is finalized.

8.  Task Management Tool (TMT).  The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) 
is directing adoption of TMT as the task management tool for the Department 
of Defense. The Army recently adopted TMT as their TM solution, and DON is 
currently working with the Army on an implementation plan.  DON is currently 
scheduled to transition to the new system by FY22.

9.  Applicability.  This NAVADMIN is applicable to commands currently using 
TV5 as one of their Task Management applications.
