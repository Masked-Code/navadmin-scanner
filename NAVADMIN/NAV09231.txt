SUBJ/COAST GUARD BIRTHDAY MESSAGE// 
RMKS/1.  AS WE COMMEMORATE THE 219TH BIRTHDAY OF THE UNITED STATES 
COAST GUARD ON 4 AUGUST 2009, I EXTEND MY SINCERE APPRECIATION TO ALL 
COAST GUARDSMEN WHO ARE SERVING OUR NATION AT HOME AND ABROAD, AND TO 
THIER FAMILIES WHO SUPPORT THEM.
2.  SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 1790 AS THE REVENUE MARINE AND THE REVENUE 
CUTTER SERVICE, THE COAST GUARD HAS GROWN WITH OUR NATION.  IT IS ONE 
OF THE OLDEST ORGANIZATIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND, UNTIL THE 
NAVY DEPARTMENT WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1798, SERVED AS THE NATION'S ONLY 
MARITIME ARMED FORCE.  IN TIMES OF PEACE AND WAR, OUR COAST GUARD HAS 
SERVED ALONGSIDE US, PROVIDING FOR THE STABILITY AND PROSPERITY OF OUR 
GREAT NATION.  FROM SERVING AS THE NATION'S FRONT-LINE AGENCY FOR 
ENFORCING OUR LAWS AT SEA, TO PROTECTING THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT AND THE 
NATION'S VAST COASTLINE AND PORTS, TO SAVING LIVES AND AIDING 
DISTRESSED VESSELS AT SEA, TO FULFILLING THE MARITIME STRATEGY DAY IN 
AND DAY OUT AROUND THE GLOBE, OUR COAST GUARD PARTNERS STAND READY TO 
DEFEND AND PROTECT OUR NATION'S VITAL INTERESTS.
3.  THE COAST GUARD IS A FULL PARTNER IN THE MARITIME STRATEGY.  WITH 
THEIR CONTINUED READINESS, RESPONSIVE POSTURE, AND RELEVANT 
CAPABILITIES, COAST GUARDSMEN ALIGN WITH THE NAVY'S MISSION, ENABLING 
US TO ACHIEVE THE VISION OF OUR STRATEGY.  I GREATLY APPRECIATE THE 
MANY CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD, AND I THANK EACH 
AND EVERY ONE OF YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. 
4.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SHIPMATES.  I AM PROUD TO SERVE ALONGSIDE YOU.
5.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
