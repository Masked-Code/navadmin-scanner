RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces a change in dates and board sponsorship of 
the biannual lateral transfer and redesignation board.  These changes will 
streamline the board process and improve return on investment for the Navy by 
leveraging the specialized skill sets of officers to the Navys community 
needs.

2.  This board was held biannually in June and November with Commander, Navy 
Personnel Command, Career Progression Department
(PERS-8) serving as the board sponsor.  Effective immediately, Bureau of 
Naval Personnel, Officer Community Management Branch
(BUPERS-3) will sponsor future lateral transfer and redesignation boards and 
they will be conducted biannually in February and August.
Moving the board to August will increase the likelihood that officers receive 
promotion results prior to the August board results.  The next active duty 
officer lateral transfer and redesignation board is scheduled for February 
2019.  The February board will now occur after annual promotion planning, 
providing the optimal opportunity for officers who wish to laterally transfer 
between communities.

3.  The NAVADMIN announcing the convening and application deadline for the 
February 2019 Board will be released in the coming months.
Additional information can be found on the Navy Personnel Command
(NPC) lateral transfer and redesignation website at

npc/boards/administrative/TransferRedesignation/Pages/default.aspx.

4.  All inquiries and correspondence should be sent to:
NPC_ACTIVE_TRANSFER-REDES_SELBD.FCT(AT)NAVY.MIL.

5.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
