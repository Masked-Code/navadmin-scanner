SUBJ/OBSERVANCE OF ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH 2009//

RMKS/1.  IN MAY WE CELEBRATE THE MANY CONTRIBUTIONS OF AMERICANS OF 
ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDS DESCENT TO OUR NATION AND OUR NAVY.
THIS YEAR, WE CELEBRATE WITH THE NATIONAL THEME, "LEADERSHIP TO MEET 
THE CHALLENGES OF A CHANGING WORLD."

2.  CONGRESS PROPOSED AND PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER SIGNED A JOINT 
RESOLUTION ESTABLISHING THE FIRST 10 DAYS OF MAY AS ASIAN/PACIFIC 
AMERICAN HERITAGE WEEK IN 1978.  TWELVE YEARS LATER PRESIDENT GEORGE H. 
W. BUSH EXPANDED THE OBSERVANCE TO ENCOMPASS THE FULL MONTH OF MAY, AND 
IN 1992, MAY WAS OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED "ASIAN/PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE 
MONTH."

3.  THE TIMING OF ASIAN/PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH COINCIDES WITH 
THE ARRIVAL OF THE FIRST JAPANESE IMMIGRANTS ON 7 MAY 1843, AND THE 
COMPLETION OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD ON 10 MAY 1869, CONSTRUCTED 
LARGELY BY CHINESE IMMIGRANT WORKERS.  OUR CELEBRATION ENCOMPASSES MORE 
THAN AMERICANS OF JAPANESE AND CHINESE DESCENT; IT INCLUDES THOSE OF 
FAR EAST OR SOUTHEAST ASIA, INDIAN, AND THE PACIFIC ISLANDS OF 
MELANESIA, MICRONESIA, AND POLYNESIA AS WELL.

4.  "LEADERSHIP TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF A CHANGING WORLD," HAS BEEN 
EXEMPLIFIED BY MANY ASIAN/PACIFIC AMERICAN SAILORS THROUGHOUT OUR NAVAL 
HISTORY.  THE FOLLOWING ARE JUST A FEW OF THE MANY EXAMPLES:
A.  CHINESE AMERICAN WILLIAM AH HANG, WHO IN 1863 BECAME ONE OF THE 
FIRST ASIAN AMERICANS TO ENLIST IN THE U.S. NAVY.
B.  NAVY FIREMAN 2ND CLASS TELESFORO DE LA CRUZ TRINIDAD, A FILIPINO 
AMERICAN, WHO EARNED THE MEDAL OF HONOR FOR EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM 
RESCUING SHIPMATES FROM THE INFERNO OF A BOILER EXPLOSION ONBOARD USS 
SAN DIEGO, 21 JANUARY 1915.
C.  RADM GORDON PAI'EA CHUNG-HOON, OF MIXED CHINESE AND HAWAIIAN 
HERITAGE, RECEIVED THE NAVY CROSS AND SILVER STAR FOR CONSPICUOUS 
GALLANTRY AND EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM AS COMMANDING OFFICER OF USS 
SIGSBEE FROM MAY 1944 TO OCTOBER 1945.  ON 14 APRIL 1945, WHILE ON 
RADAR PICKET STATION OFF OKINAWA, A KAMIKAZE CRASHED INTO SIGSBEE, 
REDUCING HER STARBOARD ENGINE TO FIVE KNOTS AND KNOCKING OUT THE SHIP'S 
PORT ENGINE AND STEERING CONTROL.  DESPITE THE DAMAGE, ADMIRAL CHUNG-
HOON, THEN A COMMANDER, VALIANTLY KEPT HIS ANTI-AIRCRAFT BATTERIES 
DELIVERING PROLONGED AND EFFECTIVE FIRE AGAINST THE CONTINUOUS ENEMY 
AIR ATTACK WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY DIRECTING THE DAMAGE CONTROL EFFORTS 
THAT ALLOWED SIGSBEE TO MAKE PORT UNDER HER OWN POWER.
USS CHUNG-HOON SAILS TODAY IN HIS HONOR.
D.  ET1(SS) JOHN YOSHIKAWA KUAPAHI RECEIVED COMMENDATION FOR KNOWING 
AND WILLINGLY RISKING HIS LIFE AND POSSIBLY PREVENTING A MAJOR DISASTER 
BY HIS HEROIC EFFORTS IN FIGHTING AN ENGINE ROOM FIRE ON USS SARGO.

5.  TODAY, ABOUT 55,000 INDIVIDUALS OF ASIAN/PACIFIC ISLAND DESCENT 
SERVE IN THE NAVY'S TOTAL FORCE - ACTIVE, RESERVE, AND CIVILIAN.
