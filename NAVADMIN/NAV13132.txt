3.  Due to the constraints of the exercise timeline, personnel accountability 
(PA) reporting for this order to account will be conducted beginning 1200Z, 
20MAY13 and will continue until the personnel accountability objective for 
this exercise meets the satisfaction of USFFC and DCNO (N1).  Supporting 
commands will be available to assist during exercise hours 0800-2000 EDT 
daily, as stated in ref (d).  Commands are expected to execute PA to 100 
percent compliance within 72 hour timeline upon PA commencement.  Should a 
real world catastrophic event develop during the exercise, Hurrex/Citadel Gale 
play will be suspended to avoid confusion.

4.  All commands are expected to:
    a.  Muster and account for all affected personnel, including applicable 
family members.  Commanding officers (COS) and/or commanding officers 
representatives (CORS) are to determine accurate status and whereabouts of 
their personnel and muster and account for them at current residence, 
displaced location, or not in the GAOI with specified circumstance (deployed, 
TDY/TAD/IA, on leave, separated/retired, transferred, UA/deserter, other).  In 
doing so, an accurate accounting of all personnel in all accounting categories 
can be quickly determined.
    b.  COS and/or CORS utilize the Navy Family Accountability and Assessment 
System (NFAAS) support site at https://navyfamily.navy.mil to account for each 
individual required to be reported per refs (a) and (b).
    c.  Individuals or family members not able to contact their command can 
log on to NFAAS at https://navyfamily.navy.mil and check in (muster) on the 
Navy family members site.  If unable to log on to NFAAS, call the NFAAS help 
desk at 866-946-9183.
    d.  If NFAAS is not available, commands are to report the status of PA to 
the affected Region Operations Center (ROC) or direct chain of command.
    e.  Do not delay reporting on personnel until all information is complete.  
Report and account mustering information when obtained including the posting 
of amplifying data in the notes area on the individual's accounting line.

5.  Commands executing evacuation procedures are responsible for issuing TDY 
evacuation orders for their personnel, military and civilian employees, and 
family members using DOD Form 1610.  Military members departing the area being 
evacuated are on TDY status and will receive normal TDY allowances. Command's 
day-to-day operations funding source is to be used per ref (d).  For civilian 
employees and family members of military and civilian personnel, the funding 
accounting data is outlined in refs (e) and (f). 

6.  Displaced personnel who have been ordered to evacuate by military 
authority, can email the Navy Pay and Personnel Support Center (NPPSC), 
Norfolk, VA at evacuations(at)navy.mil for evacuation travel related 
questions. 
    a.  The decision of local civil officials to evacuate an area is not 
sufficient for DOD reimbursement entitlements.  The appropriate military 
official must authorize/order an evacuation as local civil officials cannot 
obligate the expenditure of DOD funds.
    b.  Commands will designate safe havens for evacuated personnel.
    c.  Upon arrival at the designated safe haven, all personnel muster in 
accordance with parent command direction.

7.  Navy families who were severely impacted by ZIHNA are strongly encouraged 
to log into NFAAS, https://navyfamily.navy.mil, to update contact information 
and complete a needs assessment form at their earliest convenience after storm 
passage.  For further assistance after a needs assessment form has been 
submitted, call Navy Personnel Command Emergency Coordination Center (NPC ECC) 
at 877-414-5358 or e-mail npc.cat.captain(at)navy.mil.

8.  For PA questions or concerns, contact the point of contacts below for your 
chain of command (read as location/phone/email):
