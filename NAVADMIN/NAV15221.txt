SUBJ/CNO FAREWELL MESSAGE//

RMKS/1.  As I complete my tenure as the Chief of Naval Operations, I want to 
thank you for your inspiring efforts that ensured the Navy operated where it 
mattered, when it mattered -- while laying the foundation of our future 
fleet.  You are our greatest strength and asymmetric advantage.  Families 
that support you are essential to our success.

2.  Tomorrow, I will be relieved by Admiral John Richardson, an exceptional 
leader.  You are in excellent hands.

3.  It has been an honor and privilege to serve you and serve with you, over 
the last four years.  Darleen and I send our sincere wishes for happiness, 
safety and success to you and your families.

4.  Released by Chief of Naval Operations.//
