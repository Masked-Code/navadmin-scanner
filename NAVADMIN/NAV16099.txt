SUBJ/AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD RETENTION BONUS PROGRAM//

RMKS/1.  This announces the Aviation Department Head Retention Bonus (ADHRB) 
program for the active component for all officers with a winging active-duty 
service obligation (ADSO) expiring in FY-17, as well as those whose ADSO 
expires in FY-16 but who did not sign an ADHRB contract under the FY-15 
program.  A vital part of developing a total force strategy and maintaining 
combat readiness is to provide appropriate incentives to retain skilled 
personnel for critical naval aviation enterprise billets.  The Aviation 
Career Continuation Pay (ACCP) program (of which the ADHRB is a subset) 
incentivizes talented, hard-working, career-minded Naval Aviators and Naval 
Flight Officers (NFOs) to choose to remain on active duty.  Our return on 
investment is the retention for continued Navy service of our aviation 
warfighters, with their invaluable and truly irreplaceable skill sets and 
capacity for leadership.

2.  The following bonus amounts are offered to officers with ADSO expiring in 
FY-16.  All officers agreeing to an ADHRB contract incur a five-year service 
obligation beginning at ADSO expiration or at contract approval date, 
whichever is later.  Applications for officers with ADSO expiring in FY-16 
must be received by 31 August 2016.
