(AERR).//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Advancement Examination Readiness Review 
(AERR) schedule from April 2023 through September 2023.  AERR panels provide 
an opportunity for selected rating Fleet subject matter experts (FSME) from 
Fleet and shore-based commands to impact their respective ratings by updating 
and validating the examination question banks.  Selected chief, senior chief, 
and master chief petty officers on Active Duty, Training and Administration 
of the Reserves, and Reservists currently on Active Duty for Operational 
Support may take part in the process.  AERRs enable the Navy to advance the 
most qualified and rating- knowledgeable Sailors.

2.  AERRs are held at Naval Education and Training Professional Development 
Center (NETPDC) in Pensacola, FL.  Temporary duty travel (TDY) in support of 
AERR events is considered mission critical and is flag officer approved.  All 
costs pertaining to TDY are funded by NETPDC.  All travel will be in line 
with Department of the Navy regulations at the time of the scheduled AERR.

3.  In line with reference (a), type commanders (TYCOM) and rating sponsors 
will recruit rating FSMEs, select AERR panel members plus two alternate 
members, and provide names and contact information no less than 45 days prior 
to the AERR convening date to NETPDC via e- mail at 
NETPDC_AERR_MAILBOX(at)us.navy.mil with a subject line of "AERR Selectees."
