BONUS (SRB)// REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/30JAN2007// AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 
1160.8A, SRB PROGRAM INSTRUCTION.// RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES 
REVISED SRB AWARD LEVELS FOR ACTIVE COMPONENT AND RESERVE COMPONENT 
FULL TIME SUPPORT (FTS).  THIS NAVADMIN SUPERSEDES NAVADMIN 251/07.  
INCREASED AWARD LEVELS ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND DECREASES ARE 
EFFECTIVE 30 SEPTEMBER 2008. THESE AWARD LEVELS ARE REVIEWED AND 
EVALUATED SEMI-ANNUALLY.  
2.  THE SRB PROGRAM ENHANCES NAVY'S ABILITY TO SIZE, SHAPE AND 
STABILIZE THE FORCE BY USING A MONETARY INCENTIVE TO ENCOURAGE SAILORS 
WITH CRITICAL SKILLS AND VALUABLE EXPERIENCE TO STAY NAVY.  SRB IS A 
MARKET-BASED INCENTIVE ALLOWING ENLISTED COMMUNITY MANAGERS TO 
STRATEGICALLY ADJUST AWARD LEVELS AS RETENTION NEEDS DICTATE, WHILE 
STEWARDING FISCAL RESOURCES IN TIME OF WAR.  
3.  THE FOLLOWING GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED ON NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION 
(NEC) SPECIFIC SRB AND LATERAL CONVERSIONS. 
ACCEPTANCE OF A NEC-SPECIFIC SRB CONTRACT INDICATES AN AGREEMENT 
BETWEEN THE SAILOR AND THE NAVY TO UTILIZE THE SKILLS ATTRIBUTED TO THE 
NEC DURING THE SAILOR'S ENLISTMENT TO MEET FLEET READINESS REQUIREMENTS.  
IN SUBSEQUENT TOURS, A SAILOR MUST BE WILLING TO BE DETAILED DURING THE 
NORMAL PROJECTED ROTATION DATE WINDOW TO A BILLET AVAILABLE WITHIN THE 
SRB CONTRACTED NEC, CONSISTENT WITH SEA-SHORE FLOW REQUIREMENTS.  
LATERAL CONVERSIONS MUST FOLLOW REF A, PARA 12.D.  LATERAL CONVERSION 
REQUESTS WILL NOT BE PROCESSED MORE THAN NINE MONTHS BEFORE THE 
EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE (EAOS).  CONVERSIONS TO A RATE 
WITH A LOWER AWARD LEVEL WILL NORMALLY NOT BE APPROVED.
4.  INFORMATION ON INCREASED AND DECREASED AWARD LEVELS. 
    A.  AN ELIGIBLE SAILOR WITH A NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (NPC) APPROVED 
SRB REQUEST WHO HAS NOT YET REENLISTED OR EXECUTED AN SRB QUALIFYING 
EXTENSION, AND WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM A HIGHER AWARD LEVEL UNDER THIS 
PLAN, WILL BE RE-APPROVED USING THE NEW AWARD LEVEL. SAILORS SHOULD 
ALLOW AT LEAST ONE FULL WORKING DAY FOR THE REPROGRAMMING OF THE 
OFFICER PERSONNEL INFORMATION SYSTEM (OPINS) WITH THE NEW AWARD LEVELS.  
ONCE OPINS IS REPROGRAMMED, THE AFFECTED APPROVALS WILL BE UPDATED BY 
PERS-811 AND NEW APPROVAL MESSAGES WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO THE SAILOR'S 
COMMAND.  ALLOW THREE WORKING DAYS FOR THESE NEW MESSAGES TO REACH 
COMMANDS PRIOR TO CONTACTING THE SRB DESK. 
    B.  A SAILOR IN A SKILL LISTED FOR REDUCTION OR TERMINATION OF 
AWARD LEVEL WHO HAS AN APPROVAL MESSAGE OR A PENDING PRECERTIFICATION 
(PRECERT) FOR A REENLISTMENT DATE AFTER 30 SEPTEMBER 2008 MUST RESUBMIT 
A REQUEST FOR A NEW REENLISTMENT DATE PRIOR TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2008 TO BE 
ELIGIBLE FOR THE HIGHER AWARD LEVEL.  THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS TO THIS ARE 
OUTLINED IN REF A, PARA 12.A.
5.  PERFORM-TO-SERVE (PTS) REQUIREMENTS.  AN SRB REQUEST FOR A SAILOR 
WHO REQUIRES PTS APPROVAL MUST BE SUBMITTED AFTER THE SAILOR HAS BEEN 
OFFICIALLY NOTIFIED OF PTS APPROVAL.  THE STATUS OF PTS APPROVAL MAY BE 
VIEWED THROUGH OPINS IN THE ESTIMATED DATE OF LOSS TO NAVY (EDLN) FIELD 
OF THE I31 SCREEN.
6.  REENLISTMENT PROCEDURES.  SAILORS MAY REQUEST TO REENLIST FOR SRB 
AT ANY TIME WITHIN THE SAME FISCAL YEAR AS THEIR EAOS, SEE REF A, PARA 
12 FOR EXCEPTIONS.  OTHER POLICIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES IN REF 
A AND THE DEFENSE JOINT MILITARY PAY SYSTEM (DJMS) PROCEDURES TRAINING 
GUIDE REMAIN IN EFFECT.  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT SAILORS REENLIST AS 
CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THEIR EAOS TO PRESERVE THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF THEIR 
SRB PAYMENT.  BECAUSE SRB IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF MONTHS 
FOR WHICH A SAILOR REENLISTS BEYOND HIS OR HER CURRENT EAOS, 
REENLISTING EARLY REDUCES THE SRB PAYMENT.
7.  OBLIGATE SERVICE TO TRAIN (OTT) AND THEN REENLIST.  SEE REF (A), 
PARA 12.E. FOR OTT GUIDANCE.  REQUESTS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED TO
PERS-811 VIA NAVPERS 1306/7, ENLISTED PERSONNEL ACTION REQUEST.  A COPY 
OF THE AUTHORIZATION SHOULD BE RETAINED IN THE FIELD SERVICE JACKET 
UNTIL THE SRB REENLISTMENT ON GRADUATION DAY FROM THE COURSE OF 
INSTRUCTION.
8.  COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES.
    A.  COMMANDS MUST SUBMIT SRB REQUESTS VIA OPINS 35-120 DAYS IN 
ADVANCE OF THE SAILORS EAOS OR REENLISTMENT DATE TO ENSURE THE APPROVAL 
OR DISAPPROVAL MESSAGE WILL REACH THE SAILOR'S COMMAND AND THE DEFENSE 
FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING SERVICE BEFORE THE REENLISTMENT DATE. TIMELINESS 
IS CRITICAL BECAUSE THE APPROVED PRECERT NOTIFIES THE DJMS OF THE 
SAILORS INTENT TO REENLIST, PREVENTS INTERRUPTION OF PAY, AND ENSURES 
THE INITIAL SRB PAYMENT POSTS TO THE SAILOR'S ACCOUNT.  ANY CHANGES TO 
THE APPROVAL MAY CAUSE ERRORS AND SLOW PAYMENTS.  AS A RESULT,CHANGES 
SHOULD BE PREVENTED.  SAILORS MUST HAVE APPROVED PRECERTS BEFORE 
REENLISTING, THOUGH THEY MAY WAIT UNTIL THEIR EAOS TO REENLIST.  THE 
SERVICING PERSONNEL OFFICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING THE 
REENLISTMENT, POSTING THE CONTRACT AND RELEASING THE FIRST PAYMENT.
    B.  COMMANDS INITIATING SRB PRECERTS MUST ENSURE ALL OF THE DATA 
INCLUDED IN THE PRECERT REQUEST IS CORRECT AND THE SAILOR IS ELIGIBLE 
TO REENLIST FOR THE REQUESTED SRB.
    C.  A SAILOR WITH AN APPROVED PRECERT WHO DOES NOT REENLIST ON THE 
DATE OR FOR THE TERM SPECIFIED ON THE PRECERT MESSAGE MUST HAVE HIS OR 
HER COMMAND CONTACT PERS-811D TO INITIATE A REENLISTMENT CANCELLATION 
TO AVOID PLACING THE SAILOR IN AN OVERPAID STATUS.
9.  CANCELLATION OF INOPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  ANY SAILOR MAY CANCEL UP 
TO 24 MONTHS OF AN INOPERATIVE EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT PROVIDED:
    A.  CANCELLATION OF THE EXTENSION IS AUTHORIZED BY PERS-811 BEFORE 
IT BECOMES OPERATIVE.
    B.  THE SAILOR IMMEDIATELY REENLISTS FOR AT LEAST 24 MONTHS BEYOND 
THE EXTENDED EAOS, DAY-FOR-DAY.  ALL INOPERATIVE EXTENSIONS NOT 
CANCELLED BY PERS-811 WILL COUNT AGAINST THE CALCULATION OF A SAILOR'S 
SRB AWARD UNLESS THE REENLISTMENT IS FOR GREATER THAN THE PERIOD OF THE 
INOPERATIVE EXTENSION PLUS 24 MONTHS DAY-FOR-DAY.  A SAILOR WITH A 24-
MONTH INOPERATIVE EXTENSION WHO EXECUTES A FOUR-YEAR REENLISTMENT ON, 
NOT BEFORE OR AFTER, THE EAOS WILL RECEIVE 48 MONTHS WORTH OF SRB.
    C.  IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO CANCEL AN INOPERATIVE EXTENSION IF THE 
REENLISTMENT MEETS THE 24 MONTHS DAY-FOR-DAY RULE.
10.  PRECERT REQUIREMENTS.  THE FOLLOWING ARE REQUIRED WHEN SUBMITTING 
PRECERT REQUESTS:
    A.  TO VALIDATE AN INOPERATIVE EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT AND EXPEDITE 
PROCESSING OF AN SRB REQUEST, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN THE REMARKS 
PARAGRAPH OF THE REQUEST:  TERM, NARRATIVE REASON, AUTHORITY,AND 
EXECUTION DATE OF ALL INOPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  FAILURE TO VERIFY 
EXTENSIONS MAY CAUSE PROCESSING DELAYS AND RESULT IN REJECTION OF THE 
REQUEST OR AN APPROVAL AT A LOWER AMOUNT.
    B.  A CONDITIONAL EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT (ANY EXTENSION LESS THAN 
24 MONTHS) MUST MEET THE REASONS AND TERMS SPECIFIED IN REF A AND 
MILPERSMAN 1160-040, AND MUST BE APPROVED BY PERS-811.  SAILORS MUST 
OBTAIN AN APPROVAL FOR EXTENSION FROM PERS-811 IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE 
POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF SRB ELIGIBILITY.
    C.  PERSONNEL IN A CLOSED LOOP NEC CAN REENLIST BY THE NEC ONLY.
11.  LITTORAL COMBAT SHIP (LCS) GUIDANCE.  SAILORS ASSIGNED TO LCS 
PLATFORMS OR WITH ORDERS TO AN LCS PLATFORM WHO POSSESS AN NEC 
SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED FOR LCS ASSIGNMENT (I.E., SO-CALLED HYBRID
SAILORS) ARE AUTHORIZED TO REENLIST FOR THE MORE LUCRATIVE SRB- 
ELIGIBLE NEC, REGARDLESS OF ASSIGNED RATING.
12.  REVISED AWARD PLAN.
    A.  A "-" SYMBOL PRECEDING AN AWARD LEVEL INDICATES A DECREASE TO 
THAT AWARD AND/OR CEILING LEVEL FOR THAT SPECIFIC ZONE.  A "+" SYMBOL 
PRECEDING AN AWARD LEVEL FOR A SPECIFIC ZONE OR PRECEDING A RATING 
INDICATES AN INCREASE TO THAT AWARD LEVEL AND/OR CEILING FOR THAT 
SPECIFIC ZONE OR THE ADDITION OF THE RATING TO THE SRB AWARD PLAN.
    B.  THE FOLLOWING RATINGS AND NECS ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR CONTINUED 
SUCCESS IN THE ONGOING GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM (GWOT) AND NAVY REMAINS 
COMMITTED TO ENSURING WE RETAIN THESE KEY SAILORS.  SEE PARA 13 FOR
