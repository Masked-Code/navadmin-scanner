REF/C/MSG/CNO/052016ZOCT07// NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 300/05 WHICH  
ANNOUNCED INTRODUCTION OF DLPT5 WITHIN NAVY.  REF B IS NAVADMIN 352/06  
WHICH PROMULGATED PROCEDURES FOR CONVERSION TO DLPT5 AND IMPLEMENTED  
TEMPORARY MEASURES TO FACILITATE THE TRANSITION, PARTICULARLY WHERE  
FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY BONUS (FLPB) CERTIFICATION WAS CONCERNED.  
REF C IS NAVADMIN 259/07 WHICH ANNOUNCED THE TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF  
DLPT5 AS TEST FOR MODERN STANDARD ARABIC PENDING RESOLUTION OF TECHNICAL  
ANOMALIES.// RMKS/1.  THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES TEMPORARY WAIVER POLICY  
GUIDANCE FOR PERSONNEL RECERTIFYING IN SPECIFIC LANGUAGES FOR FLPB?S.  
IT ALSO PROVIDES RESOURCES FOR PREPARING FOR THE NEW DLPT5 WEB-BASED  
PROFICIENCY TEST.  AS ANNOUNCED IN REFS A AND B, DLPT5 IS THE LATEST  
GENERATION OF LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY TESTING WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF  
DEFENSE (DOD).  THE WEB-BASED TEST REPLACES EARLIER PAPER AND PENCIL  
EXAMINATIONS AND IS A MUCH MORE CHALLENGING TEST OF LINGUISTIC  
PROFICIENCY, DESIGNED TO MEASURE ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE SKILL NOT  
PREVIOUSLY TESTED FOR.   
2.  BACKGROUND:  FOLLOWING 9/11 AND THE ADVENT OF DEFENSE LANGUAGE  
TRANSFORMATION, DLPT5 TRANSITIONED TESTING FROM PROFICIENCY IN COLD  
WAR-STYLE MILITARY-CENTRIC VOCABULARY AND SHORT PHRASES TO A MORE  
GLOBAL, NON-MILITARY LANGUAGE, LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN TWENTY-FIRST  
CENTURY SECURITY OPERATIONS.  DLPT5 THEREFORE INCORPORATES AUTHENTIC  
MATERIAL (I.E., BROADCASTS AND LIVE  
RECORDINGS) WHICH INCLUDES EXPANDED VOCABULARY, MORE ADVANCED GRAMMAR,  
AND NON-MILITARY CONTENT, ALL REQUIRING EXAMINEES NOT ONLY TO  
INTERPRET/TRANSLATE THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE INTO ENGLISH, BUT TO  
DEMONSTRATE A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTEXT AND MEANING  
CONTAINED IN TESTED PASSAGES.  AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE SHIFT IN LANGUAGE  
STYLE AND LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY, DLPT5 EXAMINEES HAVE IN MANY CASES  
RECEIVED LOWER THAN EXPECTED TEST SCORES.   
3.  WAIVER POLICY:  BECAUSE THE NEW WEB-BASED TEST IS MORE CHALLENGING,  
DOD AUTHORIZED THE SERVICES TO RECERTIFY MEMBERS FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD  
USING SCORES FROM THEIR LAST RECORDED DLPT IF A DLPT5 TEST RESULTED IN  
LOWER SCORES.  ALSO, IF WEB-BASED TESTING WAS NOT AVAILABLE OVERSEAS,  
THE DLPT5 REQUIREMENT WAS WAIVED PENDING THE INDIVIDUAL?S RELEASE FROM  
THE OCONUS ASSIGNMENT AND RETURN TO CONUS.  
RECERTIFICATION THROUGH DLPT5 IS REQUIRED WITHIN 180 DAYS.  
    A.  BY REF B, NAVY IMPLEMENTED DOD?S TEMPORARY MEASURES FOR ONE YEAR  
EFFECTIVE 31 DECEMBER 2006.  THE WAIVER APPLIES TO DLPT5 TESTS RELEASED  
PRIOR TO 1 OCTOBER 2007 (FY-08), WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGES  
(SEE NOTES 1 AND 2):  
ALBANIAN                                NORWEGIAN  
ARABIC-IRAQI                            PASHTO-AFGHAN  
ARABIC-LEVANTINE                        PERSIAN-AFGHAN  
CHINESE-MANDARIN LOWER RANGE            RUSSIAN LOWER RANGE  
CHINESE-MANDARIN UPPER RANGE            RUSSIAN UPPER RANGE  
GREEK                                   SERBO-CROATIAN LOWER RANGE  
HINDI                                   SPANISH LOWER RANGE  
KURDISH-SORANI LOWER RANGE              SPANISH UPPER RANGE  
URDU  
NOTE 1:  LOWER RANGE TESTS EXAMINE PROFICIENCY LEVEL UP TO INTERAGENCY  
ROUNDTABLE LEVEL (ILR) 3; UPPER RANGE TESTS MEASURE ABOVE ILR 3.  
NOTE 2:  REF C ADDRESSES TESTING AND CERTIFICATION FOR MODERN STANDARD  
ARABIC (MSA).  THE DLPT5 IN MSA HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED AND THE  
DLPT IV HAS BEEN REINSTATED.  NAVY TESTING POLICY RELATIVE TO THE DLPT5  
IN MSA HAS LIKEWISE BEEN TEMPORARILY MODIFIED AS A RESULT.  SEE REF C  
FOR DETAILS.  
    B.  THE ONE-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD AUTHORIZED BY DOD EXPIRES  
31 DECEMBER 2007.  WAIVERS EXECUTED WITHIN THE TRANSITION PERIOD REMAIN  
EFFECTIVE FOR ONE YEAR OR UNTIL THE MEMBER RECERTIFIES WITH A SECOND  
DLPT5.  AT THE END OF THE ONE-YEAR WAIVER PERIOD, ANNUAL CERTIFICATION  
FOR FLPB SHALL BE BASED SOLELY ON DLPT5 SCORES.   
    C.  TRANSITION/WAIVER POLICY FOR FUTURE DLPT5 CONVERSIONS.   
CONSISTENT WITH PARA 3 OF REF B, AS TESTING IN ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES IS  
CONVERTED AND AS THE NEW DLPT5 TESTS ARE DEPLOYED, THE SAME ONE-YEAR  
TRANSITION POLICY DESCRIBED ABOVE WILL APPLY.  THE TRANSITION PERIOD  
BEGINS ON THE DATE THE NEWLY-DEPLOYED DLPT5 BECOMES THE OFFICIAL TEST OF  
RECORD IN A PARTICULAR FOREIGN LANGUAGE.  DURING THIS TRANSITION PERIOD,  
MEMBERS WILL TEST IN THE NEW DLPT5 VERSION ON OR ABOUT THEIR NORMAL  
ANNUAL RECERTIFICATION DATE.  IF THEIR CORRESPONDING DLPT5 SCORES  
DECLINE FROM THE LAST RECORDED PRE-DLPT5 EXAM IN THE SAME LANGUAGE, THE  
MEMBER WILL HAVE THE OPTION OF USING THEIR MOST RECENT PRE-DLPT5 SCORE  
TO EXTEND THEIR FLPB CERTIFICATION, FOR ONE MORE YEAR.  SUBSEQUENT  
CERTIFICATIONS IN THE SAME LANGUAGE, HOWEVER, WILL BE BASED SOLELY ON  
DLPT5 SCORES.  THE ORAL PROFICIENCY INTERVIEW (OPI) REMAINS THE OFFICIAL  
TEST FOR MEASURING SPEAKING PROFICIENCY.  MEMBERS ASSIGNED OCONUS AND  
WITHOUT DLPT5 ACCESS WILL BE RECERTIFIED BASED ON THEIR MOST RECENT  
QUALIFYING OPI SCORE, SHOULD THEY REMAIN IN AN AREA WHEN  
DLPT5 IS NOT AVAILABILE FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR.  IN ALL CASES,  
NON-AVAILABILITY OF DLPT5 MUST BE VERIFIED BY NETPDTC.  
4.  DLPT5 PREPARATION.  GIVEN THE INCREASED DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY  
INHERENT IN DLPT5, POTENTIAL TEST TAKERS MUST PREPARE EARLY.  THE  
FOLLOWING LANGUAGE LEARNING RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP PREPARE FOR
