RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN summarizes Navy FY-18 retention performance, outlines 
the FY-19 retention environment, provides FY-19 reenlistment benchmarks and 
updates the FY-19 Retention Excellence Award (REA) criteria.  It also removes 
the requirement for the Command Information Program Review (CIPR) as an 
element of REA to reduce administrative distractions for those commands who 
consistently remain Brilliant on the Basics and achieve reenlistment 
benchmarks.

2.  FY-18 Performance.  Our FY-18 results were positive and serve as 
testament to your leadership, Sailor engagement and deckplate execution of 
new policies.  FY-18 retention surpassed the FY-18 benchmarks in all zones as 
we implemented numerous polices over the past year geared to support a 
growing Navy.  Attrition rates also decreased in all zones, but we need 
additional improvement in Zone A with a focus on reducing attrition of our 
newest Sailors during their first 180 days on active duty.

3.  FY-19 Retention Environment.  Navy remains on an aggressive growth 
trajectory and we must retain our best Sailors to ensure we have the manpower 
to support the Navy our Nation Needs.  With unemployment at the lowest levels 
since 1969 and wage growth increasing, we must recognize that our Sailors 
have options in the strong civilian job market.  I challenge each of you to 
lean forward and do your part to achieve maximum fleet readiness through 
increased retention and reduced attrition.  Let us focus on taking care of 
our Sailors by being Brilliant on the Basics as outlined in reference (a) and 
reinforced in references (b) through (d).
Brilliant on the Basics cannot just be a slogan, we must all live it every 
day.  Retention of our best Sailors begins from the minute they check-in to 
their first duty station.  Each of you, regardless of rank or expertise, are 
members of the Navy retention team.
Continue to lead well, and treat each Sailor like the valuable irreplaceable 
resource they are!

4.  FY-19 Reenlistment Benchmarks.  Although our recruiting and recruit 
training teams are doing a phenomenal job, we cannot grow by new accessions 
alone.  We will need to continue to increase retention of experienced Sailors 
to man the Navy our Nation Needs.
As such, we have increased our FY-19 reenlistment benchmarks for All-Navy 
reenlistments for echelon II and III commanders to use as part of their REA:
Zone A (0 TO 6 Years of Service)       55 percent
Zone B (6 TO 10 Years of Service)      65 percent
Zone C (10 TO 14 Years of Service)     80 percent
Zone A Attrition                       less than 6 percent
These benchmarks measure the effectiveness of our programs and ensure we meet 
manning requirements.  Reserve affiliations will be included in the 
computation.  Staying in the reserve component keeps Sailors on the Navy 
Team, and now, more than ever, our Navy Reserve Force has been answering the 
call.
    a.  Command-level performance relative to these All-Navy benchmarks will 
be affected by both the number of personnel and the rating-level composition 
of each command.  These factors merit consideration of any waiver requests by 
echelon II commands, type commanders (TYCOMs) and immediate superiors in 
command (ISICs).
    b.  As outlined in reference (c), echelon II commands will align their 
recognition programs to support the achievement of the FY-19 All-Navy 
benchmarks.

5.  Retention Excellence Award (REA).  The annual REA recognizes superior 
command accomplishment in executing programs and policies that best enable 
our Sailors to succeed in their naval careers.  The REA is built upon the 
tenets of references (a) and (b), Brilliant on the Basics.  Commands will be 
REA eligible if they meet the FY-19 retention and attrition benchmarks cited 
in paragraph 4.  Benchmarks must be met for at least two quarters, and for 
the fiscal year.
    a.  An eligible command must have a rated Navy Counselor (NC) or NEC 
806R.  If none billeted, command will be included as a part of REA 
consideration at the next superior in command level with rated NC or NEC 
806R.
    b.  Computation Exceptions.  One zone with zero transactions at or before 
EAOS will qualify as 100 percent reenlistment rate if the command has 
qualifying transactions in the other zones.  Only two zones may default to 
100 percent.
    c.  Loss transactions on a Sailor transferred from a command due to 
pending separation, medical hold or legal hold will reflect on the command 
the Sailor was last attached to in an accounting code
100 status.
    d.  Commands must have at a minimum one zone of qualifying transactions 
to be eligible for the REA.  Waivers may be considered on a case-by-case 
basis for small commands that have outstanding programs but no junior 
Sailors.
    e.  Requests for waivers of any award element in paragraph 4 must be 
submitted in writing via the respective ISIC/TYCOM with specific 
justification.  Waiver requests must be signed by the commanding officer.  
Requests not positively endorsed at any level will not be considered.  Waiver 
approval authority resides with echelon II commands.
    f.  TYCOM and direct reporting counselors will evaluate and submit 
eligible commands to their respective echelon II commands NLT
1 December 2019.

6.  REA Announcement and Recognition.  Echelon II commands should announce 
their FY-19 REA recipients following consolidation of echelon III and direct 
reporting command submissions no later than 31 December 2019.  Following the 
announcement message, awardees may fly the retention excellence pennant or 
paint their anchor gold until release of the following fiscal year award 
message.

7.  CIPR.  CIPR is the primary resource to assess the effectiveness of a 
commands career development program focusing on Sailor retention.  To 
incentivize healthy retention behavior and give time back to focus on 
training and warfighting readiness, commands who earn the REA and achieve 
reenlistment benchmarks are exempt from a TYCOM and ISIC review not to exceed 
two consecutive years.  Further guidance on CIPR execution and exemption 
policy will be detailed in a revision to references (c) and (d).
