RMKS/1.  THIS QUARTERLY SUICIDE PREVENTION UPDATE ADDRESSES 
THE CRITICAL ROLE VIGILANCE AND EARLY INTERVENTION PLAY IN 
SUICIDE PREVENTION.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE SUICIDE 
PREVENTION IS AN ALL HANDS EFFORT.  SUICIDE AWARENESS TRAINING 
PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT RISK FACTORS, WARNING SIGNS, AND 
RESPOND TO GET A SHIPMATE TO SAFETY.  TO STRENGTHEN OUR SUICIDE 
PREVENTION NETWORK, I ENCOURAGE ALL TO REVIEW THE INFORMATION 
AVAILABLE AT HTTP://WWW.SUICIDE.NAVY.MIL AND SHARE THIS 
KNOWLEDGE WITH YOUR FAMILY AND SHIPMATES.  BY IMPROVING 
AWARENESS, ELIMINATING MISPERCEPTIONS, AND REMOVING BARRIERS 
THAT PREVENT OUR PEOPLE FROM SEEKING THE SUPPORT AVAILABLE TO 
THEM, WE CAN ACHIEVE OUR GOAL OF SAVING LIVES.
