1.  As of 1 October 2021, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document Services no 
longer accepts Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures 
(MILSTRIP) requisitions for stock forms, such as tags, cards, handbooks and 
certificates, which consist of National Item Identification Numbers (NIIN) 
beginning with LF. 
The new Joint Forms Online (JFOL) powered by DLA Document Services Data 
Services Online (DSO) website is not compatible with MILSTRIPs. Requisitions 
submitted for LF NIINs since 1 October 2021 have not been processed. 
 
2.  The Fleet has been advised to order stock forms through the DSO website 
using their Government Purchase Card or through Military Interdepartmental 
Purchase Requests (MIPRs) (DD Form 448 MIPR) or DD Form 282 (DoD Printing 
Requisition/Order) located at https://www.esd.whs.mil/directives/forms/. 
If near deployment, Fleet customers are advised to over-order items that may 
deplete before returning to port. Contact DSOs Customer Support Center at 
contact.docsvcs@dla.mil or 1-866-736-7010 for expedited delivery. The JFOL 
user guide may be accessed at https://dso.dla.mil/dsf/JFOL_USER_GUIDE.pdf. 
 
3.  A DLA task group is being established to explore potential courses of 
action to better streamline the ordering process. In the meantime, all 
commands that placed orders with MILSTRIPs after 1 October 2021 must cancel 
those orders immediately and place a new order through the DSO website 
(https://dso.dla.mil/DSF/SmartStore.aspx). 
 
4.  Points of contact: 
    a.  Mr. Bobby Branscum, JFOL Program Manager with DLA Document Services, 
at Bobby.Branscum(AT)dla.mil. 
    b.  Mrs. Sonya Martin, DON Forms Manager and Information Management 
Control Officer, at Navy_FMO-IMCO_inquiry(AT)us.navy.mil.
