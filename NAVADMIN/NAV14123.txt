SUBJ/ARMED FORCES VOTERS WEEK AND OVERSEAS CITIZENS VOTERS WEEK//

Rmks/1.  June 30th - July 7th is Armed Forces and Overseas Citizens Voters 
Week.  With the November 4th general election right around the corner, now is 
the time to register to vote.  Voting is one of the fundamental rights 
enjoyed by U.S. citizens and a freedom that we defend. 

2.  Sailors, their family members, and citizens overseas who want to register 
to vote absentee can complete a Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) online 
at FVAP.gov.  Voters who require assistance can contact their command Voting 
Assistance Officer (VAO) or visit an Installation Voter Assistance Office.

3.  Region, installation, and command VAOs are encouraged to increase voter 
awareness through targeted voter information and marketing campaigns.  
Suggested activities include, but are not limited to: registration drives, 
advertising in local military media, unit training, and plan of the day 
notices, to name a few.  The 2014 Voting Toolkit provides samples of many of 
the ideas outlined above and can be downloaded at: 
http://www.fvap.gov/vao/continuity/vao-continuity under the heading 
"Good Ideas and Lessons Learned."

4.  All VAOs are directed to: 

    a.  Log into the Voting Information Management System (VIMS) and validate 
contact information on a quarterly basis: https://qol.navyaims.net/voting/

    b.  Ensure familiarity with voting assistance program guidance, in 
particular, the 2014 Navy Voting Action Plan: 
http://www.fvap.gov/vao/directives   

5.  My Point of Contact is LT Andrew Bousky who may be reached at 
andrew.bousky(at)navy.mil or (202) 433-4000.
