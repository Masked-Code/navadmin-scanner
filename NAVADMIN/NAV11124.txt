RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN IS AN UPDATE TO REF A AND CLARIFIES THE RULES GOVERNING 
MANAGEMENT OF THE RESERVE COMPONENT (RC) PERSONNEL MEDICAL HOLD (MEDHOLD) 
SCREENING AND ASSIGNMENT PROGRAM.  COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-95) IS THE BENEFITS 
ISSUING AUTHORITY
(BIA) FOR THE NAVY RC
MEDHOLD PROGRAM DESCRIBED IN REF B.

2.  MEDHOLD IS A SHORT-TERM MEDICAL TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR RESERVE COMPONENT 
SAILORS WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF ADDRESSING MEDICAL CONDITIONS INCURRED OR 
AGGRAVATED AFTER COMPLETION OF CONTINUOUS ACTIVE DUTY ORDERS FOR MORE THAN 30 
DAYS.
EVIDENCE MUST EXIST IN THE MEDICAL RECORD THAT A CONDITION WAS IDENTIFIED AND 
DOCUMENTED AFTER THE SAILOR COMPLETED 30 DAYS OF ACTIVE DUTY.  PER REF B, AND 
WITH THE MEMBER'S CONSENT, A MEMBER MAY THEN BE ORDERED TO, OR CONTINUED ON, 
ACTIVE DUTY TO COMPLETE FURTHER MEDICAL EVALUATION (MEDEVAL) AND TO RECEIVE 
AUTHORIZED MEDICAL CARE UNDER THE MEDHOLD PROGRAM.

3.  PERSONNEL WILL NORMALLY BE LIMITED TO A TOTAL OF 12 MONTHS ON MEDHOLD IN 
PERIODS NO GREATER THAN 6 MONTHS. PERIODS EXCEEDING 12 MONTHS IN TOTAL 
DURATION REQUIRE COMNAVPERSCOM
PERS-95 APPROVAL AND WILL BE APPROVED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS IF THE MEDICAL 
CONDITION WILL BE RESOLVED DURING AN ADDITIONAL 6 MONTH MEDHOLD PERIOD.  PER 
REF C, THE CASE WILL BE ENTERED INTO THE DISABILITY EVALUATION SYSTEM (DES) 
AND THE SAILOR WILL BE REFERRED TO THE PHYSICAL EVALUATION BOARD (PEB) FOR 
DETERMINATION OF FITNESS TO CONTINUE NAVAL SERVICE, ENTITLEMENT TO BENEFITS, 
DISABILITY RATINGS, AND DISPOSITION OF THE SERVICE MEMBER.

4.  THE MERE EXISTENCE OF AN ILLNESS, INJURY, OR DISEASE DOES NOT NECESSARILY 
QUALIFY A SAILOR FOR MEDHOLD.  THE CONDITION MUST RESULT IN THE SAILOR BEING 
UNFIT FOR DUTY.
SAILORS FOUND FIT FOR DUTY, PER REF B, WHO REQUIRE MEDICAL CARE FOR A MINOR OR 
CHRONIC CONDITION WILL BE MANAGED IAW BELOW PARA 5(A)(1).  CONTINUED TREATMENT 
FOR SUCH CONDITIONS MAY BE MANAGED USING THE SAILOR'S VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA), 
TRICARE BENEFITS, OR THE LINE OF DUTY (LOD) BENEFITS PROGRAM DESCRIBED IN REF 
B.
