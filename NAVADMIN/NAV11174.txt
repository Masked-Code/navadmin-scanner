SUBJ/FAMILYGRAM 03-11 RELOCATION ASSISTANCE//

RMKS/1.  THE FOCUS OF THIS MONTH'S FAMILYGRAM IS RELOCATION ASSISTANCE.  THERE 
ARE MANY RESOURCES AVAILABLE FROM NAVY AND DOD TO ASSIST FAMILIES WITH THEIR 
MOVES.  THESE RESOURCES HELP MAKE THE MOVE A SMOOTH TRANSITION.

2.  RELOCATION.  LATE SPRING TO EARLY FALL IS ONE OF THE BUSIEST PERMANENT 
CHANGE OF STATION (PCS) PERIODS OF THE YEAR.  THE SCHOOL YEAR ENDS AND NEW 
CHALLENGES AWAIT.  CHALLENGES SUCH AS FINDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, REPUTABLE 
SCHOOLS, EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, CHILDCARE AND PET CARE ARE OFTEN PART OF 
THE PCS PROCESS.  RELOCATION TO A NEW DUTY STATION IS NEVER EASY BUT CAN BE 
LESS STRESSFUL WITH PROPER PLANNING AND USE OF THE SERVICES LISTED HERE.

MOVING PROCESS LESS CHALLENGING.  FROM SMOOTH MOVE WORKSHOPS TO HOUSEHOLD 
LOANER KITS, SAILORS ARE PROVIDED WITH IMPORTANT AND USEFUL RESOURCES TO MAKE 
THEIR TRANSITION TO A NEW DUTY STATION MORE EFFICIENT.  SERVICES PROVIDED 
THROUGH ADVANCED WEB-BASED TECHNOLOGY AND PERSONALIZED ASSISTANCE INCLUDE:
(1) ONE-STOP ASSISTANCE WHERE SAILORS AND FAMILY MEMBERS CAN OBTAIN RELOCATION 
INFORMATION AND SERVICES THAT REDUCE RELOCATION COST, EASE ADMINISTRATIVE 
BURDENS, PROMOTE QUALITY OF LIFE AND ULTIMATELY ENHANCE MISSION READINESS.
(2) ASSISTANCE FOR THE SERVICE MEMBER AND FAMILY WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
NEW DUTY STATION SUCH AS COST OF LIVING, HOUSING AVAILABILITY, MEDICAL CARE 
AND TREATMENT FACILITIES, SCHOOLS, SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND 
CULTURAL ADAPTATION TRAINING FOR OVERSEAS DUTY ASSIGNMENTS.

EXPLORE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, AND CONNECT WITH LOCAL EXPERTS TO ADDRESS
