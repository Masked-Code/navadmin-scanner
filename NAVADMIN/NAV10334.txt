RMKS/1.  IAW REF A, STARTING 1 NOVEMBER 2010, THE OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY 
OPERATIONS (OCO) SUPPORT ASSIGNMENT
(OSA) PROCESS WILL REPLACE THE GSA DETAILING PROCESS FOR ENLISTED 
SAILORS.  THIS NAVADMIN SUPERCEDES REFS B AND C.

2.  OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS SUPPORT ASSIGNMENT (OSA) PROCESS 
OVERVIEW.
    A.  PRIOR TO ENTERING INTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH RATING DETAILER,
    SAILORS DESIRING AN
INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION ASSIGNMENT SHOULD SELECT THE "OSA PREFERENCE"
OPTION IN THE
SPECIAL PROGRAMS SECTION OF THEIR DUTY PREFERENCE PAGE IN CMS/ID, NINE 
TO TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO THEIR CURRENT PROJECTED ROTATION DATE (PRD).  
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT SAILORS UPDATE THEIR EMAIL AND PHONE CONTACT 
INFORMATION IN CMS/ID PRIOR TO SELECTING THE OSA PREFERENCE OPTION TO 
FACILITATE TIMELY CONTACT AND NEGOTIATIONS PRIOR TO THE MEMBER ENTERING 
INTO THEIR NORMAL DETAILING WINDOW.  PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) SCREENING 
AND APPROVAL IS A PRE-REQUISITE FOR OSA SELECTION, UNLESS THE CURRENT 
EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE (EAOS)/SOFT EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE 
OBLIGATED SERVICE (SEAOS) DATE IS SET BEYOND THE END OF OSA ESTIMATED 
RETURN DATE PLUS THREE MONTHS.  IN GENERAL, THIS MEANS THAT UNLESS YOUR 
EAOS/SEAOS IS AT LEAST 15-16 MONTHS BEYOND YOUR CURRENT PRD MONTH (FOR 
12-MONTH ASSIGNMENTS), YOU WILL NEED PTS APPROVAL TO ESTABLISH 
ELIGIBILITY FOR AN OSA ASSIGNMENT.
    B.  SAILORS WILL BE CONTACTED BY NAVPERSCOM (NPC) OSA
    DETAILING CELL (PERS 4013GS) AFTER THE SAILOR HAS SELECTED THE OSA 
PREFERENCE OPTION IN THEIR CMS /ID SPECIAL DUTY PREFERENCE PAGE.
    C.  SAILORS AND THE PERS OSA DETAILING CELL WILL WORK
    TOGETHER TO FIND AN OSA BILLET
FOR WHICH THE SAILOR IS A GOOD FIT.  SAILORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO HAVE AN 
IDEA OF THE THEATER/COUNTRY, LENGTH OF TOUR, AND TYPE OF BILLET THEY 
PREFER.  IF A BILLET IS NOT AGREED UPON, OR NO BILLET IS AVAILABLE, THE 
SAILOR WILL COMMENCE NORMAL RATING DETAILER NEGOTIATIONS AND CMS/ID 
APPLICATIONS ONCE IN THEIR NINE MONTH PRD WINDOW.
    D.  OSA NOMINATIONS WILL BE SUBMITTED TO UNITED STATES FLEET
    FORCES (USFF) FOR FINAL APPROVAL.  ONCE APPROVED, THE PERS OSA 
DETAILING CELL AND THE SAILOR, ALONG WITH THE RESPECTIVE GEOGRAPHIC 
BUDGET SUBMITTING OFFICE (BSO)/TYPE COMMANDER (TYCOM), WILL BE NOTIFIED 
OF SELECTION.  THE SELECTED SAILOR WILL BE CONSIDERED "UNDER ORDERS"
FOR PCS DETAILING PURPOSES UNTIL THEIR PRD IS ADJUSTED AND THEY ROLL 
INTO THEIR NEW DETAILING WINDOW.
    E.  TEMPORARY ADDITIONAL DUTY (TEMADD) ORDERS SHALL BE
    WRITTEN BY NPC WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF THE SAILOR'S SUCCESSFUL 
ACCEPTANCE BY USFF AS AN OSA CANDIDATE.  INTERMEDIATE TEMPORARY DUTY 
(ITDY) ORDERS WILL BE ISSUED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.
    F.  TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO FIRST I-STOP (NMPS REPORT DATE), AND
    UPON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF ALL IA/OSA PRE-SCREENINGS, PERS-40 
WILL ADJUST THE SAILOR'S PRD AND APPLY AN OSA DISTRIBUTABLE NAVY 
ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION (DNEC) CODE.  THE NEW PRD WILL BE 60 DAYS AFTER 
THE ESTIMATED RETURN FROM THE OSA TOUR.  THE OSA DNEC WILL MASK THE 
SAILOR FROM THEIR PARENT COMMAND'S MANNING AND THE OSA SAILOR WILL NOT 
COUNT AGAINST THE COMMAND FOR MANNING PURPOSES.
    G.  FOLLOW-ON PCS ORDERS.  WHEN OSA SAILORS ARE WITHIN NINE
    MONTHS OF THEIR NEW PRD, THEY WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO NEGOTIATE ORDERS 
WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE RATING DETAILER.
    H.  UPON COMPLETION OF THE OSA DEPLOYMENT, SAILORS WILL RETURN TO 
THEIR EXISTING (PRE-OSA) PARENT COMMAND FOR APPROXIMATELY 60 DAYS PRIOR 
TO DEPARTING FOR THEIR NEXT PCS ASSIGNMENT.  THE 60 DAYS AT THE PARENT 
COMMAND SHALL BE RESERVED FOR REINTEGRATION, POST-DEPLOYMENT SCREENINGS, 
LEAVE, AND PCS MOVE PREPARATION (HHG MOVE SETUP, ADMINISTRATIVE 
PROCESSES, ETC.).  SAILORS SHALL THEN EXECUTE THEIR NEW PCS ORDERS, AS 
WRITTEN.

3.  OSA ADMINISTRATION AND PREREQUISITES.
    A.  OSA CANDIDATE BUSINESS RULES.
        (1) OSA ELIGIBILITY.  SAILORS WHO VOLUNTEER FOR AN IA
        ASSIGNMENT AND ARE WITHIN NINE AND TWELVE MONTHS OF PRD.  
SAILORS WITHIN NINE MONTHS OF THEIR PRD ALSO MAY APPLY FOR OSA ORDERS BY 
DIRECTLY CONTACTING THEIR RATING DETAILER WHO WILL NOMINATE THEM, 
PROVIDED THEIR RATING DETAILER CONCURS WITH THE ASSIGNMENT, TO THE PERS 
OSA DETAILING CELL FOR AN OSA ASSIGNMENT.
        (2) SAILORS WHO PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED AN IA ASSIGNMENT MAY 
VOLUNTEER FOR AN OSA ASSIGNMENT.
        (3) SAILORS WHO ARE TRANSFERRING FROM A NAVY "A" OR "C" SCHOOL 
ASSIGNMENT AND HAVE NOT YET COMPLETED THEIR FIRST PCS TOUR ARE NOT 
ELIGIBLE FOR AN OSA ASSIGNMENT.
        (4) RANK.  OSA CANDIDATES MUST BE ONE UP/ONE DOWN FROM THE 
STATED REQUIREMENT, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED IN THE REQUIREMENT.  OSA 
CANDIDATES MUST BE E-3 OR ABOVE AT THE TIME OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCREENING 
TO BE ACCEPTED FOR OSA ASSIGNMENTS WITH THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONS:  (1) 
OSA CANDIDATES MUST BE E-4 OR ABOVE FOR ASSIGNMENT TO DETAINEE 
OPERATIONS MISSIONS; AND (2) HOSPITAL APPRENTICE (HA/E-2) SAILORS MAY 
SERVE IN HEALTH SERVICE AUGMENTATION PROGRAM (HSAP) BILLETS DUE TO THEIR 
SPECIALIZED TRAINING AND MEDICAL SKILLS.  ADDITIONAL EXCEPTIONS MAY BE 
EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.
       (5) LOW SUPPLY/HIGH DEMAND (LS/HD).  PERSONNEL LS/HD SKILL SETS 
MAY NOT BE USED TO FILL A REQUIREMENT OUTSIDE THEIR SKILL SET AND SHALL 
NOT BE ASSIGNED TO AN "ANY RATING OR ANY PETTY OFFICER" OSA BILLET 
ASSIGNMENT.  USFF N1 WILL MANAGE AND TASK LS/HD COMMUNITIES.
       (6) SECURITY CLEARANCE.  AT THE TIME OF THE OSA REQUEST, 
CANDIDATES MUST POSSESS THE REQUIRED SECURITY CLEARANCE, OR HAVE INTERIM 
CLEARANCE GRANTED AND THE APPROPRIATE INVESTIGATION INITIATED.  
CLEARANCE STATUS, INCLUDING INTERIM CLEARANCE STATUS, MUST BE REFLECTED 
IN JPAS.
       (7) NEC.  IF A NEC IS SPECIFICALLY STATED IN THE REQUIREMENT, THE 
OSA CANDIDATE MUST CURRENTLY HOLD THE APPROPRIATE NEC.  USFF N1 HOLDS 
WAIVER AUTHORITY.
       (8) PRD.  THE START OF THE OSA ORDERS MUST CONFORM TO CURRENT 
DETAILING RULES (I.E., PRD MUST BE WITHIN THREE (3) MONTHS OF START OF 
OSA).
       (9) EAOS.
           (A) SAILORS MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME REMAINING ON CURRENT 
ENLISTMENT TO COMPLETE THE OSA TOUR.  IF A SAILOR HAS BEEN SELECTED FOR 
AN OSA, BUT DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT EAOS TIME TO COMPLETE THE OSA 
DEPLOYMENT, THEY ARE REQUIRED TO BE PTS SCREENED AND APPROVED, AS 
APPROPRIATE.  THE SAILOR, THROUGH THE PARENT COMMAND AND LOCAL PSD, MUST 
COMPLETE THE OBLISERV REQUIREMENT OF A MINIMUM OF 90 DAYS (MAXIMUM OF 
120 DAYS FOR EXTENSIONS OF ENLISTMENT) AFTER THE ESTIMATED RETURN FROM 
THE OSA TOUR.  THIS SHOULD BE COMPLETED WITHIN 30 DAYS OF TEMADD/ITDY 
ORDERS DTG AND IS INCLUDED AS PART OF THE EXPEDITIONARY SCREENING 
CHECKLIST.
           (B) ALTHOUGH REENLISTMENT IS DESIRED, IF THE SAILOR IS 
ELIGIBLE IN ALL RESPECTS, RECEIPT OF TEMADD/ITDY ORDERS SERVES AS 
SUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION FOR OSA ASSIGNMENT AND ALLOWS OVERMANNED RATING 
ZONES TO EXTEND IN ORDER TO MEET OBLISERV WITHOUT PERS-811 
AUTHORIZATION.
THIS MESSAGE ALSO PROVIDES EARLY REENLISTMENT WINDOW FOR NON-SRB SAILORS 
TO MEET OBLISERV.  ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, AFTER RECEIPT OF TEMADD/ITDY 
ORDERS, PERS-811 WILL ENTERTAIN EXCEPTIONS TO EXTENSION POLICIES FOR 
RATINGS/NECS LISTED IN THE LATEST SRB NAVADMIN THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE 
SRB REENLISTMENT WINDOW.
        (10) PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS).  SAILORS MUST BE PTS SCREENED AND 
APPROVED, AS APPROPRIATE, TO BE SELECTED FOR AN OSA DEPLOYMENT, UNLESS 
THE CURRENT EAOS/SEAOS DATE IS SET BEYOND THE END OF OSA ESTIMATED 
RETURN DATE PLUS THREE MONTHS.  IN GENERAL, THIS MEANS THAT UNLESS YOUR 
EAOS/SEAOS IS AT LEAST 15-16 MONTHS BEYOND YOUR CURRENT PRD MONTH (FOR 
12-MONTH ASSIGNMENTS), YOU WILL NEED PTS APPROVAL TO ESTABLISH 
ELIGIBILITY FOR AN OSA DEPLOYMENT.  DUE TO THE TIMING OF SELECTION FOR 
AN OSA DEPLOYMENT, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT SAILORS SUBMIT A PTS 
APPLICATION NO LATER THAN 13 MONTHS PRIOR TO PRD.  THIS IS TO ENSURE 
THEY ARE IN THE PTS SYSTEM AND HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATELY SCREENED PRIOR TO 
APPLYING FOR AN OSA DEPLOYMENT.
        (11) OVERSEAS TOUR EXTENSION INCENTIVES PROGRAM (OTEIP).  A 
SAILOR THAT IS ELECTING TO EXECUTE AN OSA DEPLOYMENT FROM AN OCONUS 
LOCATION IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE OTEIP, AS REFERENCED IN REF H, DUE TO 
EXTENDED TAD STATUS.
        (12) STATUS-OF-FORCES AGREEMENT (SOFA).
             (A) A SOFA WITH A FOREIGN NATION PROTECTS SAILORS AND THEIR 
DEPENDENTS WHILE STATIONED OCONUS.  PROVIDED THAT THE OVERSEAS COMMANDER 
AGREES TO HOST DEPENDENTS WHILE THE SAILOR IS ON IA, SOFA POLICIES 
GENERALLY SHOULD NOT REQUIRE FAMILIES TO LEAVE THE FOREIGN COUNTRY IN 
WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY SERVING.
             (B) IF A SAILOR ASSIGNED TO AN OVERSEAS COMMAND WOULD LIKE 
TO VOLUNTEER FOR OSA, PRIOR TO SELECTING AN OSA ON THEIR PREFERENCE PAGE 
ON CMS/ID, THEY MUST FIRST INQUIRE, VIA THEIR CURRENT CHAIN-OF-COMMAND, 
IF THAT PARTICULAR COMMAND/COMMANDER CAN HOST THE DEPENDENTS WHILE THE 
MEMBER IS TAD ON AN OSA ASSIGNMENT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH LOCAL SOFA RULES.  
IF THE COMMAND CANNOT HOST THE DEPENDENTS DUE TO SOFA, THE SAILOR CAN 
STILL APPLY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY MUST QUALIFY FOR A 
DESIGNATED-PLACE MOVE VIA ITDY ORDERS FOR THEIR DEPENDENTS AND MUST 
INFORM THE PERS OSA DETAILING CELL OF THE SITUATION AND THE FAMILY'S 
INTENTIONS DURING THE NEGOTIATION PHASE.
            (C) IF A SAILOR IS REQUIRED TO MOVE HIS/HER FAMILY BACK TO A 
CONUS LOCATION DURING THE OSA DEPLOYMENT, OR IF THE PARTICULAR HOST 
NATION SOFA RULES ARE SO RESTRICTIVE AS TO NOT ALLOW A MEMBER TO KEEP 
DEPENDENTS IN THE PRESENT LOCATION WHILE TAD ON AN OSA DEPLOYMENT, THEN 
SAILORS MAY QUALIFY FOR A DESIGNATED-PLACE MOVE VIA ITDY ORDERS.  
CONTACT PERS 4G FOR MORE INFORMATION USING THE IAHHG@NAVY.MIL EMAIL 
ADDRESS FOR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS.
            (D) RETURN OF DEPENDENTS FROM A DESIGNATED-PLACE MOVE BACK 
TO THE OCONUS PDS IS LIMITED TO CASES WHERE THE MEMBER HAS 12 MONTHS OR 
MORE REMAINING AT THE OLD PDS AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF DEPENDENTS OR 
HOUSEHOLD GOODS, WHICHEVER IS LATER, AND DOES NOT HAVE FOLLOW ON PCS 
ORDERS.
        (13) HIGH YEAR TENURE (HYT).
             (A) SAILORS DETERMINED TO BE HYT MAY VOLUNTEER FOR OSA 
ORDERS PROVIDED THE ESTIMATED RETURN FROM DEPLOYMENT ALLOWS FOR A 
MINIMUM OF FOUR MONTHS TRANSITION BETWEEN RETURN AND THE MANDATORY 
SEPARATION DATE.
             (B) REQUESTS TO WAIVE MINIMUM TRANSITION TIME WILL BE 
EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.
             (C) SAILORS ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF OSA ORDERS, WHO ARE 
SUBSEQUENTLY DEEMED TO BE HYT, WILL BE EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS 
BY USFF AND NPC.
        (14) RETIREMENT.
             (A) SAILORS WHO HAVE SUBMITTED AND BEEN APPROVED FOR 
RETIREMENT MAY NOT VOLUNTEER FOR OSA ORDERS UNLESS THE ESTIMATED RETURN 
FROM DEPLOYMENT ALLOWS FOR A MINIMUM OF FIVE MONTHS TRANSITION BETWEEN 
RETURN AND RETIREMENT DATE.
             (B) REQUESTS TO WAIVE MINIMUM TRANSITION TIME WILL BE 
EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.
       (15) AUXILIARY.  NO "AUXILIARIES" WILL BE IDENTIFIED FOR OSA 
BILLETS.  IF A SELECTEE FALLS OUT GREATER THAN 150 DAYS BEFORE FIRST I-
STOP, PERS WILL ATTEMPT TO REPLACE THE UNPLANNED LOSS.  IF FALLOUT 
OCCURS AT 150 DAYS OR LESS BEFORE THE FIRST I-STOP, PERS SHALL PASS TO 
USFF FOR IAMM SOURCING.  OSA CANDIDATES CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED AS EMBEDDED 
ALTERNATES, BUT THEY CAN BE USED TO FILL A BILLET IF A PRIMARY CANDIDATE 
FALLS OUT, PROVIDED THE RATING DETAILER AGREES.
    B.  OSA ORDERS.
       (1) TYPE OF ORDERS.  ONCE APPROVED FOR AN OSA BILLET, SAILORS 
RECEIVE TEMADD OR ITDY ORDERS ISSUED BY PERS-4G3.  THE ORDERS WILL BE 
FROM THE SAILOR'S CURRENT PARENT COMMAND FOR THE DURATION OF THE OSA 
DEPLOYMENT.
       (2) PRD.  AN OSA SAILOR'S PRD WILL BE ADJUSTED APPROXIMATELY TWO 
WEEKS PRIOR TO FIRST I-STOP (NMPS DATE) OF OSA ORDERS.  THE OSA SAILOR'S 
PRD WILL BE ADJUSTED TO THE ESTIMATED RETURN DATE PLUS 60 DAYS.  SAILORS 
WILL RETURN TO THEIR PARENT COMMAND UPON COMPLETION OF OSA DEPLOYMENT 
FOR THIS 60-DAY PERIOD.
       (3) OSA DNEC CODE.  NPC WILL ASSIGN AN OSA DNEC CODE TO OSA 
SAILORS APPROXIMATELY TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO THE FIRST I-STOP OF OSA ORDERS.  
THIS OSA DNEC WILL PLACE THE SAILOR IN A SEPARATE DISTRIBUTION CATEGORY, 
ENSURING THE PARENT COMMAND MANNING/READINESS LEVELS ARE UNAFFECTED BY 
THE SAILOR'S OSA ASSIGNMENT.  IT ALSO ALLOWS A NORMAL RELIEF REQUISITION 
TO BE GENERATED FOR FILL AT THE SAILOR'S ORIGINALPRD.  STANDARD 
ASSIGNMENT, DETAILING, REQUISITION PRIORITY AND PROCEDURES REMAIN IN 
EFFECT FOR BILLETS VACATED BY SAILORS SELECTING AN OSA ASSIGNMENT.
       (4) OSA ORDERS.  SAILORS CAN VIEW TEMADD/ITDY ORDERS ON
       BUPERS ONLINE (BOL):
           (A) LOG ONTO BUPERS ONLINE AT HTTPS://BOL.NAVY.MIL/;
           (B) SELECT THE "NMCMPS" LINK OR "VIEW IA ORDERS" LINK;
           (C) CLICK "VIEW MY ORDERS" IN UPPER MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN.
       (5) OSA PARENT COMMAND.  THE OSA SAILOR WILL ADMINISTRATIVELY 
REMAIN WITH THEIR CURRENT PARENT COMMAND THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE 
OSA ASSIGNMENT.  PARENT COMMANDS RETAIN ALL COMMAND IA COORDINATOR 
(CIAC) RESPONSIBILITIES PRIOR TO, DURING, AND AFTER THE SAILOR'S OSA 
ASSIGNMENT.
PARENT COMMAND WILL CONDUCT A PROPER HAND-OFF OF CIAC DUTIES WHEN SAILOR 
PERMANENTLY DETACHES TO ENSURE POST-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLISTS ARE COMPLETED.
       (6) OSA PRE-SCREENING REQUIREMENTS.  ALL OSA SAILORS
       REQUIRE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND PERSONNEL SUITABILITY SCREENING PER 
THE EXPEDITIONARY SCREENING CHECKLIST POSTED ON HTTP://WWW.IA.NAVY.MIL 
WITHIN 30 DAYS OF TEMADD/ITDY ORDERS DTG.  DEPENDENT SCREENING IS NOT 
REQUIRED.  WHEN SERVICE MEMBER SCREENING IS COMPLETE, COMMAND 
REPRESENTATIVES (WITH COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR OR ABOVE ACCESS), SHOULD 
ENTER RESULTS ON BOL USING THE "IA ASSIGNMENT" BUTTON.  COMMANDS FAILING 
TO COMPLETE SCREENING WITHIN THE 30 DAYS OF TEMADD/ITDY ORDERS DATE TIME 
GROUP
(DTG) WILL RECEIVE A USFF DELINQUENT REPORT OF SUITABILITY FOR OSA 
SCREENING MESSAGE.  PARENT COMMANDS MUST IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY USFF (VIA 
BSO/TYCOM) AND ANNOTATE THE OVERSEAS/IA SCREENING APPLICATION ON BOL IF 
AN OSA SAILOR IS DETERMINED "UNSUITABLE" PER STANDARDS AS SET FORTH IN 
THE EXPEDITIONARY SCREENING CHECKLIST.
    C.  CHANGES TO OSA ORDERS.  ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL RECEIVES OSA ORDERS, 
CERTAIN SCENARIOS MAY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THOSE ORDERS.  THE 
FOLLOWING WILL
APPLY:
       (1) TRAINING TRACK CHANGES.  OSA ORDERS MAY ADJUST DUE TO 
NECESSARY CHANGES IN TRAINING TRACKS TO SUPPORT MISSION REQUIREMENTS.
           (A) USFF MAY MODIFY (CHANGE THE START DATE) OSA ORDERS BY 
ORDERS MODIFIED (ORDMOD) TO DEPART UP TO 30 DAYS PRIOR TO OR 90 DAYS 
LATER THAN THE ORIGINAL FIRST I-STOP DATE DUE TO CHANGES IN MISSION OR 
TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.  USFF WILL INFORM BSO /TYCOM/PERS OSA CELL OF 
ORDERS CHANGES, AND WILL INFORM THE OSA SAILOR VIA THEIR CHAIN OF 
COMMAND.  IF ESTIMATED DATE OF RETURN SHIFTS LATER BY MORE THAN 30 DAYS, 
THEN PERS OSA DETAILING CELL WILL BE INFORMED BY USFF TO ADJUST THE PRD 
ACCORDINGLY.
           (B) IF SHIFT WILL BE GREATER THAN STATED ABOVE, THE SAILOR 
WILL BE GIVEN AN OPTION TO ACCEPT THE NEW TIMELINE OR REQUEST NEW OSA 
ORDERS.   USFF WILL WORK WITH THE BSO/TYCOM/PERS OSA CELL TO FIND A NEW 
BILLET.  WHEN POSSIBLE, USFF WILL PROVIDE UP TO THREE ALTERNATIVE IA 
BILLETS AS OPTIONS FOR THE PERS OSA CELL TO DISCUSS WITH THE SAILOR.  IF 
THE SAILOR DOES NOT ACCEPT ONE OF THE NEWLY PROPOSED BILLETS ORNO LONGER 
DESIRES TO GO ON AN OSA DEPLOYMENT, THE OSA CELL WILL INFORM USFF AND 
THE SAILOR'S RATING DETAILER AND THE SAILOR WILL BE DETAILED TO A NEW 
PCS ASSIGNMENT.
        (2) MISSION CANCELLATION.  IF AN OSA BILLET IS CANCELLED, THE 
SAILOR WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO BE ASSIGNED TO ANOTHER OSA BILLET, 
PROVIDED ONE IS AVAILABLE WITHIN RANK AND SKILL-SET MATCH.  USFF 
WILLWORK WITH THE BSO/TYCOM/PERS OSA CELL TO IDENTIFY A NEW BILLET 
ASSIGNMENT.
WHEN POSSIBLE, USFF WILL PROVIDE UP TO THREE ALTERNATIVE IA BILLETS AS 
OPTIONS FOR THE PERS OSA CELL TO DISCUSS WITH THE SAILOR.  IF THE SAILOR 
DOES NOT ACCEPT ONE OF THE NEWLY PROPOSED BILLETS OR NO LONGER DESIRES 
TO GO ON AN OSA DEPLOYMENT, THE PERS OSA CELL WILL INFORM USFF AND THE 
SAILOR'S RATING DETAILER, AND THE MEMBER WILL BE DETAILED TO A NEW PCS 
ASSIGNMENT. IF A MEMBER HAS INITIATED AN OBLISERVE EXTENSION THROUGH 
THEIR RESPECTIVE PERSONNEL OFFICE AND DOES NOT GO FORWARD ON THE OSA DUE 
TO A MISSION CANCELLATION, IT IS INCUMBENT ON THE PARENT COMMAND TO 
CANCEL THE OBLISERVE VIA THEIR RESPECTIVE PERSONNEL OFFICE.
        (3) OSA FALLOUTS.  IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OSA SAILOR 
AND PARENT COMMAND TO NOTIFY USFF (VIA BSO/TYCOM/PERS OSA CELL) 
IMMEDIATELY SHOULD AN OSA SAILOR FALLOUT FOR ANY REASON (FAILURE OF 
EXPEDITIONARY SCREENING CHECKLIST, MEDICAL, EXTREME FAMILY HARDSHIP, 
ETC.).
SHOULD AN OSA SAILOR FALL OUT, USFF WILL INFORM THE PERS OSA DETAILING 
CELL TO NOTIFY THE SAILOR'S RATING DETAILER AND THE SAILOR WILL BE 
DETAILED TO A NEW PCS ASSIGNMENT.  IF A MEMBER HAS INITIATED AN 
OBLISERVE EXTENSION THROUGH THEIR RESPECTIVE PERSONNEL OFFICE AND DOES 
NOT GO FORWARD ON THE OSA DUE TO A FALLOUT, IT IS INCUMBENTON THE PARENT 
COMMAND TO CANCEL THE OBLISERVE VIA THEIR RESPECTIVE PERSONNEL OFFICE.
        (4) EXTENSIONS IN THEATER.
            (A) OSA SAILORS MAY REQUEST AN EXTENSION IN THEATER PROVIDED 
THAT: (1) THE EXTENSION REQUEST IS APPROVED BY THEIR CHAIN OF COMMAND IN 
THEATER;
(2) THEIR RATING DETAILER

NEXT ROTATION; AND (4) THERE ARE NO PTS/HYT CONFLICTS.
            (B) SAILORS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT AN ENLISTED PERSONNEL 
ACTION REQUEST (NAVPERS 1306/7) TO THEIR RESPECTIVE RATING DETAILER.
            (C) ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS/REQUIREMENTS MAY BE APPLICABLE 
BASED ON LOCATION/AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY OF OSA ASSIGNMENT AND/OR TYPE 
OF DUTY /MISSION.
        (5) BACK-TO-BACK OSA.
            (A) OSA SAILORS MAY APPLY FOR BACK-TO-BACK OSA DEPLOYMENTS 
USING THE STANDARD OSA PROCESS.
            (B) CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS/REQUIREMENTS MAY BE APPLICABLE 
BASED ON LOCATION/AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY OF OSA DEPLOYMENT AND/OR TYPE 
OF DUTY /MISSION.

4.  OSA SAILOR BENEFITS.
    A.  ANY SAILOR WHO HAS COMPLETED AN OSA OR GSA DEPLOYMENT SHALL BE 
EXCLUDED FROM SELECTION FOR IA ASSIGNMENT FOR THREE (3) YEARS AFTER 
COMPLETION OF IA DEPLOYMENT. LS/HD RATINGS THAT DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT 
INVENTORY TO SUPPORT A THREE-YEAR EXCLUSION WILL BE HANDLED ON A CASE-
BY-CASE BASIS.
    B.  SAILORS MAY QUALIFY FOR A DESIGNATED PLACE MOVE VIA ITDY ORDERS 
ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.  CONTACT PERS-4G FOR MORE INFORMATION ON 
QUALIFICATIONS OR USE THE IAHHG@NAVY.MIL EMAIL ADDRESS FOR SPECIFIC 
QUESTIONS.
    C.  SAILORS WHO VOLUNTEER FOR AN OSA ASSIGNMENT WILL HAVE
    POST-OSA CHOICE OF COAST DETAILING FOR THEIR FOLLOW-ON PCS ORDERS 
NEGOTIATION.  IF THE SAILOR IS TAKING A SEA DUTY BILLET FOLLOWING THEIR 
OSA DEPLOYMENT, THE RATING DETAILER WILL STRIVE TO DETAIL MEMBERS TO 
UNITS NOT DEPLOYING IMMEDIATELY WHENEVER POSSIBLE, WITH RESPECT TO THE 
MEMBER'S DESIRES FOR BILLET AND LOCATION.
    D.  DWELL/ITEMPO.
       (1) EXECUTION OF OSA ORDERS.  SAILORS WHO OPT FOR OSA DEPLOYMENT 
WILL BE CONSIDERED VOLUNTEERS FOR THOSE ORDERS, AND WILL AUTOMATICALLY 
BE WAIVED FOR DWELL/ITEMPO REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED IN OPNAVINST 3000.13C.
       (2) POST OSA DEPLOYMENTS.  SAILORS WHO HAVE FOLLOW-ON SEA DUTY 
ORDERS SUBSEQUENT TO AN OSA DEPLOYMENT WILL BE CONSIDERED VOLUNTEERS FOR 
THOSE ORDERS AND WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE WAIVED FOR DWELL/ITEMPO 
REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED IN OPNAVINST 3000.13C.
    E.  OSA DEPLOYMENTS WILL BE CONSIDERED A VOLUNTARY CONTINUATION OF 
CURRENT TYPE DUTY AND FOLLOW-ON TOURS WILL BE SET BASED ON NORMAL 
SEA/SHORE TOUR LENGTHS.

5.  WHILE EVERY EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO EXECUTE OSA, GSA AND IAMM 
BUSINESS RULES AS PUBLISHED  IN NAVADMINS, THERE WILL BE CIRCUMSTANCES 
WHICH CANNOT BE  ANTICIPATED.  THE NAVY IS COMMITTED TO FINDING THE BEST 
BALANCE BETWEEN THE IA MISSION, NEEDS/DESIRES OF THE SAILOR, AND COMMAND 
READINESS.  UNANTICIPATED DEMANDS MAY REQUIRE TAILORED SOLUTIONS NOT 
COVERED IN CURRENT BUSINESS RULES.

6.  YOUR EFFORTS REMAIN CRITICAL TO ENSURING NAVY PROVIDES THE RIGHT 
SAILOR WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS AT THE RIGHT TIME TO MEET OUR NATION'S OCO 
REQUIREMENTS.  I AM PROUD OF THE WORK BEING DONE BY OUR IA SAILORS AND 
THANK EACH OF YOU FOR THE SUPPORT YOU CONTINUE TO GIVE THIS EFFORT EVERY 
DAY.
