9.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a continuation selection 
board via the letter to the board (LTB) process.  NAVADMIN
220/19 announced the introduction of a new application known as Electronic 
Submission of Selection Board Documents (ESSBD), accessible through MyNavy 
Portal.  ESSBD improves the speed, transparency and confidence of receipt 
over current LTB submission methods, such as hard copy and e-mail submitted 
letters and related attachments.
    a.  Beginning 1 January 2020, ESSBD will be available for all promotion, 
advancement and selection boards.
    b.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to electronically 
submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without attachments and 
will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) exactly what will 
be delivered and presented to the board.
    c.  To utilize ESSBD, candidates must access document services through 
MyNavy Portal at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record.
On-screen instructions will direct the submitter thereafter.
    d.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted.  If required, a full visual user 
guide is available through MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion.
    e.  LTBs submitted to statutory officer continuation selection boards 
must be received by Navy Personnel Command (NAVPERSCOM) no later than 2359 
(central time) 10 days prior to the convening date of the respective board.  
Submitters are cautioned to not wait until the deadline date to submit LTBs 
via ESSBD or other available avenues.
    f.  If sending a board package from a non-NMCI network (bumed.mil, 
eu.navy.mil, etc.), please review procedures listed in NAVADMIN 220/19.
    g.  The written communication may call attention to the board, any matter 
concerning the record of the officer that the officer considers important.  
Written communication may include, as enclosures, correspondence from any 
individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not originated by 
the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of the eligible 
officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must contain a written 
acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she desires such 
correspondence be presented to the board.
Correspondence without such an acknowledgement is considered third party 
correspondence and will be returned without being presented to the board.  
Classified correspondence will not be accepted.

10.  Questions regarding LTB submission should be directed to MyNavy Career 
Center by calling 1 (833) 330-MNCC (1 (833) 330-6622/DSN 882).

11.  Questions regarding continuation should be directed to NAVPERSCOM PERS-
801 at (901) 874-4533/DSN 882.  Additional information is also available via 
MyNavy Portal at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/p-
officer-promotion-resources-and-links, then click on the Websites side (vice 
Systems side) of the blue header.  Once on the Websites side, you will see 
the NPC Promotion Boards link.  Click on the NPC Promotion Boards link, then
