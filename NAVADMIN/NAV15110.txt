SUBJ/FY-15 AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD RETENTION BONUS PROGRAM//

MSGID/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/N1/MAY//

RMKS/1.  This announces the FY-15 Aviation Department Head Retention Bonus 
(ADHRB) Program for the active component.  A vital part of developing a total 
force strategy and maintaining combat readiness is to provide appropriate 
incentives to retain skilled personnel for critical naval aviation enterprise 
billets.  The Aviation Career Continuation Pay (ACCP) program (of which the 
ADHRB is a subset) incentivizes talented, hard-working, career-minded Naval 
Aviators and Naval Flight Officers (NFO) to choose to remain on active duty. 
Our return on investment is the retention for continued Navy service of our 
aviation warfighters, with their invaluable and truly irreplaceable skill 
sets and capacity for leadership.

2.  The FY-15 Aviation Department Head Retention Bonus offers the following 
community-specific bonus amounts:
HM Pilot       $75,000
HSC Pilot      $75,000
HSL/HSM Pilot  $75,000
VAQ Pilot     $125,000    VAQ NFO     $100,000
VAW/VRC Pilot $125,000    VAW NFO      $75,000
VFA Pilot     $125,000    VFA NFO      $75,000
VP/VQ(P) Pilot $75,000    VP/VQ(P) NFO $75,000
VQ(T) Pilot    $75,000    VQ(T) NFO   $100,000

3.  Aviation officers designated 1310 or 1320 are eligible if their active 
duty service obligation (ADSO) for undergraduate flight training expires in 
FY-15 or FY-16.  Payment will begin when the officer is within one year of 
completion of the ADSO.  All ADHRB contracts incur a five-year service 
obligation beginning at ADSO expiry or at contract approval date, whichever 
is later.

4.  Officers accepting ACCP contracts are not precluded from participating in 
the Career Intermission Pilot Program (CIPP). Officers interested in both 
ACCP and CIPP should contact the ACCP program manager and their detailer for 
more specifics.

5.  FY-15 ACCP applications must be received prior to 31 August 2015.
