RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits nominations for the Fiscal Year 2021 Language 
Professional of the Year (LPOY), Command Language Program of the Year (CLPOY)

Award for Language Professional Excellence* in honor of Senior Chief 
Cryptologic Technician Interpretive (CTI) Shannon M. Kent, killed in action 
on 16 January 2019 in Manbij, Syria.  Awarded the 2010 Navy LPOY award as a 
petty officer first class, Senior Chief Kent was recognized as an outstanding 
language analyst whose unparalleled language proficiency, cultural knowledge, 
technical acumen and leadership proved paramount to the success of critical 
warfare missions in support of overseas contingency operations.  Later that 
year, she competed for and won the Department of Defense (DoD) LPOY award. 
 
2.  Each year, the Navy recognizes the most outstanding Command Language 
Program (CLP), military and civilian language professionals and non-career 
linguists contributing to mission success through the use of foreign 
language.  The top Navy CLP and the winner of the Shannon M. Kent Award for 
Language Professional Excellence will go on to compete at the DoD level.  The 
DoD program is managed by the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language 
Center and recognizes the most outstanding military language professionals 
(E-6 and below) and CLPs across the military services.

    a.  CLPOY:  Established by Chief of Naval Operations as an annual 
recognition of the top Navy CLP.

language and culture page under career management.  In line with reference

to OPNAV N13F (ALTN_N13F1(at)navy.mil).  Packages without an endorsement from 
the type commanders (or equivalent command) will not be considered.  Due to 
processing delays of traditional mail, hardcopy packages are not desired. 
 
6.  Deadline.  All nomination packages must be received no later than 31 
March 2022 to be considered.
