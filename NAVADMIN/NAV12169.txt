SUBJ/NAVY FITNESS INTRODUCES THE NAVY OPERATIONAL FITNESS AND FUELING SERIES 
IPHONE APP//

RMKS/1. THE NAVY OPERATIONAL FITNESS AND FUELING SERIES (NOFFS) PROVIDES THE 
NAVY WITH "BEST IN CLASS" PHYSICAL FITNESS AND NUTRITION INFORMATION FOR 
SAILORS. THE NOFFS PROGRAM WILL ASSIST IN MAINTAINING PEAK PHYSICAL READINESS, 
HONE THE MOST EFFECTIVE NAVAL FORCE IN HISTORY AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE 
THEME OF OUR 21ST CENTURY SAILOR AND MARINE INITIATIVE. NOFFS PROVIDES SAILORS 
WITH AN EVIDENCE-BASED PERFORMANCE TOOL THAT WILL ADDRESS INJURY PREVENTION BY 
PHYSICALLY TRAINING THE MOVEMENT PATTERNS OF OPERATIONAL TASKS. THE NOFFS 
IPHONE APP PROVIDES THE COMPLETE NOFFS PROGRAM IN A CONVENIENT FORMAT THAT IS 
READILY ACCESSIBLE TO SAILORS AND PORTABLE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, ALLOWING OUR 
NAVY TO MAINTAIN PEAK PHYSICAL READINESS CONDITION REGARDLESS OF ENVIRONMENT 
OR LOCATION.

2. THE NOFFS IPHONE APP, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED AS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN 
COMMANDER NAVY INSTALLATIONS COMMAND (CNIC) NAVY FITNESS TEAM, CENTER FOR 
PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CPPD), AND ATHLETES' PERFORMANCE 
INSTITUTE (API), PROVIDES THE NAVY THE SAME FUNCTIONALITY AND CALIBER OF 
PROGRAM DESIGN USED BY PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES. THE PROGRAM CAN BE TAILORED TO 
ANY ENVIRONMENT OR FITNESS LEVEL, ALLOWING ALL SAILORS TO BENEFIT FROM THE 
PROGRAM. THE NOFFS APP OFFERS SAILORS A COMPLETE AND COMPREHENSIVE FITNESS 
PROGRAM. THE ENTIRE MOVEMENT LIBRARY, VIRTUAL TRAINER, VIRTUAL MEAL BUILDER 
AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS ARE INCLUDED. ALL EXERCISES ARE ILLUSTRATED 
CLEARLY WITH PROFESSIONAL PHOTOS, DETAILED PERFORMANCE INSTRUCTIONS AND VIDEO 
DEMONSTRATIONS.
EXERCISE SESSIONS CAN BE TAILORED TO THE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT, AVAILABLE 
TOOLS, AND TIME RESTRICTIONS. NUTRITION GUIDANCE IS ALSO AVAILABLE THROUGH THE 
VIRTUAL MEAL BUILDER FEATURE OF THE APP.

3. AS WITH ANY FITNESS PROGRAM THERE IS A RISK OF INJURY, BUT THE NOFFS 
PROGRAM WAS BUILT WITH INJURY PREVENTION AS A PRIMARY DEVELOPMENT FACTOR AND 
USES PROVEN INJURY PREVENTION AND PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT EXERCISES THAT WERE 
SELECTED SPECIFICALLY TO MIMIC THE DAILY ACTIVITIES OF SAILORS.

4. THE NOFFS IPHONE APP IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD FROM THE APP STORE FOR 
IPHONE AND ITOUCH. THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED IN OTHER SOFTWARE 
PACKAGES AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR WINDOWS AND ANDROID BASED SMART PHONES AT A 
LATER DATE. THE PROGRAM IS, HOWEVER, AVAILABLE VIA THE NOFFS WEBSITE LOCATED 
AT WWW.NAVYFITNESS.ORG/NOFFS AND CAN BE DOWNLOADED IN ITS ENTIRETY TO ANY 
COMPUTER AND REPRODUCED IN HARD COPY.

5. IT IS THE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY SAILOR TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL 
OF PHYSICAL FITNESS. THE NAVY OPERATIONAL FITNESS AND FUELING SERIES CAN BE 
USED TO ASSIST SAILORS IN MEETING THEIR  PHYSICAL FITNESS GOALS ANYTIME, 
ANYWHERE. I ENCOURAGE ALL SAILORS TO CONSIDER INCORPORATING THE NAVY 
OPERATIONAL FITNESS AND FUELING SERIES INTO THEIR PHYSICAL FITNESS ROUTINE AS 
WE STRIVE TO KEEP OUR NAVY IN TOP PHYSICAL CONDITION.
