AMPN/REF A IS NAVADMIN 226/12, CHANGES IN ENLISTED DISTRIBUTION TO IMPROVE SEA 
DUTY MANNING.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN, IN CONJUNCTION WITH REF A AND EFFORTS TO ADDRESS 
SHORT-TERM MANNING ISSUES IN OUR DEPLOYING FORCES, ANNOUNCES THE LIMITED 
DIRECTED DETAILING PROGRAM WHICH WILL ALLOW THE REASSIGNMENT OF SAILORS ON 
SHORE DUTY WHO HAVE CRITICAL SKILLS REQUIRED BY OUR IMMINENT DEPLOYERS TO SEA 
DUTY.  THIS ACTION IS EXPECTED TO IMPACT BETWEEN 200 AND 400 SAILORS NAVY 
WIDE.

2.  SAILORS WHO HAVE COMPLETED A MINIMUM OF 24 MONTHS ON SHORE DUTY AT THE 
TIME OF ORDER EXECUTION MAY BE CONTACTED BY THEIR DETAILER AND DIRECTED TO A 
SEA DUTY ASSIGNMENT PRIOR TO THEIR PROJECTED ROTATION DATE (PRD).  DIRECT 
DETAILED SAILORS WILL BE FINANCIALLY COMPENSATED IN A LUMP SUM, CALCULATED 
ACCORDING TO MONTHS OF SHORE DUTY CURTAILED.

3.  LIMITED DIRECTED DETAILING WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED AS FOLLOWS:
    A.  TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF DIRECT DETAILED SAILORS, DETAILERS WILL FILL 
AS MANY OF THE CRITICAL JOBS AS POSSIBLE BY FULLY UTILIZING THE  AUTHORIZED 
TRANSFER WINDOW THAT INCLUDES MOVING SAILORS THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO, OR FOUR 
MONTHS BEYOND, THEIR PRD MONTH.  THIS IS THE NORMAL AUTHORIZED DETAILING 
WINDOW, IT IS NOT CONSIDERED DIRECTED DETAILING AND WILL NOT RESULT IN 
ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL COMPENSATION.
    B.  DETAILERS WILL COMPILE A LIST OF SHORE DUTY SAILORS BASED ON SHORE 
DUTY COMMENCEMENT DATE, SAILORS THAT HAVE BEEN ON SHORE DUTY THE LONGEST WILL 
GENERALLY BE UTILIZED FIRST AND GEOGRAPHIC STABILITY WILL BE MAINTAINED 
WHENEVER POSSIBLE.  SAILORS THAT ALREADY POSSESS A REQUIRED NEC WILL BE CHOSEN 
UNLESS TRAINING IS AVAILABLE AND CAN BE COMPLETED PRIOR TO THE REQUIRED 
REPORTING DATE.
    C.  NO SHORE COMMANDS OR SPECIFIC JOBS ARE EXEMPT FROM LIMITED DIRECTED 
DETAILING.  HOWEVER, SAILORS CURRENTLY FILLING THE FOLLOWING BILLETS OR AT THE 
FOLLOWING COMMANDS WILL ONLY BE CONSIDERED AFTER ALL OTHERS:  RECRUIT DIVISION 
COMMANDER; ATTACH, RECRUITERS AND INSTRUCTORS, CAMP DAVID, STATE DEPARTMENT, 
SPECWAR AND SPECOPS SHORE COMMANDS, AND AFLOAT TRAINING GROUPS.  SAILORS WITH 
A NUCLEAR NEC (33XX) WILL CONTINUE TO BE DETAILED PER NAVAL NUCLEAR PROPULSION 
PROGRAM PRIORITIES.
    D.  ONCE A SAILOR IS IDENTIFIED TO FILL A CRITICAL JOB THAT REQUIRES SHORE 
DUTY CURTAILMENT, BOTH THE LOSING COMMAND AND THE SAILOR WILL BE CONTACTED BY 
PERS-40.  PERS-4 WILL BE THE FLAG REVIEW AUTHORITY FOR ANY COMMAND REQUESTING 
FLAG REVIEW.
    E.  HIGH YEAR TENURE (HYT) WAIVERS FOR PURPOSES OF COMPLETING DEPLOYMENTS 
WILL BE APPROVED AND PRD WILL BE SET TO THE PRESCRIBED SEA TOUR (PST) BASED ON 
THE SAILOR'S SEA SHORE FLOW REQUIREMENT.
    F.  UPON RECEIPT OF ORDERS, FINANCIAL COMPENSATION WILL BE PAID IN THE 
FORM OF A LUMP SUM PAYMENT.  SAILORS WHO ARE UNABLE TO EXECUTE THEIR ORDERS 
WILL HAVE THEIR FINANCIAL COMPENSATION RECOUPED.

4.  DECISIONS AFFECTING THE CAREERS AND LIVES OF OUR SAILORS AND THEIR 
FAMILIES ARE NOT TAKEN LIGHTLY.  OUR AIM IS TO CAUSE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF 
DISRUPTION TO THE CAREERS OF OUR SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES, WHILE SUSTAINING 
FLEET MANNING AND ENSURING OUR NAVY REMAINS MISSION READY ACROSS THE BROAD 
SPECTRUM OF MARITIME OPERATIONS.  LIMITED DIRECTED DETAILING IS MEANT TO BE AN 
INTERIM POLICY TO IMPROVE FLEET MANNING AND READINESS BY FILLING THE CRITICAL 
GAPS WE ARE EXPERIENCING AT SEA WITH THE RIGHT SAILORS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
EVALUATE THIS POLICY, ADJUST AS NECESSARY, AND REFINE LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS 
THAT WILL HELP PROPERLY MAN THE NAVY AT SEA AND ON SHORE.
