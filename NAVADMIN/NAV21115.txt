NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 332/20, EXPANDED OPERATIONAL STRESS CONTROL. 
REF B IS NAVADMIN 222/19, OPERATIONAL STRESS CONTROL POLICY UPDATE. 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN details the training plan for Expanded Operational 
Stress Control (E-OSC) Team Leads (TL) and Assistant Team Leads (ATL) from 6 
July through 9 December 2021 as part of the phased roll-out of the E-OSC 
Program announced in reference (a). 
 
2.  Background. In October 2019, reference (b) introduced E-OSC, as a  
peer-to-peer, primary prevention program designed to improve the way Service 
Members think about and respond to challenging situation in their life like 
relationships, career transitions, disciplinary/legal issues, performance 
issues and financial strain. 
E-OSC was developed by the Naval Center for Combat and Operational Stress 
Control (NCCOSC) in concert with the Navy 21st Century Sailor Office (OPNAV 
N17) and combines the principles of OSC with Mind, Body and Resilience 
Training and key programmatic capacities to evaluate and mitigate areas of 
decreased resilience within the command.  E-OSC will leverage Command 
Resilience Teams (CRTs) and Engaged Deckplate Leaders (EDLs) to provide more 
accessible, collaborative resources and real-time assessments of unit culture 
to promote healthy command climates.  Reference (a) introduced a phased roll 
out of E-OSC.  The phased plan included a pilot program which is currently 
being conducted, introduction of a requirement to include a command 
indoctrination video on E-OSC implemented in January 2020 and a training plan 
for E-OSC TLs and ATLs.  E-OSC will be implemented across the Navy in January 
2022. 
 
3.  Implementation 
    (a)  In accordance to ref (a), each command must appoint an E-OSC TL (E7 
or above) and an E-OSC ATL (E6 or above) with at least one year left at the 
command.  Commands with a civilian population larger than 60 percent of the 
command may consider appointing a civilian (GS-11 or higher) as TL or ATL, 
however, whenever possible at least one of the two should be a uniformed 
member.  Larger commands can appoint additional ATLs to meet the needs of 
their command (a recommended standard is one ATL per department). 
Commands, however, should not appoint medical or mental health staff as TLs 
or ATLs in order to reinforce the peer-to-peer nature of the program.  For 
medical commands, Caregiver Occupational Stress Control instructors meet the 
requirements for E-OSC Instructors. 
Once appointed, the TL will become a member of the CRT.  TLs and ATLs are 
required to attend two and a half days of virtual training. Upon completion 
of training, TLs and ATLs will be responsible for training and implementing 
E-OSC at the command level under the direction of the command triad. 
    (b)  Training for E-OSC TLs and ATLs will begin on 6 July 2021 and run 
through 9 December 2021.  OPNAV N17 will conduct 10 virtual training sessions 
across multiple time zones each week with a maximum capacity of 25 
participants per course.  Participants must use a computer with audio/video 
capability.  Participants will be provided access information upon 
registration.  The current course schedule includes sufficient billets for 
all commands to be trained by 9 December.  Training opportunities, though 
numerous, are limited; and proactive enrollment early in the process will 
prevent commands from competing for more limited training opportunities 
later in the rollout.  Upon completion of the training the command is 
responsible to enter completion data into FLTMPS, using:  E-OSC Instructor 
Trainer Course, CIN:  E-OSC-IT-001. 
    (c) Upon completion of training, TLs and ATLs should begin implementing 
the elements of the E-OSC program at their command.  In accordance with 
reference (a), implementation is required by January 2022.  Commands with 
fewer than 30 members may consider rolling up E-OSC implementation and 
execution responsibilities into their next higher echelon to meet the E-OSC 
requirement. 
    (d)  TLs and ATLs should register for E-OSC training at the following 
link:  https://esportal.med.navy.mil/bumed/rh/m3/m33/nccosc/activity/center 
/index.aspx 
    (e)  The E-OSC Support Center hosted by NCCOSC is a CAC enabled site for 
use by TLs and ATLs.  The site will provide updated curriculum, access to 
video resources, and additional information to keep E-OSC training teams 
current and supported.  The E-OSC Support 
Center is located at: 
https://esportal.med.navy.mil/bumed/rh/m3/m33/nccosc/programs/e- 
osc/supportcenter/index.aspx.

or daryl.charles(at)navy.mil. 
 
5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
