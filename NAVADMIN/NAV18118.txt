RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces comprehensive policy and process changes to 
the enlisted Professional Apprenticeship Career Track (PACT) Program outlined 
in reference (a).  These modifications to the PACT program create 
efficiencies in the Fleet manning process by directly linking the designation 
process to job requirements.  The participation of PACT Sailors and their 
chains of command will be fundamental keys for success.  Changes to the PACT 
program provide for a distinct targeted apprenticeship tour with a well-
defined designation window and reduced variability in Fleet losses.

2.  Policy changes.  The policy changes outlined below greatly benefit our 
PACT Sailors by allowing them to play an active role in deciding what is best 
for their careers by communicating directly with their detailers and Enlisted 
Community Managers (ECM).  This direct link will enable a more effective and 
dynamic determination of rating designation qualification and assignment to 
prioritized jobs based on the abilities and desires of the Sailors.  Updates 
to reference (a) are forthcoming.
    a.  Designation process changes.  Effective 1 June 2018, PACT Sailors 
will be designated based on their selection of a prioritized job in a rating 
for which they are qualified.  Twelve months prior to the projected rotation 
date (PRD) of the PACT Sailor, they may begin the designation and assignment 
selection process.  As outlined in reference (a), PACT Sailor PRDs are set at 
24 months from arrival at their first permanent duty station.
    b.  ECMs, working closely with detailers and command career counselors 
(CCC), will begin designating PACT Sailors starting with those who have been 
in the PACT program the longest.  Commands will continue to use the Career 
Waypoints-PACT (C-WAY-PACT) Designation module for applications.  The use of 
C-WAY as a means for PACT designation will be phased out over time as an 
updated Information Technology (IT) solution will be implemented using Career 
Management System Interactive Detailing (CMS-ID).  Until an IT solution is 
fully implemented, ECMs will continue to retrieve PACT designation 
applications from C-WAY and will directly interface with commands, PACT 
Sailors and detailers.  This link http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/enlisted/community/pact/Pages/default.aspx provides an overview of the 
new designation and assignment procedures and will be updated regularly as 
required.
    c.  PACT Sailors willing to obligate service to complete the sea tour for 
their new rating, or a minimum 24 months of additional sea time, whichever is 
greater, may be authorized immediate advancement to E4 with commanding 
officer approval.

3.  PACT Sailors must ensure their training records and qualifications are 
up-to-date to facilitate the order negotiation process.  PACT Sailors 
interested in expanding their available conversion opportunities should 
contact their CCC for more information on retaking the Armed Services 
Vocational Aptitude Battery.

4.  As outlined in references (b) and (c), command leadership engagement is 
critical to the success of PACT program implementation, and to ensure viable 
career path for PACT Sailors.
Our PACT Sailors are entirely dependent on strong leadership and purposeful 
mentorship to ensure they have every opportunity to reach their maximum 
potential and to best meet the needs of the Navy.

5.  Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) policy reminder.  Once designated, 
eligible PACT Sailors may be eligible for SRB.  Check the latest SRB NAVADMIN 
for eligibility determination.

6.  Points of contact:
    a.  NAVPERSCOM Customer Service Center at 1-866-827-5672 (U-ASK- NPC).
    b.  PACT Program Manager, BUPERS-3, at (901) 874-3096/DSN 882.

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled.
