3.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a promotion 
selection board via the Letter to the Board (LTB) process.  NAVADMIN 
220/19 announced the introduction of a new application known as 
Electronic Submission of Selection Board Documents (ESSBD), 
accessible through MyNavy Portal (MNP).  ESSBD improves the speed, 
transparency, and confidence of receipt over current LTB submission 
methods, such as hard copy and e-mail submitted letters and related 
attachments. 
    a.  ESSBD will be available for all promotion, advancement and 
selection boards. 
    b.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to 
electronically submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or 
without attachments, and will allow the candidate to see (for 
content and clarity) exactly what will be delivered and presented to 
the board. 
    c.  To use ESSBD, candidates must access document services 
through MNP at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record.  On-screen 
instructions will direct the submitter thereafter. 
    d.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs 
submitted via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation 
of eligibility for the boards to which LTBs are submitted.  If 
required, a full visual user guide is available 
athttps://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion. 
    e.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command not later 
than 2359 (central time) 10 days prior to the convening date of the 
board.  Submitters are cautioned to not wait until the deadline date 
to submit LTBs via ESSBD or other available avenues. 
Selection To                      Convening Date  Due Date / Time 
Rear Admiral (lower half) (JAGC)  11 MAY 22      30 APR 22 / 2359 CT 
    f.  If sending a board package from a non-NMCI network 
(bumed.mil, eu.navy.mil, etc.), please review procedures listed in 
NAVADMIN 220/19. 
    g.  The written communication may call attention to the board 
any matter concerning the record of the officer that the officer 
considers important.  Written communication may include, as 
enclosures, correspondence from any individual concerning the 
eligible officer.  Correspondence not originated by the eligible 
officer, including endorsement to the letter of the eligible officer 
and letters written on behalf of that officer, must contain a 
written acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she 
desires such correspondence be presented to the board. 
Correspondence without such an acknowledgement is considered third- 
party correspondence and will be returned without being presented to 
the board.  Classified correspondence will not be accepted. 
 
4.  All officers are reminded it is their responsibility to ensure 
their personnel records are accurate and complete.
