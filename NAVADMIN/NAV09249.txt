SUBJ/ENHANCED CAREER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - INTERACTIVE DETAILING// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES ENHANCEMENTS TO THE ENLISTED DETAILING 
PROCESS AND THE CAREER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - INTERACTIVE DETAILING 
(CMS/ID).  CMS/ID IS A VITAL PART OF THE NAVY'S EFFORTS TO PROVIDE 
TRANSPARENCY IN THE ENLISTED DETAILING PROCESS.  IT ENABLES A MORE 
DIRECT AND PERSONAL ROLE FOR SAILORS IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, 
AND DIRECTLY SUPPORTS FLEET READINESS BY REPRESENTING THE IMMEDIATE 
READINESS NEEDS OF THE NAVY.  THESE ENHANCEMENTS WILL ALLOW THE NAVY TO 
PRIORITIZE CRITICAL SHORTFALLS AND FILL THESE SHORTFALLS EARLIER AS 
SAILORS MOVE INTO THE DETAILING WINDOW.  THIS WILL ALSO ALLOW SAILORS 
AND THEIR FAMILIES TO PLAN THEIR NEXT MOVE EARLIER, PROVIDING GREATER 
STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY.  
2.  THE VISUAL APPEARANCE OF CMS/ID AND THE MECHANICS USED IN 
ADVERTISING AND SELECTION WILL ESSENTIALLY STAY THE SAME.  HOWEVER, 
EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 2009, THE ORGANIZATIONAL CONSTRUCT AND BUSINESS RULES 
WILL CHANGE AS FOLLOWS:  
    A.  AFTER A SHORT TRANSITION PERIOD DESCRIBED BELOW, THE SAILOR 
NEGOTIATION WINDOW WILL BE NINE TO SEVEN MONTHS PRIOR TO A SAILOR'S PRD, 
PROVIDING A 3-MONTH WINDOW TO NEGOTIATE FOR ORDERS BEFORE A SAILOR IS 
ELIGIBLE FOR A DIRECTED "NEEDS OF THE NAVY" ASSIGNMENT.  
THE EXCEPTION TO THIS WILL BE RESOLUTION OF RED ZONE REQUISITIONS AS 
EXPLAINED IN PARA 3D.  THIS CHANGE IS DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE MORE 
AGGRESSIVE PARTICIPATION BY SAILORS IN THE ORDERS NEGOTIATION PROCESS 
AND BETTER RESPONSIVENESS TO FLEET DEMANDS AND CURRENT GWOT SUPPORT 
ASSIGNMENT (GSA) RESOURCING DEADLINES.
        (1) SAILORS CURRENTLY IN THEIR NEGOTIATION WINDOW WILL NOT BE 
DISADVANTAGED BY THIS CHANGE.  DETAILERS WILL APPLY THE FOLLOWING 
ADJUSTMENTS TO ENSURE ALL APPLICANTS HAVE NO LESS THAN THREE MONTHS TO 
CONSIDER OPTIONS BEFORE BEING CONSIDERED FOR A DIRECTED ASSIGNMENT:
            (A) SAILORS WITH A PRD BETWEEN AUGUST 2009 AND JANUARY 2010 
WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY THIS CHANGE AND SHOULD ALREADY BE UNDER ORDERS OR 
COMMITTED TO SEPARATION.
            (B) SAILORS WITH A PRD BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2010 AND APRIL 2010 
WILL BE MANAGED AS IF THEIR "NEEDS OF THE NAVY" WINDOW BEGINS JANUARY 
2010.
            (C) SAILORS WITH A PRD OF MAY 2010 AND BEYOND WILL FALL 
UNDER THESE NEW RULES.  
            (D) CMS/ID DOES NOT ALLOW A SAILOR TO NEGOTIATE ORDERS 
WITHOUT PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) APPROVAL.  SAILORS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE 
PTS APPROVAL UNTIL 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO THEIR PRD WILL NEGOTIATE DIRECTLY 
WITH THEIR RATING DETAILER.  THESE SAILORS WILL BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE 
ORDERS FOR ONE MONTH PRIOR TO ENTERING THE "NEEDS OF THE NAVY" WINDOW.  
A SAILOR'S PTS APPLICATION AT THE 12 TO 15 MONTH POINT PRIOR TO EAOS OR 
PRD IS KEY TO GETTING A TIMELY PTS QUOTA, AND WILL PRESERVE A FULL 
THREE MONTH NEGOTIATION WINDOW. 
    B.  THE MANNING CONTROL AUTHORITIES (MCA) WILL USE CMS/ID TO 
ADVERTISE MORE REQUISITIONS EACH CYCLE, ALLOWING FOR A GREATER NUMBER 
OF PRIORITY READINESS REQUISITIONS TO BE DISPLAYED AND PROVIDING 
SAILORS WITH MORE CHOICE AND SELECTIVITY.
    C.  THE MAJORITY OF THE REQUISITIONS WILL BE DISPLAYED IN THE GREEN 
ZONE.  GSA REQUISITIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE DISPLAYED IN THE PURPLE 
ZONE.  A MAJOR ENHANCEMENT, THE RED ZONE, WILL NOW DISPLAY THE MOST 
CRITICAL READINESS DEGRADING REQUISITIONS, AS DETERMINED BY THE MCA'S.
    D.  THE NEW RED ZONE WILL LIST REQUISITIONS NECESSARY FOR FLEET 
PERSONNEL READINESS.  IF NOT FILLED, THEY WILL DIRECTLY DEGRADE THE 
MISSION CAPABILITY OF A DEPLOYING UNIT, OPERATIONAL SUPPORT 
ORGANIZATION OR TRAINING COMMAND.  NPC WILL FILL EVERY RED ZONE 
REQUISITION EVERY MONTH, AND ALL SAILORS IN THE NEGOTIATING WINDOW (PRD 
MINUS 9 MONTHS) WILL BE CONSIDERED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR 
ASSIGNMENT,PERHAPS INVOLUNTARILY, TO RED ZONE REQUISITIONS.  THESE 
PRIORITY REQUISITIONS WILL BE IDENTIFIED EACH MONTH BY THE MCA, AND THE 
NUMBER OF RED ZONE REQUISITIONS WILL NOT EXCEED TWO PER RATE (E.G., TWO 
YN3, TWO YN2, TWO YN1, ETC) FOR BOTH SEA AND SHORE REQUISITIONS.  
DETAILERS WILL IDENTIFY SAILORS FOR ASSIGNMENT TO CRITICAL RED ZONE 
REQUIREMENTS USING THE FOLLOWING PRIORITIES:
        (1) FIRST PRIORITY - VOLUNTEERS.
        (2) SECOND PRIORITY - SAILORS WHO ARE AVAILABLE FOR IMMEDIATE 
ASSIGNMENT.  GENERALLY, THESE ARE SAILORS RETURNING TO FULL DUTY FROM 
LIMITED DUTY, OR SAILORS WHOSE CURRENT ASSIGNMENT HAS BEEN CURTAILED 
FOR SOME REASON.
        (3) THIRD PRIORITY - SAILORS WHO ARE UNASSIGNED AND WHO ARE 
WITHIN THEIR "NEEDS OF THE NAVY" WINDOW (PRD MINUS 6 MONTHS).
        (4) FOURTH PRIORITY - SAILORS WHO ARE WITHIN 9 MONTHS OF THEIR 
PRD.  THESE SAILORS WILL BE FURTHER CATEGORIZED BY PRD MONTH, STARTING 
WITH THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN IN THEIR NEGOTIATION WINDOW THE LONGEST.  
INVOLUNTARY ASSIGNMENTS OF SAILORS FROM WITHIN THIS CATEGORY WILL BE 
MADE ONLY WITH PERS-40 DIVISION DIRECTOR APPROVAL.  SAILORS SELECTED 
FOR INVOLUNTARY ASSIGNMENT WILL BE AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL 
THAT SELECTION TO PERS-4 VIA THEIR CHAIN OF COMMAND FOR FLAG LEVEL 
REVIEW.  
3.  THE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED ENHANCEMENTS THAT ENABLE SAILORS TO ACCESS 
AND APPLY TO CMS/ID VIA THEIR HOME COMPUTERS HAVE MADE THIS VITAL 
COMPONENT OF THE ENLISTED ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM MORE READILY AVAILABLE.  
THE IMPROVEMENTS DISCUSSED IN THIS NAVADMIN WILL MAKE CMS/ID MORE AGILE, 
MORE RESPONSIVE TO NEW/CHANGING FLEET REQUIREMENTS, AND MORE DYNAMIC IN 
EXECUTION.  IN AGGREGATE, THESE INITIATIVES OFFER ADVANTAGES TO BOTH 
OUR SAILORS AND THE COMMANDS WHERE THEY SERVE, AND BETTER POSITION THE 
NAVY AND OUR PEOPLE FOR SUCCESS IN NAVAL OPERATIONS WORLD-WIDE.
4.  QUESTIONS CONCERNING CMS/ID AND THIS MOST RECENT UPGRADE SHOULD BE 
REFERRED TO THE NPC CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER, (866)-U-ASK-NPC OR
(866) 827-5672, OR EMAIL AT CSCMAILBOX(AT)NAVY.MIL.  THIS CUSTOMER 
SERVICE CENTER IS MANNED MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY, 0700 TO 1900, CENTRAL 
STANDARD TIME.
