RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the winners of the 2018 Chief of Naval 
Operations, Naval History Essay Contest.

2.  Per reference (a), Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) requested submissions 
for the 2018 CNO Naval History Essay Contest to further our understanding of 
how lessons from history inform our way ahead.  Entrants submitted 182 essays 
- 13 in the Professional Historian category and 169 in the Rising Historian 
category.  Moreover, the exceptional quality of the essays made judging very 
difficult.  I would like to extend my appreciation to all who submitted 
essays.  We will be working to find the best avenues to publish not just the 
winners, but also many more of these quality essays.  I would like to extend 
my thanks to the United States Naval Institute (USNI) for assisting with the 
contest.
Congratulations to all of the winners, whom I look forward to meeting in 
person at the awards reception.
