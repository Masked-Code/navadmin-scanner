SUBJ/OBSERVANCE OF HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 2012//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE OBSERVANCE OF HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
FROM 15 SEPTEMBER TO 15 OCTOBER 2012.  THE NATIONAL THEME FOR THIS YEAR IS 
"DIVERSITY UNITED, BUILDING AMERICA'S FUTURE TODAY", CELEBRATING THE 
GENERATIONS OF HISPANIC AMERICANS WHO HAVE INFLUENCED AND ENRICHED OUR NATION.

2.  HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH TRACES ITS ORIGINS TO SEPTEMBER 1968, WHEN 
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON PROCLAIMED A NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE WEEK.  THE 
WEEK WAS EXPANDED IN 1988 BY PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN TO INCLUDE A MONTH-LONG 
CELEBRATION HONORING THE HISTORIES, CULTURES, AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF AMERICANS 
WHO TRACE THEIR ROOTS TO SPAIN, MEXICO, THE CARIBBEAN, AND CENTRAL AND SOUTH 
AMERICA.

3.  THE STRENGTH OF OUR NAVY AND NATION IS DERIVED FROM THE DIVERSITY OF OUR 
PEOPLE AND HISPANIC SAILORS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN OUR NAVY. TODAY, NEARLY 
50,000 HISPANIC SAILORS AND OFFICERS SERVE IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY, 
PARTICIPATING IN EVERY FACET OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.  FOUR HISPANIC ADMIRALS AND 
172 HISPANIC MASTER CHIEFS LEAD OUR NAVY FROM THE FRONT, PROVIDING UNIQUE 
PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIENCES THAT ENHANCE OUR CULTURE AND IMPROVE OUR MISSION 
READINESS.

HISPANIC AMERICANS.  NOTABLE EXAMPLES INCLUDE JORGE ANTHONY MAGIN FARRAGUT, A 
NATIVE OF MINORCA AND AN AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR VETERAN WHO SERVED 
ADMIRABLY DURING THE WAR OF 1812.  JORGE ANTHONY MAGIN FARRAGUT WAS THE FATHER 
OF DAVID GLASGOW  FARRAGUT.  A CONGRESSIONAL ACT PASSED ON JULY 25, 1866, MADE 
DAVID GLASGOW FARRAGUT THE NAVY'S FIRST OFFICER TO ATTAIN THE RANK OF ADMIRAL.
DURING WORLD WAR II, NAVY PILOT EUGENE A. VALENCIA SHOT DOWN 23 ENEMY AIRCRAFT 
AND REMAINS THE NAVY'S THIRD RANKING ACE OF ALL TIME.  IN 1964, HORATIO RIVERO 
JR. BECAME THE FIRST HISPANIC VICE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.  HE WENT ON TO 
BECOME THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF ALLIED FORCES, SOUTHERN EUROPE AND IN 1979

HILDALGO BECAME THE FIRST HISPANIC SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.  IN 2001, WILLIAM A. 
NAVAS, A DECORATED COMBAT VETERAN OF THE VIETNAM WAR, WAS APPOINTED AND BECAME 
THE FIRST HISPANIC ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NAVY FOR MANPOWER AND RESERVE 
AFFAIRS.  IN 2006, JOE CAMPA BECAME THE FIRST HISPANIC MASTER CHIEF PETTY
