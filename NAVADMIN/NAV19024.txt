RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides additional reporting guidance when Defense 
Industrial Base (DIB) networks that contain Controlled Unclassified 
Information (CUI) have been attacked or compromised.
This NAVADMIN is effective immediately and shall remain in effect until the 
release of a revision to reference (a).

2.  Background.  DIB Networks and the CUI on them are vulnerable to external 
attack.  Malicious actors have demonstrated the ability to gain access to 
contractor and vendor networks for the purpose of extracting CUI.  Immediate 
reporting to cognizant activities is imperative to close the breach and 
inform leadership of the scope of the incident.

3.  Specific Reporting Instructions.  Cybersecurity incidents and attacks on 
Navy programmatic acquisition equities will be reported to senior Naval 
leadership via OPREP NAVY BLUE message.  Report criteria:  Attacks on USN 
contractor and vendor networks that result in the unauthorized access and 
acquisition of CUI.  Voice reports shall be made to the CNO Battle Watch team 
((703) 692-9284) in accordance with the guidelines in reference (a), chapter 
2, section 8, paragraph 2.

4.  Reporting Process.  Upon notification of a cybersecurity incident from 
the Defense Cyber Crimes Center (DC3), the Navy Damage Assessment Management 
Office (DAMO) shall submit the OPREP-3.  In addition to the commands listed 
on the message template in paragraph 6, DAMO may include any command that is 
deemed relevant.
The report must be generated within three business days of notification from 
the DC3.  DAMO should not delay due to lack of details.  DAMO will issue a 
close-out report upon completion of the final assessment.

5.  Report Content.  Timely and accurate reporting of cybersecurity incidents 
is critical to the response process.  In general, voice and record message 
reports shall address the following (if known):
    (1) What Happened (Including date of incident and method of discovery)
