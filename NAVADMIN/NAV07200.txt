NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 187/07.  REF B IS DRAFT CJCS INSTRUCTION 1330.05, 
JOINT OFFICER MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES.// RMKS/1.  THIS SECOND IN A SERIES 
OF NAVADMINS CONCERNING THE JOINT QUALIFICATION SYSTEM (JQS), (WHICH 
WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE 1 OCT 07), EXPLAINS PROCEDURES FOR SELF-
NOMINATION FOR JOINT CREDIT (REF A REFERS).
2.  MILITARY SERVICES ARE NOW ESTABLISHING PROCEDURES FOR IDENTIFYING 
OFFICERS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR JOINT QUALIFICATION (REF B REFERS).  
PRIORITY IS BEING GIVEN TO ACTIVE COMPONENT CAPTAINS WHO ARE IN-ZONE 
FOR THE FY-09 FLAG SELECTION BOARD WHICH CONVENES IN DEC 07, DUE TO 
MORE STRINGENT JOINT REQUIREMENTS FOR FLAG APPOINTMENT THAT WILL BE 
EFFECTIVE IN LATE 2008.  THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MAY GRANT 
EXCEPTIONS/WAIVERS (ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS) WHEN APPOINTMENT TO FLAG 
RANK ON A NON-JQS OFFICER IS NECESSARY FOR THE GOOD OF THE SERVICE OR 
WHERE THIS PROMOTION IS BASED ON SCIENTIFIC/TECHNICAL/ PROFESSIONAL 
QUALIFICATIONS (I.E., AP/ED/S&T COMMUNITIES) FOR WHICH JOINT 
REQUIREMENTS DO NOT EXIST.  THESE WAIVERS ARE LIKELY ONLY IN UNIQUE, 
EXCEPTIONAL CASES.  UNDER JQS, OFFICERS CAN SELF-NOMINATE, APPLYING 
THEIR EXPERIENCE-BASED JOINT DUTY ASSIGNMENTS (E-JDA) FOR POINT 
RECOGNITION, WHERE THEIR E-JDA IS RELEVANT TO THE JQS DEFINITION OF 
JOINT MATTERS.  THIS DEFINITION CAN BE FOUND IN THE JOINT NOMINATION 
CHECKLIST ON THE NPC JOINT OFFICER MATTERS WEBSITE:
HTTP://WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/OFFICERS/JOINTOFFICER.
3.  CAPTAINS WHO ARE ALREADY DESIGNATED AS JOINT SPECIALTY OFFICERS DO 
NOT HAVE TO SELF-NOMINATE.  THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE REDESIGNATED AS 
JOINT QUALIFIED OFFICERS ON 1 OCT 07.
4.  TO ASSIST THOSE ACTIVE COMPONENT CAPTAINS WHO WILL BE CONSIDERED 
FOR PROMOTION TO REAR ADMIRAL (LOWER HALF) BY THE FY-09 LINE AND STAFF 
BOARDS, WE INSTITUTED A MANUAL PAPER-BASED PROCESS WHEREBY A BOARD-
ELIGIBLE CAPTAIN CAN SELF-NOMINATE THOSE EXPERIENCES (E-JDA) FOR PRE-
VALIDATION ASSESSMENT BY NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (NPC).
5.  THIS PAPER-BASED SELF-NOMINATION PROCESS WILL BE OPEN TO CAPTAINS 
MEETING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:
    A.  ELIGIBLE FOR SELECTION TO O-7 BY THE FY-09 LINE OR STAFF BOARD.
    B.  HAVE A DATE OF RANK OF 1 OCT 05 OR EARLIER.
    C.  HAVE COMPLETED JOINT PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION (JPME) 
PHASES I AND II.
    D.  BE IN A COMMUNITY WHICH HAS JOINT OFFICER REQUIREMENTS, AND 
THAT HAS A POSSIBILITY OF  FLAG PICK  ON THE FY-09 BOARD.
    E.  BELIEVE THEY HAVE ACCRUED SUFFICIENT NON-JDAL JOINT EXPERIENCE 
TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FULL JOINT CREDIT UNDER JQS (SEE FACT SHEETS AND 
INFO PAPERS ON THE NPC JOINT OFFICER MATTERS WEBSITE:
WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/OFFICERS/JOINTOFFICER/).
6.  CAPTAINS MEETING THESE CRITERIA SHOULD VISIT THE JQS SELF- 
NOMINATION WEBPAGE ON THE NPC JOINT OFFICER MATTERS WEBSITE, DOWNLOAD, 
COMPLETE, AND SUBMIT THE SELF-NOMINATION CHECKLIST TO THEIR RESPECTIVE 
COMMUNITY POINT OF CONTACT LISTED ON PAGE 4 OF THE CHECKLIST.  ONCE NPC 
HAS ASSESSED AN INDIVIDUAL CAPTAIN S PACKAGE, IT WILL BE SENT TO THE 
JOINT STAFF FOR THEIR REVIEW AND JS FLAG- LEVEL ASSESSMENT.
