RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces a revision to the Special Duty Assignment 
Pay (SDAP) levels for the regular component, reserve component, Full Time 
Support and qualified selected reserve enlisted personnel on active duty and 
supersedes reference (a).  The SDAP program enhances the ability to size and 
stabilize our force by providing a monetary incentive to encourage enlisted 
personnel with specific designated skills to apply their knowledge and 
experience to uniquely challenging assignments.

2.  Increases to existing levels are effective 1 October 2017.  All changes 
to SDAP levels are shown in paragraph 6 for ease of reference.  A complete 
list of SDAP levels, new special duty assignments (SDA), and unit 
identification code revisions are provided at the following website:
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/Pages/SRB.aspx.  Commands are responsible to 
ensure changes are submitted via their local servicing personnel support 
detachments (PSD) or into the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System.

3.  Commanding officers are required to certify that Service Members meet all 
qualifying criteria established by references (b), (c) and this NAVADMIN 
prior to receiving SDAP.  Qualification criteria includes:  all 
qualifications completed, including personal qualification standards and 
under instruction watches, and assigned to and working in a billet on the 
enlisted distribution verification process identified as an SDA of the 
command.

4.  Each Sailor is eligible for only one SDAP entitlement at a time and, 
unless otherwise noted, commands must ensure the number of personnel 
receiving SDAP does not exceed the number of authorized SDAP billets.

5.  Commands holding SDAP billets are reminded that annual re-certification 
required by reference (b) begins in June.  Guidance for the re-certification 
process will be announced via separate correspondence.  Commands, via PSD if 
applicable, are responsible for making any rate adjustments as directed by 
this NAVADMIN.

6.  Summary of changes to SDAP levels:
Billet         Old Level    New Level    Billet Identification
9585/9587/     SD-5         SD-6         Production Recruiter
2187/2186

7.  Additional information on SDAP is located at 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/Pages/SRB.aspx.  However, skill specific 
questions should be directed to the appropriate enlisted community manager, 
which can be found on the Navy Personnel Command (NPC) website.  Commands and 
units unable to access the listed website should contact any of the listed 
points of contact to obtain the revised SDAP rates.  In addition, as navy 
enlisted classification (NEC) codes change under the new NEC construct, 
updates to the SDAP matrix will be reflected on the NPC website.
