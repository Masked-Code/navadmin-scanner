FOR ADVANCEMENT OF SELECTED RESERVE PERSONNEL TO E4 THROUGH E6.

THE U.S. NAVY AND U.S. NAVY RESERVE.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the update to reference (a) and Sailors in 
the MMA (Auxiliary) and MMW (Submarine Weapons) ratings accessed into the 
United States Navy Reserve.  In support of Reserve initiatives to retain 
talent and increase Reserve Component (RC) to Active Component (AC) 
permeability, MMA and MMW rated Sailors are no longer required to convert to 
the Machinist Mate (MM) rating when transitioning into the RC.  This change 
will allow these Sailors to maintain their critical skillsets and remain 
better aligned with the career paths of their AC counterparts, enhancing 
their ability to move between the Active and Reserve components.  
Accordingly, MMA and MMW candidates must take the appropriate exam that 
matches their specific rate.

2.  Educational Services Officers (ESO) should ensure that MMA exams are 
ordered for MMA candidates and MMW exams are ordered for MMW candidates.  
ESOs should contact Navy Education and Training Professional Development 
Center (NETPDC) to order exams for those Sailors whose initial exams were not 
ordered in the correct rate.
Exams shall be ordered via message or in message format via e-mail to 
sfly_N321_exam_order(at)navy.mil following the guidelines in chapter 4 of 
reference (b).  Ensure a point of contact is included in the message.  
Deadline to order additional selected reserve exams is 4 September 2018.

3.  Any additional information regarding this cycle will be posted on the 
Navy Enlisted Advancement System (NEAS) website.

4.  Points of contact:
    a.  Navy Personnel Command Customer Service Center:  866-U-ASK- NPC, or 
via e-mail at uasknpc(at)navy.mil.
    b.  SCI exam questions and orders: (850) 473-5867/DSN 753, or via e-mail 
at sfly_cryptologic.products(at)navy.mil.
    c.  Exam orders, records, and discrepancies:  (850) 473-6148/DSN 753, or 
via e-mail at sfly_N321_exam_order(at)navy.mil, or

5.  Retain this NAVADMIN until policy changes are incorporated in reference 
(b), superseded or canceled, whichever occurs first.
