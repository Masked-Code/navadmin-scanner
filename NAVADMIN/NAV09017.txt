SUBJ/PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) UPDATE AND ZONE B IMPLEMENTATION 
PROCEDURES//
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN DESCRIBES PROCEDURES FOR IMPLEMENTING ZONE B PTS, 
THE REQUIREMENT TO DOCUMENT THE SAILOR'S PTS INTENTIONS USING THE NAVY 
STANDARD INTEGRATED PERSONNEL SYSTEM (NSIPS), AND ENHANCEMENTS TO THE 
PTS PROCESS.  THE PERFORM TO SERVE PROGRAM IS A VITAL PART OF OUR 
NAVY'S TOTAL FORCE STRATEGY, PROVIDING AN OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP OUR BEST 
AND BRIGHTEST SAILORS IN ORDER TO MEET FUTURE FLEET AND RATING NEEDS.  
CURRENTLY, THERE ARE MORE SAILORS THAN REQUIRED IN CERTAIN RATINGS.  
THESE CONDITIONS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT CAREER PROGRESSION AND 
ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SAILORS IN OVERMANNED RATINGS AND HAVE A 
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON MISSION READINESS AND FLEET CAPABILITIES WHEN A 
RATING LACKS THE APPROPRIATE INVENTORY.  BEGINNING
1 FEBRUARY 2009, PERFORM TO SERVE WILL BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE SAILORS 
IN BOTH ZONE A AND ZONE B.  SAILORS GIVEN AN IN RATE REENLISTMENT OR 
CONVERT QUOTA WILL BE REQUIRED TO SIGN A PAGE 13, WHICH OUTLINES 
REENLISTMENT INTENTIONS TO ACCEPT AN IN 
RATE QUOTA OR ACCEPT A RATE CONVERSION.    
2.  QUOTA RESERVATION
    A.  BEGINNING 1 FEBRUARY 2009, RESERVATION QUOTAS GRANTED FOR AN 
IN-RATE REENLISTMENT OR CONVERSION TO ANOTHER RATING REQUIRE A SIGNED 
PAGE 13 IN NSIPS, WITHIN 30 DAYS OF MESSAGE RECEIPT, STATING A 
COMMITMENT OF INTENT TO REMAIN ON ACTIVE DUTY.  RESERVATIONS WILL BE 
REMOVED 60 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF MESSAGE IF A PAGE 13 IS NOT RECORDED.  
THOSE SAILORS WHO CURRENTLY HAVE A PTS APPROVED QUOTA IN ZONE A WILL BE 
REQUIRED TO SIGN A PAGE 13 NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS FROM THE RELEASE OF 
THIS MESSAGE IN ORDER TO RETAIN THEIR QUOTA.  QUOTAS WILL BE REMOVED 
FROM THE SYSTEM FOR THOSE SAILORS WHO DO NOT HAVE A PAGE 13 RECORDED BY 
1 APRIL 2009.  THE PROCEDURES FOR ENTERING AND VERIFYING A PAGE 13 CAN 
BE FOUND ON THE NPC WEBSITE 
(WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/CAREERINFO/STAYNAVYTOOLS/CIMS/).  PSD/CSD/PAPA DET, 
ALONG WITH COMMAND CAREER COUNSELORS, WILL ENSURE THE PAGE 13 IS 
DOCUMENTED IN NSIPS, INCLUDING FINAL VERIFICATION.  THE PAGE 13 IS PRE-
LOADED IN NSIPS UNDER THE TITLE PTS INTENTION.  COMMANDS SERVICED BY 
PAPA DET WILL COMPLETE PAGE 13 REQUIREMENTS VIA TRANSACTION ONLINE 
PROCESSING SYSTEM (TOPS).  FINAL VERIFICATION OF THE PAGE 13 LIES WITH 
THE PERSONNEL SUPERVISOR AT THE PSD/CSD/PAPA DET OR AFLOAT PERSONNEL 
DEPARTMENT.  IN SPECIAL CASES WHERE NSIPS IS NOT AVAILABLE, COMMANDS 
ARE DIRECTED TO SUBMIT A COPY OF THE PAGE 13 TO NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND 
CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER VIA FAX AT (901) 874-2116 OR EMAIL AT 
CSCMAILBOX(AT)NAVY.MIL.  THE PTS PAGE 13 TEMPLATE IS AVAILABLE ON THE 
NPC WEBSITE AT WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/CAREERINFO/PERFORMTOSERVE/.
 
    B.  ONE OF THE FOLLOWING NOTES MUST BE ADDED TO THE PAGE 13 AS
APPLICABLE:
        (1) I ACCEPT THE RESERVATION QUOTA FOR IN-RATE REENLISTMENT AND 
WILL ACQUIRE THE REQUIRED OBLISERVE PRIOR TO MY EAOS.
        (2) I ACCEPT THE RESERVATION QUOTA FOR CONVERSION TO APPROVED 
RATING AND WILL ACQUIRE THE REQUIRED OBLISERVE PRIOR 
TO MY EAOS.                       
3.  ZONE B PTS:
    A.  ZONE B PTS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BEGINNING 1 FEBRUARY 2009.
    B.  A ZONE B SAILOR IS A SAILOR WHO HAS MORE THAN SIX, BUT LESS 
THAN OR EQUAL TO TEN YEARS OF SERVICE.  
    C.  ALL E-4 TO E-6 SAILORS WITH AN EAOS OR PRD ON OR AFTER
1 OCTOBER 2009 AND WHO WILL BE IN ZONE B LIMITS ON THE DATE OF THEIR 
EAOS OR PRD, ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A PTS APPLICATION, 
REGARDLESS OF THEIR REENLISTMENT INTENTIONS.   
    D.  SAILORS MUST HAVE AN APPROVED ZONE B PTS RESERVATION PRIOR TO 
REENLISTING, EXTENDING THEIR EAOS, OR NEGOTIATING ORDERS IF THEIR EAOS 
OR PRD MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS IN PARAGRAPH C.
    E.  ZONE B PTS WILL FOLLOW THE SAME BASIC PROCESSING GUIDELINES AND 
PROCEDURES AS ZONE A PTS.  
    F.  SAILORS IN PAYGRADE E-6 THAT HAVE BEEN SELECTED OR FROCKED TO 
E-7 ARE EXEMPT FROM ZONE B PTS.
    G.  PERSONNEL ALREADY UNDER PCS ORDERS, PERSONNEL WITH AN APPROVED 
CONVERSION PACKAGE, OR PERSONNEL WITH AN APPROVED SRB PRECERT AT THE 
TIME OF THE RELEASE OF THIS NAVADMIN ARE NOT AFFECTED.
    H.  SUBMISSION AND PROCESSING
        (1) DEADLINE FOR INITIAL APPLICATIONS FOR ZONE B SAILORS IS
27 FEBRUARY 2009.  THEREAFTER, THE SUBMISSION DEADLINE WILL BE THE LAST 
FRIDAY OF EACH MONTH.  REQUESTS RECEIVED AFTER THE DEADLINE WILL BE 
PROCESSED THE FOLLOWING MONTH.
        (2) THE PRIMARY METHOD OF SUBMISSION WILL BE WEB BASED USING 
THE PTS HOMEPAGE LINK ON THE NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (NPC) WEBSITE, 
HTTP://WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/CAREERINFO/PERFORMTOSERVE/, THEN CLICKING ON 
PTS HOMEPAGE.  AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR COMMAND SUBMISSION IF WEB 
ACCESS IS NOT AVAILABLE WILL BE TO SUBMIT THE PTS SPREADSHEET 
(DOWNLOADABLE FROM THE NPC WEBSITE) USING ENCRYPTED PASSWORD PROTECTED 
EMAIL TO CSCMAILBOX(AT)NAVY.MIL.  INCLUDE IN THE SUBJ
LINE: PTS APPLICATIONS FOR UIC XXXXX.  ZONE B PTS CONVERSION 
APPLICATIONS WILL ONLY BE PROCESSED BY THE PTS WEB SERVICE OR PTS 
SPREADSHEET SUBMISSION METHODS.  FLEET RATING IDENTIFICATION ENGINE 
(FLEET RIDE) WILL NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF PROCESSING ZONE B PTS 
CONVERSION REQUEST APPLICATIONS UNTIL THIRD QUARTER FY-09.
        (3) COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO UPDATE AN INDIVIDUAL'S PTS 
REQUEST IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING CHANGES OCCUR: PAY GRADE, EVALUATION 
PERFORMANCE, THE SAILOR'S CONVERSION DESIRES, OR THE SAILOR'S 
CONVERSION CHOICES.  COMMANDS MAY CANCEL OR UPDATE PTS REQUESTS USING 
ONLINE WEB APPLICATIONS OR E-MAIL.
        (4) MONTHLY CONVERSION QUOTAS WILL BE PROVIDED ON THE NPC 
WEBSITE. 
4.  PTS ENHANCEMENTS AND UPDATES
    A.  ENHANCEMENTS
        (1) MAY-SEPTEMBER 2008 - PTS APPLICATIONS (ZONE A ONLY) WERE 
INTERFACED WITH FLEET RIDE, GIVING COMMAND CAREER COUNSELORS THE 
ABILITY TO SUBMIT BOTH USN ACTIVE COMPONENT (AC) AND FULL TIME SUPPORT 
(FTS) APPLICATIONS USING THE FLEET RIDE WEB SERVICE.  
THE ABILITY TO USE FLEET RIDE'S CLASSIFICATION ENGINE REDUCED THE 
AMOUNT OF CONVERSION ERRORS AND GAVE COMMAND CAREER COUNSELORS THE 
ABILITY TO TRACK EACH SAILOR'S APPLICATION STATUS.  
        (2) DECEMBER 2008 - THE STACKING ALGORITHM WAS MODIFIED TO 
PLACE MORE EMPHASIS ON RETAINING CRITICAL SKILL SETS AND PERFORMANCE.
    B.  EFFECTIVE 1 FEBRUARY 2009, IF A SAILOR ANSWERS "NO" ON THE PTS 
APPLICATION TO THE QUESTION "DOES MEMBER DESIRE TO REENLIST?", THAT 
SAILOR WILL AUTOMATICALLY RECEIVE A ROLLOVER STATUS AND CONTINUE TO 
RECEIVE THE ROLLOVER STATUS UNTIL THEY ARE SIX MONTHS FROM THEIR EAOS.  
AT THAT POINT, THE SAILOR WILL RECEIVE A MESSAGE TO START THE 
TRANSITION PROCESS.  IF A SAILOR'S INTENTION CHANGES WHILE IN THE PTS 
WINDOW, THE APPLICATION CAN BE MODIFIED TO REFLECT 
THE DESIRE TO REENLIST AND WILL BE PROCESSED NORMALLY.      
    C.  EXTENSIONS AND GENDET REAPPLY
        (1) CO'S AUTHORITY TO GRANT A TWO-MONTH EXTENSION WHILE 
AWAITING PTS RESULTS OR FOR THE TRANSITION PROCESS IS NO LONGER 
AUTHORIZED.
        (2) EXTENSIONS THAT WOULD TAKE A SAILOR PAST ZONE A CAN ONLY BE 
GRANTED WITH ZONE A PTS APPROVAL AND MUST BE IAW MILPERMAN 1160-040.
        (3) GENDET REAPPLY OPTION HAS BEEN ELIMINATED.
    D.  FUTURE CHANGES
        (1) THIRD QUARTER FY-09 - PTS WILL BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE A 
SELECTED RESERVE OPTION.  THIS FUNCTION WILL ALLOW AN ACTIVE COMPONENT 
(AC) SAILOR TO SIMULTANEOUSLY APPLY FOR BOTH AC AND RC OPPORTUNITIES.  
AN AC SAILOR WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE OPTION OF CHOOSING THE ACTIVE OR 
RESERVE COMPONENT EVEN AFTER AN IN-RATE DETERMINATION IS MADE.
5.  NAVY PERSONNEL CAN CALL 1-866-U-ASK-NPC OR (866) 827-5672, OR EMAIL 
THE NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND'S CALL CENTER IN MILLINGTON AT 
CSCMAILBOX(AT)NAVY.MIL WITH QUESTIONS CONCERNING THIS POLICY UPDATE AND 
NEW PTS IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES.  THIS CALL CENTER WILL BE MANNED 
MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY, 7 A.M. TO 7 P.M., CENTRAL 
STANDARD TIME.
