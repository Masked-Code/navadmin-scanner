SUBJ/ANNUAL RECERTIFICATION OF SPECIAL DUTY ASSIGNMENT PAY//

REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/5OCT17//
REF/B/DOC/DODI/11JAN19//

NARR/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1160.6C, SPECIAL DUTY ASSIGNMENT PAY PROGRAM.   
REF B IS DOD INSTRUCTION 1340.26 CHANGE 1, ASSIGNMENT AND SPECIAL DUTY 
ASSIGNMENT PAY.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the annual Special Duty Assignment Pay 
(SDAP) recertification process for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024.  In line with 
references (a) and (b), Commanding Officers (CO) are required to annually 
review and certify the entitlement to SDAP for each Sailor in their command.  
This recertification is vital for verifying that every Sailor assigned to an 
eligible billet remains qualified to fill the billet and is receiving the 
correct SDAP level.

2.  Recertification will commence upon the release of this NAVADMIN and will 
continue through 30 September 2024.  The Community Management Support Branch 
(BUPERS-328) will stop SDAP for all SDAP recipients at each command who fail 
to complete the recertification process.

3.  A complete list of authorized skills and pay amounts can be obtained from 
the MyNavy HR website at: https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
Management/Community-Management/Enlisted-Career-Admin/SRB-SDAP-Enl-Bonus/, 
then scroll to "SDAP Levels with Admin Updates."

4.  Recertification process:
    a.  Obtain a summary of the authorized SDAP billets for the command using 
the MyNavy Assignments database.  This is the filtered Billet Based 
Distribution (BBD) report for the command that only lists the Sailors who are 
currently receiving SDAP.
        (1) This report may not be exhaustive.  Certifying commands must 
verify their entire complement of Sailors in order to validate SDAP payments 
to those who may not be electronically gained to the command or Sailors who 
are gained, but are erroneously being paid SDAP.
        (2) Commands without an Activity Manning Manager may request access 
to Command Career Management System-Interactive Detailing using the procedure 
outlined in the following MyNavy HR web address:
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Portals/55/Career/Detailing/MyNavyAssignment/My
Navy_Assignment_Access.pdf.  Certifying commands must have access to all 
subordinate Unit Identification Codes (UIC).
        (3) Commands may contact BUPERS-328 via mill_sdap_recert.fct@navy.mil 
or (901)874-3260/DSN 882 for additional assistance in obtaining their SDAP 
BBD report.
    b.  Validate the entire command using the SDAP BBD report from the MyNavy 
Assignments database as follows:
        (1) Next to each Sailor listed on the report, simply annotate the 
SDAP level and the associated Navy Enlisted Classification for which SDAP is 
authorized in line with the most current SDAP eligibility chart.  Any 
erroneous SDAP payments must be corrected through the Transaction Service 
Centers (TSC) upon discovery.
        (2) In the event of an unposted activity loss or strength loss that 
resulted in a Sailor who has already transferred being still listed in the 
BBD report, simply line out or delete the line item.
        (3) Sailors who are not listed in the report due to a delayed or 
unposted activity gain should be added to the list and validated 
appropriately.
        (4) Once each Sailor at the command is validated, a signed letter 
from the CO or acting (not by direction) will be addressed and forwarded to 
Director, Military Community Management (BUPERS-3) with the SDAP BBD report 
as an enclosure.  The contents of the validation letter will include a 
statement from the CO certifying that a complete review of all authorized 
SDAP billets at the command was conducted and all discrepancies are rectified 
or are in the process of being resolved.  The letter will also contain the e-
mail address and phone number of a suitable point of contact at the command 
and should also contain a list of all pending discrepancy resolutions.
        (5) Send the command SDAP recertification letter and enclose the SDAP 
report via encrypted e-mail to BUPERS-3 at: mill_sdap_recert.fct@navy.mil.  
The e-mail subject line must contain the UIC of the certifying command.
        (6) If a command has trouble sending the encrypted e-mail, ensure the 
encryption e-mail certificate is posted to the global address list.  If there 
are still encryption issues, contact BUPERS-
328 for additional options.
        (7) E-mail is the preferred method, but if the command needs to send 
the report via regular mail, please send to: 

            Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS 3)
            Military Community Management
            ATTN:  (BUPERS 328) BLDG 453 RM 338
            5720 Integrity Drive
            Millington TN 38055-0003

5.  Should a service record or payment update become necessary, each command 
is responsible for completing this action via their servicing TSC.  All 
corrective transactions older than 240 days will be processed by BUPERS-328 
via an emailed request submitted to mill_incen_pays.fct@navy.mil.

6.  Commands can check the status of their SDAP recertification at:
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Enlisted-Career-Admin/SRB-SDAP-Enl-Bonus/, then scroll to the SDAP 
section and click on "SDAP Delinquent List."  Immediate Superior in Commands 
are strongly encouraged to use this site to ensure all subordinate commands 
have completed the recertification process.  Please allow 5 to 10 days after 
submission for the webpage to be updated.

7.  BUPERS-328 is the sole authority to resume SDAP payments for commands 
whose SDAP payments were stopped as a result of failing to complete the 
annual recertification on time.  SDAP can be restored for delinquent commands 
upon completion of the aforementioned recertification process.

8.  The point of contact is BUPERS-328, mill_sdap_recert.fct@navy.mil,  
(901) 874-3260/DSN 882.

9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until October 2024 unless superseded 
prior to that date.
