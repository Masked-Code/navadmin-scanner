SUBJ/100TH ANNIVERSARY OF NAVAL AVIATION// 
RMKS/1.  2011 IS THE YEAR IN WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY WILL 
RECOGNIZE THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF NAVAL AVIATION.
2.  ON 8 MAY 1911, CAPTAIN WASHINGTON IRVING CHAMBERS, UNITED STATES 
NAVY, OFFICER IN CHARGE OF AVIATION, PREPARED THE REQUISITION FOR THE 
NAVY'S FIRST AIRCRAFT TO BE PURCHASED FROM AVIATOR AND INVENTOR GLENN H. 
CURTISS.  AFTER 97 YEARS, NAVAL AVIATION HAS GROWN FROM A TACTICAL 
AFTERTHOUGHT AND SUPPORT CAPABILITY TO A PRIMARY INSTRUMENT OF OUR 
NATIONAL SECURITY.  FROM THE CURTISS A-1 TRIAD, TO THE F/A-18 SUPER 
HORNET, FROM THE USS LANGLEY (CV 1) TO THE USS RONALD REAGAN (CVN 76), 
NAVAL AVIATION HAS SCORED AN IMPRESSIVE LIST OF ACHIEVEMENTS IN PEACE 
AND WAR.  THE FIRST CROSSING OF THE ATLANTIC BY AIR, VICTORY AT THE 
BATTLE OF MIDWAY, AND THE FIRST AMERICAN IN SPACE, TO NAME A FEW, PUT 
NAVAL AVIATION AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR NATIONAL DESTINY.
3.  IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT DURING THE CENTENNIAL YEAR OF NAVAL AVIATION, 
DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, COAST GUARD PERSONNEL, THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, AND 
FRIENDS AND ALLIES OVERSEAS BE AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE 
THE HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENTS OF NAVAL AVIATION AND BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH 
ITS RICH AND COLORFUL HERITAGE.
4.  COMMANDER, NAVAL AIR FORCES WILL BE THE EXECUTIVE AGENT FOR 
PLANNING AND EXECUTING ALL EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF NAVAL AVIATION.  COMMANDER, NAVAL AIR FORCES WILL FORMALLY ESTABLISH 
A CENTENNIAL OF NAVAL AVIATION TASK FORCE WITH REPRESENTATION FROM 
THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH NAVAL AVIATION TO SYNCHRONIZE 
ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT CALENDAR YEAR 2011.  
COMMANDER, NAVAL AIR FORCES WILL:
A.  DESIGNATE AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTENNIAL OF NAVAL AVIATION 
TASK FORCE.
B.  ESTABLISH MEMBERSHIP FOR THE CENTENNIAL OF NAVAL AVIATION TASK 
FORCE.
C.  PROVIDE PLANNING AND EXECUTION UPDATES TO NAVY LEADERSHIP.
D.  FORWARD FOR APPROVAL, EVENTS THAT REQUIRE INTERAGENCY ENGAGEMENT 
AND COORDINATION.
5.  THE CENTENNIAL OF NAVAL AVIATION AFFORDS THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
REAFFIRM TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT THEIR COUNTRY'S SECURITY IS 
ASSURED BY A STRONG NAVY, MARINE CORPS, AND COAST GUARD.  IT WILL HONOR 
OUR LEGACY AND RECOGNIZE THE ONGOING CONTRIBUTIONS OF NAVAL AVIATION TO 
OUR COUNTRY'S SAFETY, SECURITY, AND PROSPERITY.
