6.  Virtual Training.  Current assessments indicate that all training sites 
will shift to virtual delivery.  However, the final decision for virtual 
training versus face-to-face training will be made at the latest 2 weeks 
prior to the training event.  Virtual training will be activated for all 
training sites that are assessed as RED from the My Navy Portal two tier 
travel tracker (COVID 19 Unrestricted Travel Tracker 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/don-covid-19-travel-tracker), or if they 
require a 14-day ROM period, or have a 70-person group gathering cap.  If 
virtual delivery is activated, the PDTW/PDTC will be delivered through the 
Naval Chaplaincy School and Center Adobe Connect virtual delivery platform. 
Participants are still required to register for the PDTW and PDTC via eNTRS. 
For sites where virtual training is activated, a memo detailing login 
instructions, participant expectations, and other helpful information will be 
emailed to all registered participants no later than two weeks prior to the 
course convene.

7.  Travel.  Subject to local approval, commands are authorized to provide 
funding in support of religious ministries within the command to include 
funding chaplains and RPs to attend annual PDTW/PDTC according to references
(e) through (g).  Participants are encouraged to attend training in their 
local areas.

8.  Registration.  Chaplains and RPs are highly encouraged to attend all four 
days of training and must register for both the PDTW (CIN:  A-5G-0005)

Naval Training Reservation System (eNTRS) via self-registration or the

prospective students are required to provide current email contact
