RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides additional guidance to references (a) and
(b), Navy Information Technology Procurement Requirements (ITPR) policies.
ITPRs will be submitted electronically via the Navy Information Technology
Approval System (NAV-ITAS) per reference (c), found at
https://navitas.navy.mil /index.aspx.
    a.  Reference (d) sets Echelon II Chief Information Officer (CIO)
approval authority.  Echelon II CIOs have discretion to set local approval
threshold amounts for assigned Echelon III and below commands.  Investments
that are $20 million or greater will be routed through an additional
Department of Navy Deputy Chief Information Officer (Navy) (DDCIO(N))
approval step.
    b.  ITPRs for the procurement of multi-functional device and print
device products and/or services from Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) must be
submitted by 22 June 2023 in order to meet the DLA procurement cut-off date
of 1 July 2023.  Requests submitted after 22 June 2023 will not be
considered without documented extenuating circumstances.
    c.  Cloud services shall be provisioned per reference (e).
    d.  ITPRs containing data center/data server items must route through
the Data Center/Data Server Approval process to be reviewed and approved by
DDCIO(N), and in some cases Department of Navy CIO.
    e.  Requests for Navy Public Affairs requirements consumable items and
peripheral devices (imaging devices) should be nominally reviewed and 
approved at each Echelon II/III command and DDCIO(N) per its threshold 
approval authority.

2.  ITPR submitters should contact their Echelon II Customer Service
Representatives (CSR) with any questions about the ITPR policy or any
guidelines issued herein.  Information on Echelon II CSRs can be found on
the NAV-ITAS site at https://navitas.navy.mil/ContactUs.aspx.
