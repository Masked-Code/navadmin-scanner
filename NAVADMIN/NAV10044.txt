SUBJ/NAVY SAFE HARBOR//

RMKS/ 1. OUR SAILORS MAKE ENORMOUS SACRIFICES TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY AND TO 
SUPPORT THE NAVY'S MISSION.  IT IS A COVENANT OF LEADERSHIP THAT WE SHOULD IN 
TURN GIVE 100 PERCENT OF OUR SUPPORT WHEN THEY BECOME WOUNDED, ILL, OR 
INJURED.  I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE OF OUR BEST INITIATIVES, NAVY SAFE HARBOR.

2.  NAVY SAFE HARBOR IS THE LEAD ORGANIZATION FOR PROVIDING NON-MEDICAL CARE 
TO SERIOUSLY WOUNDED, ILL, AND INJURED SAILORS, COAST GUARDSMEN, AND THEIR 
FAMILIES.  THROUGH PROACTIVE LEADERSHIP, SAFE HARBOR PROVIDES A LIFETIME OF 
INDIVIDUALLY-TAILORED ASSISTANCE DESIGNED TO OPTIMIZE THE SUCCESS OF OUR 
SHIPMATES' RECOVERY, REHABILITATION, AND REINTEGRATION ACTIVITIES. IT IS 
INCUMBENT UPON NAVY LEADERS TO ENSURE THAT WOUNDED WARRIORS ARE REFERRED TO 
SAFE HARBOR FOR HELP AND TO SUPPORT THEM WITH THEIR RECOVERY AND RETURN TO A 
HEALTHY, PRODUCTIVE LIFE.

3.  NAVY MEDICINE HAS LONG PROVIDED WORLD-CLASS MEDICAL CARE TO WOUNDED, ILL, 
AND INJURED SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES.  TO EXTEND THAT STANDARD OF 
CARE BEYOND MEDICAL TREATMENT, NAVY SAFE HARBOR SUPPORTS SAILORS, GUARDIANS 
AND THEIR FAMILIES BY PROVIDING NON-MEDICAL CARE MANAGEMENT.  SAFE HARBOR 
COLLABORATES WITH ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF THE NAVY TO ADDRESS PAY 
AND PERSONNEL ISSUES, INVITATIONAL TRAVEL ORDERS FOR CAREGIVERS, HOUSING AND 
LODGING ARRANGEMENTS, CHILD AND YOUTH PROGRAMS, RECREATION AND LEISURE 
PROGRAMS, TRANSPORTATION NEEDS, LEGAL AND GUARDIANSHIP ISSUES, EDUCATION AND 
TRAINING BENEFITS, COMMISSARY AND EXCHANGE ACCESS, RESPITE CARE, TRAUMATIC 
BRAIN INJURY AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER SUPPORT SERVICES, AND MUCH 
MORE.

ISSUES, BEING ESPECIALLY VIGILANT OF DEPLOYMENT RELATED PROBLEMS.  WORK WITH 
YOUR SAILORS TO GET THEM THE NECESSARY CARE AND SUPPORT THEY HAVE EARNED.  IT 
IS A RESPONSIBILITY OF COVENANT LEADERSHIP, AND SAFE HARBOR IS THERE TO HELP.
