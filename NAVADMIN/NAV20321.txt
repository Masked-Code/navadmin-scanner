RMKS/1. Reference (a) directed the Secretary of Defense, no later than 1 
December 2020, to provide legal counsel to victims of alleged domestic 
violence offenses.  Per references (b) and (c), the Navy is enhancing its 
legal services accordingly. 
 
2.  The Navy is committed to delivering comprehensive legal support to 
spouses, intimate partners, and immediate family members who experience 
domestic violence committed by or against a member of the Armed 
Forces.  These victims may greatly benefit from legal expertise, in addition 
to other family support programs. Two types of Judge Advocate General's Corps 
attorneys are available to help victims:  Legal Assistance Attorneys and 
Victims? Legal Counsel. 
 
3.  Legal Assistance (LA):  Victims of domestic violence may need advice on 
personal safety and family law issues. LA Attorneys can support in the 
following ways: 
    a.  Assistance with getting Military Protective Orders or civilian 
    protective orders; 
    b.  Assistance with lease terminations; 
    c.  Assistance with seeking interim financial support; and 
    d.  Assistance with divorce and custody issues, including identification 
of local legal resources, as needed. 
 
4. Victims? Legal Counsel (VLC):  In addition to LA services, the Navy will 
provide VLC services to victims of domestic violence.  Effective 1 December 
2020, victims of domestic violence may consult a legal expert for information 
about the military criminal justice process and their rights within that 
system. VLC can represent victims of domestic violence in the following 
situations: 
    a.  Throughout NCIS investigations, including attending interviews; 
    b.  Throughout courts-martial; and 
    c.  During any resulting or other related administrative processes. 
 
5.  Eligibility for LA services is based upon reference (d) and includes but 
is not limited to active-duty service members and their dependents; retirees 
and their dependents; Reservists on active-duty orders; and certain 
Department of Defense (DoD) civilian employees. Eligibility for VLC services 
is based on references (d) and (e) and includes but is not limited to active-
duty service members and their dependents; retirees; Reservists; and DoD 
civilian employees.
