SUBJ/NAVY TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM POLICY UPDATE FOR COVID-19//

REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/24AUG16//
REF/B/MSG/301316ZSEP19//

NARR/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1900.2C. 
REF B IS NAVADMIN 223/19.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the immediate suspension of all Navy 
Transition Assistance Program (TAP) in-person classes listed in references 
(a) and (b) until further notice in order to minimize the risk of exposure to 
COVID-19.  Commanders must continue to ensure transitioning Service Members 
are prepared to reintegrate into the civilian community, especially in the 
challenging times we face.
    a.  Service Members with upcoming separation dates, who are unable to 
reschedule TAP attendance for a later date, must complete TAP via Joint 
Knowledge Online (JKO) (https://jkodirect.jten.mil).
Details on the TAP virtual curriculum are available at 
https://webdm.dmdc.osd.mil/dodtap/virtual_curriculum.html
    b.  Initial Self-Assessment Counseling, Pre-Separation Counseling and 
Capstone sessions are still required and may be conducted in-person using 
proper social-distancing protocol or telephonically by command career 
counselors or TAP managers.
    c.  Service Members with sufficient time remaining prior to their 
separation or retirement date should reschedule the TAP course for a later 
date.  The Navy understands this may not meet the 365- days prior to 
separation start time or 90-days prior to separation Capstone requirement.  
However, Service Members must make every effort to complete all TAP 
requirements prior to separation.
    d.  Please continue to document JKO course completions and all eForm data 
in line with standard procedures listed in reference (b).
    e.  Reserve Component Service Members on Active-Duty orders greater than 
179 days must adhere to paragraphs (a) and (b).
Mobilized Reservists who are within 60 days of redeployment and/or 
demobilization must complete TAP classes via JKO.  JKO completion 
certificates should be presented to Expeditionary Combat Readiness Center 
(ECRC) upon arrival.  ECRC will document JKO course completions via eForm and 
complete all TAP requirements.
    f.  For additional information or questions, the Navy TAP point of 
contact is Mr. Tom Albert, Family Readiness Branch, at (901) 874- 4254/
DSN 882 or via e-mail at tom.albert(at)navy.mil.

2.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
