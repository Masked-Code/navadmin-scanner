DECISIONS PEER MENTORING PROGRAM//
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the 2014 monthly topics for the Peer 
Mentorship Program, Coalition of Sailors Against Destructive Decisions 
(CSADD).  The CSADD program began as a grassroots initiative to tackle the 
increasing number of driving under the influence incidences among junior 
Sailors in 2008 and has grown to be a valuable Navy-wide program with over 
300 chapters and sub-chapters fleet-wide.  Throughout our organizations, 
junior Sailors are stepping up to help leadership communicate Navy's mission 
and promote good decision making on and off-duty.  In 2011, CSADD adopted the 
theme "Navigating Success" and created a logo (ship's wheel with "Maintaining 
Our Course" at the bottom of the wheel).  Numerous CSADD videos, posters, and 
informational products are available via command CSADD chapter Facebook pages 
and YouTube. These creative and innovative products reinforce Navy's twenty-
first century Sailor vision, championing messages concerning bystander 
intervention, stress management, nutrition, physical fitness, mental fitness, 
responsible use of alcohol, on and off-duty safety, and 
inclusion.  Additionally, these products do an outstanding job of 
communicating information about Navy prevention programs including suicide, 
sexual assault, child abuse, alcohol/drug abuse and domestic violence.
 
2.  The CSADD program is not the single remedy for all destructive behaviors 
in the Navy but if Sailors closest to the issues (junior sailors age 18-25) 
want to participate in finding solutions, top down leadership support is 
critical for this bottom up movement. The key focus areas each month are as 
follows:

3.  These key focal training topics are designed to provoke thought and 
inspire young leaders to discuss these issues, and create awareness through a 
variety of social networks and activities at the most junior 
level.  Leadership efforts to inspire and support these groups and activities 
will enable continued success as our young sailors take on leadership 
challenges on and off-duty.
 
4.  Additional information will be posted on the CSADD website at
Http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/support/21st_century_sailor/csadd/pages/default2.aspx.  In addition, 
chapters are encouraged to use their CSADD Facebook page to post best 
practices and share planned activities and initiatives.
 
5.  Resiliency of our sailors and their families is the ultimate 
goal.  Achieving success and eliminating destructive decisions from our Navy 
will take collaboration between CSADD and other Navy readiness and resiliency 
programs.
