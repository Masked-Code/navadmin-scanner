RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN extends reference (a) and announces the policy and 
guidance for Calendar Year (CY) 2023 season two Meritorious Advancement 
Program (MAP) for Active Duty (Active Component and Training and 
Administration of the Reserve (TAR)) Sailors.  MAP season two runs from 15 
September through 15 October 2023.  This season continues the added preseason 
window for commands to verify user hierarchies and unit identification code 
(UIC) assignments ahead of the season.  The timeline in paragraph 3 contains 
details. 
 
2.  MAP targets approximately 20 percent of total advancements during CY23, 
with roughly half of the available MAP quotas allocated for each of two MAP 
seasons during the year.  The two-season framework aligns MAP with the Navy-
wide advancement exam (NWAE). This is to ensure any unused MAP quotas are 
included in the NWAE cycle and to emphasize the intent of MAP to select and 
reward top-performing Sailors.  To meet required time-in-rate (TIR) for MAP 
advancement eligibility, Sailors must have a date of rank no later than the 
following: 
    a.  E-5:  1 July 2022. 
    b.  E-5 (Nuclear-Trained Sailors):  1 July 2021. 
    c.  E-4 and below:  No TIR requirement. 
 
3.  Timeline: 
    a.  MAP Pre-season:  1-12 September 2023. 
    b.  MAP Quotas Uploaded:  13 September 2023. 
    c.  CY-23 MAP Season 2:  15 September - 15 October 2023. 
 
4.  In line with references (b) through (d), MAP advancement to 
ABH2, ABF2, GSM2 CS2, MM2, IC2, DC2, RS2, ABE2, AME2, EM2, QM2, AO2, and GM2 
is not authorized due to those Sailors having advancement opportunities 
within Detailing Marketplace Assignment Policy (DMAP). 
Additional details are located on the MyNavy HRs DMAP website, 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Detailing/Enlisted/Detailing-
Marketplace/. 
 
5.  Commands are required to have two Navy Standard Integrated Personnel 
System (NSIPS) MAP user roles (command reviewer and command reporting senior) 
in order to submit MAP advancements, exceptions to policy (ETPs) and 
additional MAP quota requests through NSIPS.  NSIPS Web Afloat users and 
commands without access to NSIPS should refer to paragraph 5a for 
instructions on submitting their MAP advancements.  The system uses 
authoritative data to determine eligibility.  However, commands are required 
to locally validate that MAP candidates have successfully completed the 
professional military knowledge eligibility examination (PMKEE) requirement 
for E-5 and E-6 MAP advancements only (PMKEE requirement for E-4 has been 
removed in line with reference (e)) prior to the first day of the MAP season 
(15 September 2023) as outlined in reference (f).  For training on user 
roles, log into NSIPS via https://www.nsips.cloud.navy.mil/, click on 
training tab, then click MAP tutorial (JPA). 
    a.  NSIPS Web Afloat users and commands without access to NSIPS must 
submit a MAP nomination request via e-mail directly to their immediate 
superior in charge (ISIC), type commander (TYCOM) or budget submitting office 
(BSO)/echelon II command using the meritorious certification letter 
(MCL).  The letter must be signed by the commanding officer and should 
address any ETP and/or additional quotas requested.  Sample MCLs and detailed 
information regarding the offline process can be found via MyNavy HR at 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Enlisted-Career-Admin/Advancement/MAP/ 
    b.  Quota usage, modifications, and distribution will be managed 
within the NSIPS environment.  BSO and command quotas will be 
uploaded into NSIPS on 13 September 2023 and can be found under the 
quota summary report tab.  Quotas can also be found via the MyNavy 
HR website:  
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Enlisted-Career-Admin/Advancement/MAP/ 
    c.  Additional quotas can be requested using the quota request option by 
the command reviewer user role in NSIPS.  Commands must contact their BSO to 
determine timeline for additional quota requests.  Whether or not command 
quotas are authorized, all commands have the opportunity to request quotas 
from their BSO/echelon II command, via their ISIC and TYCOM. 
    d.  NSIPS will automatically determine if an ETP is required using 
predetermined criteria.  Service Members in ratings requiring security 
clearances and rates/pay grades requiring TIR waivers will be automatically 
routed for adjudication.  The request will be routed through the ISIC, TYCOM, 
and BSO/echelon II command using a hierarchical workflow. 
    e.  NSIPS will not automatically generate an ETP for Nuclear-trained 
Service Members.  Commands desiring to advance a nuclear-trained Service 
Member not meeting the TIR requirement must request an ETP to Director, 
Military Personnel Plans and Policy (OPNAV N13) via the Nuclear Program 
Manager (OPNAV N133).
