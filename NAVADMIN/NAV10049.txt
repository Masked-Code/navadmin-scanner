SUBJ/SPECIALTY CAREER PATH PROGRAM EXPANSION//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE EXPANSION OF THE SPECIALTY CAREER 
PATH (SCP) PROGRAM.  THE SURFACE WARFARE COMMUNITY DEVELOPED AND HAS 
BEEN UTILIZING OFFICERS IN SPECIALTY CAREER PATHS (SCP'S) SINCE JANUARY 
OF 2005.  SCP HAS BEEN A TRULY SUCCESSFUL INITIATIVE THAT HAS PROVIDED 
US WITH A CADRE OF OFFICERS WITH CRITICAL SKILLS IN KEY NAVY MISSION 
AREAS, AND IT IS NOW TIME TO EXPAND SCP TO THE AVIATION AND SUBMARINE 
COMMUNITIES.

2.  THE SCP PROGRAM PROVIDES ALTERNATIVES TO THE TRADITIONAL COMMAND AT 
SEA CAREER PATH AND SUPPORTS THE DEMAND FOR URL LCDR/CDR/CAPT EXPERTISE 
IN GROWING AND EXPANDING MISSION AREAS.  THE FOLLOWING SCP OPTIONS WILL 
BE OPENING TO QUALIFIED CANDIDATES:
- OPERATIONS ANALYSIS
- FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
- NAVAL OPERATIONAL PLANNER
- ANTITERRORISM/FORCE PROTECTION (NOTE 1)
- SHORE INSTALLATION MANAGEMENT (NOTE 1)
- ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE (NOTE 1)
- MINE WARFARE (NOTE 1)
- MISSILE DEFENSE (NOTE 1)
- STRATEGIC SEALIFT (NOTE 1)
- EDUCATION AND TRAINING MANAGEMENT
NOTE 1:  LEGACY SWO SCP

3.  BENEFITS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF SELECTION INCLUDE:
- MILESTONE BILLETS WITHIN SPECIALTY AREA
- SPECIALTY TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE
- POST-GRADUATE EDUCATION IN A SPECIALTY AREA

4.  OFFICERS DESIRING TO ENTER ONE OF THE SCP'S MAY DO SO UPON 
APPLICATION AND SELECTION.  ENTRY REQUIREMENTS WILL VARY BASED ON 
DESIGNATOR.  AN ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD CHAIRED BY A FLAG OFFICER WILL 
CONVENE ANNUALLY TO SELECT OFFICERS BEST QUALIFIED TO SERVE THE NEEDS 
OF THE NAVY IN EACH OF THE SCP'S.  ONCE SELECTED, OFFICERS WILL RECEIVE 
APPROPRIATE TRAINING AND EDUCATION, AND BE ASSIGNED TO BILLETS THAT 
DEVELOP EXPERIENCE IN THEIR SPECIALTY DURING NORMAL SEA/SHORE ROTATIONS.  
SELECTED OFFICERS WILL RETAIN THEIR ORIGINAL DESIGNATOR AND WILL 
RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATION DESIGNATOR
(AQD) THAT INDICATES THEIR AREA OF SPECIALIZATION.  CAREER PATHS ARE 
AVAILABLE FOR EACH OF THE TEN SCP'S WITH JOBS INCREASING IN COMPLEXITY 
AND RESPONSIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE CAREER.  FOR EXAMPLE, AN OFFICER 
TRANSITIONING TO THE SHORE INSTALLATION MANAGEMENT CAREER PATH MAY 
EXPECT A CAREER THAT INCLUDES TOURS AS A DEPARTMENT HEAD AND XO OF A 
NAVAL BASE, ASSIGNMENT TO REGIONAL COMMAND STAFFS, ASSIGNMENT TO THE 
CNI STAFF, AND O-5/O-6 TOURS AT NAVAL BASES AND INSTALLATIONS.  DURING 
THAT PROGRESSION, THE OFFICER WILL GAIN EXPERIENCE AND DEVELOP 
MANAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP SKILLS THAT WILL BEST SERVE THE NAVY WHILE 
PROVIDING ENHANCED OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESSFUL CAREER TRANSITION UPON 
RETIREMENT.  STAKEHOLDER POINTS OF CONTACT FOR EACH SCP AREA, SAMPLE 
CAREER PATHS AND SCP BILLETS CAN BE VIEWED AT THE FOLLOWING NPC WEB 
SITE, HTTP://WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/OFFICER/SPECIALTYCAREERPATH.htm.  CONTACT
