RMKS/1. This NAVADMIN announces the Low-Residency Graduate Education Program
(LGEP) Academic Year (AY) 2022-2023 and provides guidance for applications.

2. Background:
   a. LGEP provides naval officers in paygrades O-2 to O-5 with a Department 
of the Navy-funded graduate degree opportunity in strategy, management and 
international relations through a low-residency delivery model at selected 
regionally accredited partner universities or colleges.
   b. The LGEP pilot program will offer studies that are designed to fit into 
shore duty tours, allowing officers with compressed career paths to stay 
close to the waterfront or flight line while earning a Master's degree. LGEP 
study programs range from 16-24 months at partner universities that may 
include Old Dominion University (Master of Arts in International Studies with 
a Concentration in Strategic Leadership), William and Mary (Executive Masters 
of Business Administration), American University (Master of Science in 
Management with a Concentration in Strategy and Security), Johns Hopkins 
University (Master of Arts in Global Policy), University of California San 
Diego (Master of Advanced Studies in International Affairs) and the 
University of Washington (Executive Masters in Public Administration).
   c. Participants will remain at their duty stations and spend limited time 
on campus, completing the majority of the course material online or via 
phone.

3. Application and Selection Process:
   a. The application window will close on 30 June 2022.  Up to 60 
participants will be selected for Academic Year 2022-2023.  Target applicants 
are due-course warrior scholars who display all the qualities of dedicated 
career officers who aspire to command.
   b. Qualified candidates will meet the following prerequisite education and 
work experience criteria: O-2 to O-5, a Bachelor's degree from an accredited 
college or university, and a history of strong academic performance 
demonstrated by college transcripts.
   c. Candidates should submit their application package to 
shania.m.truelove.civ(at)us.navy.mil via encrypted email or the SAFE tool at 
https://safe.apps.mil no later than 30 June 2022.  Packages must include the
following: Commanding Officer's endorsement; Detailer/Moderator endorsement; 
applicant biography; academic transcripts (unofficial are acceptable for the 
initial application) from all undergraduate and higher education to include 
transfer credits; statement of purpose explaining why the applicant is 
interested in LGEP and how the education would benefit the DON. GRE/GMAT 
scores are not required.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy 
(Manpower and Reserve Affairs)(OASN(M&RA)) will forward the applications to 
the Services for approval prior to the Service Members' acceptance to LGEP.
   d. Applicants will first apply to LGEP and, if selected, go through an 
expedited application process with the selected partner school.  Applicants 
will be matched with school programs based on factors to include geographic 
location, career progression, prioritized student program preference, and the 
probability that the applicant will be accepted into the school's graduate 
program based upon previous academic performance.  Once provisionally 
accepted into the LGEP, students must provide official transcripts to the 
prospective university's graduate program, along with other information as 
required.
   e. LGEP selectees will be announced by 15 July 2022 via email from the 
Naval Education Division (NED), OASN (M&RA). The LGEP program will be 
centrally funded and cover tuition, required books up to $500.00 per 
semester, and local travel within a 75 mile radius.  Selectees will be 
responsible for internet access to participate in online assignments and web-
enabled interactions with instructors and other students.

4. Service Obligation:
   a. Per references (a) and (b), selected candidates must sign and commit to 
a Continued Service Agreement, which will incur a service obligation within 
the DON of three times the number of months spent in the academic program 
served concurrently with other obligations, up to a maximum of a three-year 
service obligation.  The service obligation will commence upon completion of 
or withdrawal from the program, and will be incurred whether or not the 
service member successfully completes the academic coursework or degree.

5. Point of contact:
   a. Shania M. Truelove at email: shania.m.truelove.civ(at)us.navy.mil.
   b. Submit applications to shania.m.truelove.civ(at)us.navy.mil via 
encrypted email or the SAFE tool at https://safe.apps.mil, with notification 
to Shania M. Truelove shania.m.truelove.civ(at)us.navy.mil) of package 
submission.

6.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
