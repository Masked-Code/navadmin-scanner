SUBJ/NAVY BIRTHDAY 2011//

RMKS/1.  ON 13 OCTOBER, THE NAVY CELEBRATES 236 YEARS OF ENDURING  TRADITIONS 
AND MISSIONS THAT HAVE PRESERVED FREEDOM OF THE SEAS AND THE AMERICAN WAY OF 
LIFE.  AS WE CELEBRATE THIS BIRTHDAY, WE CAN  REFLECT ON MORE THAN TWO 
CENTURIES OF WARFIGHTING EXCELLENCE WHILE  SERVING AS A GLOBAL FORCE FOR GOOD.  
THE METTLE AND TENACITY OF THAT  FLEDGLING FIGHTING FORCE ENDURES TODAY IN THE 
MEN AND WOMEN SERVING OUR NAVY AND NATION.

2.  OUR 200 YEAR HERITAGE IS STILL APPARENT TODAY.  AS IT WAS IN 1775, OUR 
PRIMARY JOINT PARTNER IS THE U.S. MARINE CORPS, AND OUR FOCUS IS "WARFIGHTING 
FIRST".  IT IS WHAT OUR NAVY DOES BEST, AND IT  WILL CONTINUE TO BE OUR 
PRIORITY.  SIMILARLY, WE HAVE TO "OPERATE  FORWARD" PROVIDING OUR NATION WITH 
CRITICAL OFFSHORE OPTIONS AND  BRINGING VITAL SECURITY AND STABILITY TO 
MARITIME CROSSROADS AROUND THE WORLD.  FINALLY, AS HISTORY HAS SO OFTEN TAUGHT 
US, WE MUST "BE  READY" TO ADDRESS ANY CHALLENGES, MANY OF WHICH WILL BE 
UNEXPECTED.
 THROUGH ALL THIS, IT IS OUR SAILORS' FIGHTING SPIRIT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO 
ENSURE OUR SUCCESS.

3.  OUR LONG AND ILLUSTRIOUS HISTORY MAKES CLEAR THAT WE CAN OVERCOME  ANY 
OBSTACLE, SEIZE ANY OPPORTUNITY, AND ULTIMATELY PREVAIL NO  MATTER HOW 
DIFFICULT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE.  AS A RESULT OF  UNWAVERING CONTRIBUTIONS OF 
EVERY MEMBER OF OUR NAVY TEAM - OUR  SAILORS, OUR CIVILIANS, OUR RESERVISTS, 
OUR NAVY VETERANS, AND OUR  FAMILIES AT HOME, WE ARE THE FINEST MARITIME FORCE 
THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN.

4.  AS OUR BIRTHDAY IS CELEBRATED AROUND THE GLOBE, I KNOW YOU WILL  CARRY OUR 
PROUD LEGACY WHEREVER YOU GO.  I CANNOT BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW HONORED AND 
PRIVILEGED I AM TO BE YOUR CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.
  HAPPY 236TH BIRTHDAY TO YOU AND TO YOUR FAMILIES.

5.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL GREENERT, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
