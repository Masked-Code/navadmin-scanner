RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the renewal of the Naval Special Warfare 
(NSW) Accession Bonus (NSWAB) for qualified Chief Warrant Officers 
(CWO).  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a).  Accessing NSW CWOs is a 
priority for the Navy.  The NSWAB is part of the Navy overarching effort to 
size, shape and stabilize the NSW force. Special warfare operators or special 
warfare boat operators selected for CWO that meet the eligibility criteria in 
this NAVADMIN may apply. 
 
2.  Program Overview.  This bonus is authorized under Section 332 of 
reference (b).  Eligible CWO selectees may apply for a bonus level of $45,000 
for accepting a commission and serving on Active Duty in designators 7151 and 
7171 for a 4-year bonus obligated service period.  The initial commission 
service obligation for CWO is 6 years and will run concurrent with the bonus 
obligation.  The Naval Special Warfare Plans and Policy Branch (OPNAV N137) 
is designated as the NSWAB Program Manager.  Applicants should submit 
applications for this bonus to the program manager for approval, payment 
processing and tracking prior to commissioning date.  The eligibility 
criteria stated in this NAVADMIN can change at any time by the program 
manager if a bonus reduction is warranted based on the needs of the NSW 
community. 
 
3.  Eligibility.  Applicants must meet the following eligibility criteria: 
    a.  Applicants must be Active-Duty Service Members selected by a Navy CWO 
selection board for commissioning in designators 7151 or 7171 and accept an 
appointment to CWO. 
    b.  Applicants must receive their commanding officers (CO) written 
endorsement.  COs must ensure applications are accurate and verify applicant 
meets eligibility requirements. 
    c.  CWO selectees that accept an appointment to CWO, and that are 
currently on a NSW critical skills retention bonus contract, all ineligible 
to receive or apply for a NSWAB. 
    d.  Upon release of Navy CWO selection NAVADMIN, special warfare 
operators and special warfare boat operators selected and have contracted 
service under a selective reenlistment bonus (SRB) will have future SRB 
payments suspended in line with reference (c).  If an application is accepted 
for CWO appointment, all suspended and future SRB payments are 
forfeited.  The command must coordinate with the servicing Personnel Support 
Detachment to submit a defense workload operations web system transaction to 
Defense Finance and Accounting Services to suspend all future SRB annual 
installments effective the date of commissioning.  This action must be taken 
no later than 45 days prior to the commissioning date to ensure adequate 
processing lead-time to prevent overpayment.  Any SRB annual installments 
disbursed after the commissioning date will be recouped. 
    e.  If applicable, the NSWAB obligation for the Service Member will start 
after completion of the SRB obligated service period for which they were 
previously paid. 
 
4.  Contract Terms.  Qualified applicants will receive a $45,000 bonus, and 
will incur a 4-year Active-Duty bonus service obligation from the date of 
commission, or from the end of SRB service obligation, whichever is 
longer.  NSWAB agreement obligations will run concurrently with any obligated 
service the officer has incurred for education or fellowships such as higher 
education. 
 
5.  Program Execution 
    a.  Applicants must submit their NSWAB request letter, via their chain of 
command, to the program manager no later than 30 days prior to commissioning 
date. 
    b.  Upon acceptance of an agreement, the amount of the bonus becomes 
fixed and the officer incurs a firm service obligation. 
    c.  Service Members will receive the bonus in a lump sum payment. 
 
6.  Application Process 
    a.  Eligible NSW CWO selectees may apply for the NSWAB via their CO to

Section 373 of reference (b), and reference (d).  A Service Member of the 
uniformed services that enters into a written agreement with specified 
service conditions for receipt of a bonus is entitled to the full amount of 
the bonus if the Service Member fulfills the conditions of that written 
agreement.  If the Service Member fails to fulfill the service conditions 
specified in the written agreement for the pay, then the pay may be 
terminated and the Service Member may be required to repay an amount equal to 
the unearned portion of the pay.

management is OPNAV N137 at (703) 604-5008 or via e-mail at
