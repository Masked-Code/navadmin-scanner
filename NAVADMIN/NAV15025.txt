RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes and cancels reference (a).  It does not 
impose a new requirement.  It provides updated guidance and changes the 
*effective from* reporting date for certain sex-related offenses per 
references (b) and (c).  Changes to reference (a) are:
     a.  Submission timeline of Sexual Offense Accountability Record, 
(NAVPERS 1070/887) to a member’s Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) is 
increased from two business days to five business days from adjudication of 
non-judicial punishment (NJP) or at the completion of the appeal process and 
from two business days to five business days from adjudication of a court-
martial.
     b.  Commanders, commanding officers (CO), and officers in charge (OIC) 
are directed to conduct a review and submit NAVPERS 1070/887 for all 
personnel within their command who were convicted at court-martial or awarded 
NJP for any sex-related offenses listed in paragraph 6 since 26 December 
2013.
     c.  Further amplification of these updates are found in paragraphs 5 and 
8 respectively.

2.  Reference (b) requires:
     a.  The inclusion of disposition information on certain sex-related 
offenses in the personnel service records of service members.
     b.  The mandatory review of each service member*s personnel record 
notation of those sex-related offenses by commanders, COs, and OICs of the 
service members.

3.  The purpose of including disposition information on certain sex-related 
offenses in personnel service records is to alert commanders, COs, and OICs 
of members in their commands who received a court-martial conviction or NJP 
for these offenses to reduce the likelihood that repeat offenses will escape 
the notice of commanders, COs, and OICs.

4.  Per references (b) and (c), commanders, COs, and OICs shall submit and 
file NAVPERS 1070/887 in a member*s OMPF where it will remain for the 
duration of his or her career.

5.  NAVPERS 1070/887 will be used to annotate the OMPF of any service member 
who is convicted at court-martial or awarded NJP for sex-related offense(s), 
listed in paragraph 6 below, regardless of recommendation for retention or 
separation from the naval service. The NAVPERS 1070/887 will be submitted 
within five business days of action being determined/adjudication of NJP or 
when the appeal process has been completed and five business days of 
adjudication at court-martial using the e-Submission (e-SUB) application on 
BUPERS Online (BOL) for those with e-Sub access.  Commands without e-SUB 
access will mail NAVPERS 1070/887 to:

Commander
Navy Personnel Command
PERS-313
5720 Integrity Drive
Millington, TN 38055-3130

NAVPERS 1070/887 will be filed in the service member*s OMPF under field code 
91 (FC 91).  Once the OMPF is updated, NAVPERS 1070/887 will be available for 
commanders, COs, and OICs to review using the OMPF command view application 
on BOL.

6.  Commands will document sex-related offenses on NAVPERS 1070/887 to 
include:  violation of Articles 120, 120a, 120b, 120c, or 125 of the Uniform 
Code of Military Justice (UCMJ); or an attempt to commit any of these 
offenses punishable under Article 80 of the UCMJ.

7.  In the Navy, the term punitive administrative action, as delineated in 
references (b) and (c), is limited to punishments imposed by court-martial or 
NJP (e.g., punitive letters of reprimand).  Therefore, the punitive 
administrative action option in NAVPERS 1070/887 is not applicable and should 
not be used.

8.  No later than 2 March 2015, commanders, COs, and OICs shall submit 
NAVPERS 1070/887 for any service member who was convicted at court-martial or 
awarded NJP for any sex-related offense listed in paragraph 6 above since 26 
December 2013.  If a service member has since transferred, it is the 
responsibility of the losing command to complete the NAVPERS 1070/887 for the 
service member, regardless of recommendation for retention or separation from 
the naval service.

9.  Commands will review the OMPF of all permanently assigned and newly 
transferred personnel no later than 3 April 2015 to determine if any service 
member has any documented FC 91 entries.  Commanders, COs, and OICs are 
required to review all documents in FC 91 for all newly reporting personnel 
within 30 days of checking onboard.  In order to identify these documents in 
a member*s record, the OMPF can be sorted by form number NAVPERS 1070/887 or 
by FC 91.

10.  NAVPERS 1070/887 is a fillable form and is available online at the 
following website:  http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/ 
reference/forms/Pages/default.aspx.

11.  These requirements do not supersede any requirements for reporting or 
processing NJP or court-martial actions as required by the MILPERSMAN, 
requirements for reporting incidents of sexual assault stipulated in 
references (d) through (f), or requirements to submit the Sexual Assault 
Disposition Report (NAVPERS 1752/1).

12.  Point of contact is LCDR Christopher Labissiere, OPNAV N17, at (703)604-
6989/DSN 664 or via e-mail at christopher.labissie(at)navy.mil.

13.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
