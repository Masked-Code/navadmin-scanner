RMKS/1.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS NAVADMIN IS TO SOLICIT APPLICATIONS AND 
PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR THE FY08 STA-21 COMMISSIONING PROGRAM.
2.  STA-21 CONSISTS OF THE STA-21 CORE OPTION AND STA-21 TARGET OPTION 
PROGRAMS.  SPECIFIC DETAILS, ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, APPLICATION 
REQUIREMENTS AND SELECTION PROCEDURES CAN BE FOUND IN REF A AND AT THE 
STA-21 WEBSITE UNDER PROGRAM OPTIONS AT HTTPS:

PACKAGES MUST BE POSTMARKED ON OR BEFORE THE DEADLINE DATE.
DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION TO AN APPLICANT S 
PACKAGE IS 1 AUG 07.  NO ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS CAN BE ADDED AFTER THIS 
DATE.  THE SELECTION BOARD WILL MEET 10 SEP 07.
NAMES OF SELECTEES WILL BE ANNOUNCED BY NAVADMIN IN OCT 07.
3.  STA-21 IS A FULL-TIME UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION AND COMMISSIONING 
PROGRAM OPEN TO ENLISTED PERSONNEL OF ALL PAYGRADES AND RATINGS WHO 
MEET ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIED IN REF A AND ON THE STA-21 
WEBSITE UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION LINK.  SELECTEES ARE PROVIDED A

OF CURRENT PAYGRADE.  IN ADDITION, SELECTEES WILL RECEIVE AN EDUCATION 
VOUCHER FOR UP TO 10,000 DOLLARS PER YEAR TO COVER TUITION, FEES, AND 
BOOK COSTS.
4.  LESSONS LEARNED.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ADDRESSES LESSONS 
LEARNED FROM THE FY07 STA-21 SELECTION PROCESS AND BOARD.  THIS 
INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO PRECLUDE COMMON ERRORS.
    A.  OF OVER 800 APPLICATIONS RECEIVED, ONLY 595 WERE BOARD ELIGIBLE.  
A TOTAL OF 200 WERE SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FY07
STA-21 PROGRAM.
    B.  EACH YEAR, PACKAGES ARE STILL NOT CONSIDERED DUE TO NON- 
QUALIFYING SAT/ACT TEST SCORES, NO SAT/ACT TEST SCORES SUBMITTED, NO 
COMMANDING OFFICER (CO) ENDORSEMENT, RECENT NJP, AND MISSING OR 
ILLEGIBLE SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTS.
    C.  MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET BEFORE SUBMITTING 
AN APPLICATION.  THE SELECTION PROCESS IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE.  
APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE MAILED ONLY WHEN FULLY COMPLETE.  OFFICER 
INTERVIEW BOARDS AND THE CO S PERSONAL INTERVIEW SHOULD ONLY BE 
CONDUCTED AFTER THE APPLICATION IS COMPLETE.  THE FULL PICTURE OF AN 
APPLICANT'S ACADEMIC POTENTIAL CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED BY REVIEWING THE 
SAT/ACT SCORES AND HIGH SCHOOL/COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS.
    D.  AN INTERVIEW BOARD AND NOMINATION REVIEW BOARD SHALL BE 
CONDUCTED PER REF A.  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT OFFICERS OF THE APPLICANT 
S DESIGNATOR CHOICE, IF AVAILABLE AT A BASE OR COMMAND, BE ASKED TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERVIEW/NOMINATION REVIEW BOARD TO ASSESS THE 
APPLICANT FOR THEIR COMMUNITY.  NOMINATION REVIEW BOARDS SHOULD BE 
EXTERNAL TO THE COMMAND.  IN THE EVENT THAT A NOMINATION REVIEW BOARD 
OUTSIDE THE COMMAND CANNOT BE CONVENED, THE COMMAND SHOULD PRESENT 
THREE ADDITIONAL INTERVIEW APPRAISALS TO ADD TO THE PACKAGE OR AN 
EXPLANATION OF WHY THE DIRECTED PROCESS COULD NOT BE FOLLOWED.  HOW 
OTHER OFFICERS VIEW THE APPLICANT CARRIES SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT.  FOR 
JUNIOR SAILORS WITH ONLY SCHOOLHOUSE EVALUATIONS, THE CO MUST ADDRESS 
THIS ISSUE IN HIS OR HER ENDORSEMENT.  SAILORS MUST ADDRESS ANY 
HARDSHIPS OR UNIQUE EXPERIENCES THAT SHAPED THEIR CHARACTER AND JUNIOR 
SAILORS SHOULD PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCES.  HIGH 
SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS RARELY PROVIDE IN-DEPTH INFORMATION ON INVOLVEMENT 
IN SPORTS, CLUBS, VOLUNTEER WORK, ETC.
EACH CANDIDATE SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO INCLUDE IN THEIR PERSONAL
STATEMENT REASON(S) FOR THEIR INTEREST IN THE STA-21 PROGRAM, WHAT THEY 
HAVE DONE TO DESERVE CONSIDERATION FOR THIS PROGRAM, AND WHAT THEY 
WOULD DO WITH THE OPPORTUNITY IF SELECTED.  ADDITIONALLY, APPLICANTS 
SHOULD EXPLAIN ANY MITIGATING ISSUES THE BOARD NEEDS TO CONSIDER (I.E., 
POOR HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE GRADES, UNEXPLAINED GAPS, ETC.).
5.  DIVERSITY WITHIN THE NAVY S OFFICER COMMUNITY IS ESSENTIAL.  THE 
NAVY NEEDS LEADERS FROM AND FOR EVERY PART OF OUR NAVY.  I CHALLENGE 
ALL COMMANDING OFFICERS, COMMAND CAREER COUNSELORS AND SENIOR ENLISTED 
MEMBERS TO ENCOURAGE QUALIFIED MINORITY SAILORS TO APPLY FOR THIS 
PROGRAM.
6.  QUESTIONS CONCERNING THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO COMMAND 
CAREER COUNSELORS OR TO NAVAL SERVICE TRAINING COMMAND (OD2), AT DSN
922-9563/9433 OR COMMERCIAL (850) 452-9563/9433 OR EMAILED TO 
PNSC_STA21(AT)NAVY.MIL.
7.  APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE MAILED TO:
    COMMANDER
    NAVAL SERVICE TRAINING COMMAND (OD2/STA-21)
    250 DALLAS STREET STE A
    PENSACOLA FL 32508-5268
