RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the fifth in a series of new updates for 
Transition Goals, Plans, and Success (GPS) and specifically addresses 
implementation of the Transition Military Lifecycle (MLC) model as directed 
by references (a) and (b).

2.  The Transition MLC model is designed to introduce portions of Transition 
GPS curriculum early and throughout the career of service members prior to 
pre-separation counseling or attending the mandatory Transition GPS courses.  
Sailors will also be introduced to the Career Readiness Standards (CRS), 
which are a standardized set of milestones each member must meet prior to 
separation.
For more specific guidance on CRS, go to:
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/career/transition/Pages/TAP.aspx.

3.  The new MLC aligns key transition activities with pre-determined *touch 
points* throughout the career of Sailors.
For enlisted personnel, the career development board (CDB) will be the 
primary means to implement MLC.  For officers, mid-term counseling will be 
utilized as these same *touch points* to discuss MLC topics, in addition to 
normal performance counseling.
Leveraging the current career development processes allows us to incorporate 
facets of the CRS into the MLC without creating a new program or requiring an 
additional process.  The scheduled periodic reviews within the CDB process, 
or mid-term counseling, ensure the Navy will cover Transition GPS at the key 
*touch points* described in paragraph 4 below, and will benefit service 
members who decide to separate or retire by ensuring they are well-prepared 
and more marketable to the civilian sector.  Reference (c) is under revision 
to incorporate transition topics and will provide career counselors the 
information and tools needed to incorporate MLC into CDBs at the required key 
*touch points*.  Information to assist career counselors administer the MLC 
portion of the CDB, in addition to a guide for officers conducting mid-term 
counseling is located at http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/transition/Pages/TAP.aspx.

4.  Key MLC *touch points* include entry level boot camp or accession 
training, first duty station (Active Component) or first home station drill 
weekend (Reserve Component), reenlistment, subsequent duty stations, 18 
months prior to separation (pre-separation counseling, Transition GPS) and 
Capstone (90 days prior to separation).

5.  MLC topics addressed at key *touch points* include Servicemembers Group 
Life Insurance election, eBenefits Registration, Individual Career 
Development Plan, Budget Preparation/Personal Finance, Active-Duty VA 
Benefits, Military Occupational Crosswalk (credentialing and certification 
opportunities), Off-Duty Voluntary Education, Continuum of Service (Reserve 
Affiliation), GI Bill transferability/VA Home Loan/Education Benefits.

whichever occurs first.
