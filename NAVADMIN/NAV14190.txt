RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN establishes commanding officers (CO) and officers-in-
charge (OIC), waiver tuition assistance (TA) recommendation authority and 
outlines the updated reimbursement policy for TA, promulgated by reference 
(a).  It augments the TA policy sections of reference (b).

2.  Policy update for first permanent duty station TA restriction.
Effective immediately, COs and OICs may approve waivers to the requirement 
for members onboard one-year in their first permanent duty station before 
using TA.  Required TA prerequisites are:
    a.  Receive education counseling by a Navy College counselor at a Navy 
College Office (NCO) or via the Virtual Education Center (VEC).
    b.  Have an education plan approved by a Navy education counselor.
    c.  Receive the command*s leadership triad endorsement.

3.  TA reimbursement policy.  The minimum-required grade level has changed.  
Reimbursement will be required from the service member if a successful course 
completion is not obtained.  For the purpose of reimbursement, a successful 
course completion is defined as a grade of *C* or higher for undergraduate 
courses, a *B* or higher for graduate courses, and a *Pass* for *Pass/Fail* 
grades.
Reimbursement will also be required from the service member if he or she 
fails to make up a grade of *I* (incomplete) within the time limits 
stipulated by the educational institution or six months after the completion 
of the class, whichever comes first.  Per reference (a), the minimum grade 
point average levels have not changed.

4.  Covered charges now include those that are submitted to the Navy by the 
educational institution for tuition only.  Educational institutions that 
bundle tuition, fees, or books into a consolidated cost, must detail the 
charges for fees and books separately for service members participating in 
the TA program.  Fees include any charge not directly related to course 
instructions including:  cost associated with room, board, distance learning, 
equipment, supplies, books/materials, exams, insurance, parking, 
transportation, admissions, registration, or fines.  TA funds are not to be 
used for the purchase of books to include textbooks, eBooks, CDs/DVDs, or 
reference or instructional materials.

5.  The TA reimbursement policy is effective for all courses with start dates 
after 1 October 2014.

6.  Point of contact is Mr. Fred Drummond at (703) 604-3574/DSN 664 or via e-
mail at fred.drummond(at)navy.mil.

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
