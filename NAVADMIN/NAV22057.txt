RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22) Training and 
Administration of the Reserve (TAR) Aviation Department Head Retention Bonus 
(ADHRB) Program in line with reference (a).  A vital part of developing a 
total force strategy and maintaining combat readiness is to provide 
appropriate incentives to retain skilled personnel for critical naval 
aviation enterprise billets. The TAR ADHRB Program provides selected bonuses 
as an incentive to eligible pilots and naval flight officers serving in 
department head (DH) billets during FY22 and to retain those officers through 
a post-DH aviation staff tour. 
 
2.  The TAR ADHRB Program continues the bonus system of previous years that 
is tied directly to force structure and targets initial eligible 
aviators.  Annual DH rates of up to 35,000 dollars are listed below and vary 
by community.  DH retention bonuses will be paid in three or five equal 
annual installments.  If a signed contract is received before completing 12 
months of their initial DH tour, the service member is eligible for the five 
year contract beginning on his/her one-year anniversary in the DH squadron. 
Service Members may sign up for the three year contract at any time during 
their initial DH tour, but will not be approved until after his/her one-year 
anniversary in the DH squadron.  The following are the monetary dollar rates 
for squadron DH contracts: 
 
    HM - Pilot                     25,000 dollars/YR 
    HSC - Pilot                    15,000 dollars/YR 
    HSM - Pilot                    35,000 dollars/YR 
    HT - Pilot                     15,000 dollars/YR 
    VAQ - Pilot/NFO                15,000 dollars/YR 
    VFA/C - Pilot/NFO              35,000 dollars/YR
