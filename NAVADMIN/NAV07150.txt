203/05, SENIOR ENLISTED EDUCATION INITIATIVE-ASSOCIATES DEGREE FOR E-8 
ELIGIBILITY FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011 SELECTION BOARD.// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THAT THE REQUIREMENT TO POSSESS AN 
ASSOCIATE S DEGREE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR ADVANCEMENT TO E-8 HAS BEEN 
RESCINDED.  REF A IS CANCELLED.
2.  A NINE-MONTH POLICY REVIEW RECOMMENDED BETTER BALANCING OF CURRENT 
OPERATIONS AND ADVANCEMENT REQUIREMENTS.  THIS REVIEW ALSO RECOMMENDED 
(AND CNO-APPROVED) MITIGATING THE RISK THAT MANY OF OUR CHIEF PETTY 
OFFICERS FACE IN NOT MEETING THE DEADLINE TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE 
BEFORE THE FY-11 E-8 SELECTION BOARDS BY CANCELLING THIS REQUIREMENT.  
MANY OF THESE CHIEFS ARE IN OUR MOST SEA- AND GWOT-INTENSIVE RATINGS.  
PLACING THESE LEADERS AT A DISADVANTAGE FOR ADVANCEMENT DOES NOT 
COMPLEMENT THE EMPHASIS THAT BOTH CNO AND MCPON PLACE ON THE IMPORTANCE 
OF DECKPLATE LEADERSHIP.
3.  OUR NAVY REMAINS STRONGLY COMMITTED TO EDUCATION.  WHILE SAILORS 
ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED TO POSSESS AN ASSOCIATES DEGREE TO BE BOARD 
ELIGIBLE FOR E-8, THE IMPORTANCE THAT EDUCATION PLAYS IN ENHANCING THE 
SKILLS WE NEED IN OUR SENIOR ENLISTED LEADERS WILL REMAIN A 
CONSIDERATION IN SELECTION BOARDS AS WELL AS IN THE ADVANCEMENT PROCESS 
FOR ALL SAILORS.  IN ADDITION, EFFECTIVE WITH THE AUGUST/SEPTEMBER 2008 
ENLISTED ADVANCEMENT CYCLE, E3-E5 SAILORS WILL EARN FINAL MULTIPLE 
POINTS TO RECOGNIZE COMPLETION OF FORMAL EDUCATION.  THOSE SAILORS WHO 
ALREADY PURSUED PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AND WORKED HARD TO EARN AN 
ASSOCIATES DEGREE (OR HIGHER) ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND SHOULD BE 
ASSURED THAT THEIR EFFORTS WILL BE POSITIVELY CONSIDERED WHEN THEY 
COMPETE FOR ADVANCEMENT.
4.  POINT OF CONTACT IS MS. ANN HUNTER, VOLUNTARY EDUCATION LEAD, AT
(850) 452-8956 OR EMAIL AT ANN.HUNTER(AT)NAVY.MIL.
