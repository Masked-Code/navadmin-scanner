5.  Eligibility:
    a. Designated Naval Aviators and NFOs through the grade of lieutenant 
commander are eligible for selection.
    b. The preferred Unrestricted Line (URL) (13XX) aviators are junior 
officers (O-2 or O-3) with forecasted timing to complete the selected TPS 
program and a minimum 24-month follow-on test tour prior to their expected 
department head tour.  In the event that there are insufficient quantities of 
qualified URL junior officers to meet requirements, URL lieutenant commanders 
with exceptional records may be selected, provided they would still be able 
to meet applicable career milestones.
    c. Due to test squadron shore tour lengths and follow on department head 
screening board timing considerations, only Strike Fighter (VFA) Naval 
Aviators (1310) and VFA NFOs (1320) junior to lineal number 15183500 will be 
considered for selection.
    d. Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer (1510) aviators through the grade 
of lieutenant commander may be selected if able to serve a minimum 24-month 
flight test tour following graduation from TPS and continue to meet career 
milestones.   
    e. Applicants determined to have insufficient career timing to complete 
TPS and a minimum 24-month follow-on test tour may have their application 
removed from consideration prior to board convening, if sufficient quantity 
and quality of URL officers are met.

6.  Applicants should periodically check for updates and additional 
information at the TPS board website:  www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
