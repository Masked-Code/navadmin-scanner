RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a) and establishes the Fiscal 
Year 2016 (FY16) Cybersecurity (CS) awareness training requirement for all 
Navy personnel as set forth in references (b) through (e).  Proper network 
discipline is critical to maintaining network security and integrity.  
Failure to accomplish annual training introduces unnecessary operational risk 
and will result in loss of network access.

2.  All Department of the Navy military (as per the General Military Training 
Schedule (NAVADMIN 213/15)), civilians, and contractors with access to 
Unclassified, Secret, and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) networks 
must satisfy the FY16 training requirement.  Cyber Awareness Challenge (CAC) 
Version 3 (V3) released February 2016, is the required FY16 DoD authorized 
awareness training for users with access to unclassified and secret networks.

3.  The Office of the Director of National Intelligence requires Navy 
Intelligence Community personnel with access to information and information 
systems that process, store, and/or transmit SCI information applicable to 
both those connected to the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications 
System or standalone as well as those directly supporting Director of Naval 
Intelligence initiatives to complete IC-CAC V2 to satisfy the FY16 
requirement; CAC V3 does not contain the tasks required of the IC covered in 
IC-CAC V2.

4.  Authorized methods for training delivery:
       a.  Total Workforce Management Service (TWMS), 
https://twms.navy.mil/selfservice/login.asp;
       b.  Navy e-Learning (NEL) via the Navy Knowledge Online portal;
       c.  CAC V3 is available at: 
http://iatraining.disa.mil/eta/cyberchallenge_v3_fy15/launchPage.htm
       d.  IC-CAC V2 is available at:
http://iatraining.disa.mil/eta/cyberchallenge/launchpage.htm
       e.  Other approved training sources, include general military lectures 
delivered by a certified Information Security Systems Managers (ISSM) and 
Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Digital Video Discs.

5.  Deploying commands must make every effort to complete the training prior 
to deployment.  Afloat commands with limited bandwidth may access the annual 
training from the ship's Navy e-Learning afloat (NEL) application hosted on 
the Navy Information/Application Product Suite server, eliminating the need 
to reach back to shore hosted NEL websites.  Commands may also order CS 
awareness training compact discs from DISA via, 
http://iasecontent.disa.mil/eta/products_order_form.pdf.

6.  Although, CS awareness training is an individual responsibility, 
Commanders and Commanding Officers are accountable for 100 percent 
certification of their personnel.  Echelon II Command ISSM and training 
officers are responsible for tracking and reporting compliance to meet annual 
Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 requirements.

7.  Command training officers must validate training via the TWMS or Fleet 
Training Management and Planning System, 
(https://ntmpsweb.ncdc.navy.mil/Fltmps/) authoritative database.  Training 
officers will manually input training completed via NEL or AILE.  Report 
discrepancies to the Navy Training Management Planning System Operational 
Support office at ntmps.support(AT)navy.mil or 1-866-438-2898/DSN 922-1867.

8.  Echelon II training officers are responsible for maintaining a list of 
personnel which have fulfilled the training requirement in addition to  
compiling data in TWMS for their respective area of responsibility.  The 
command ISSM shall disable the accounts of users who fail to complete the 
training by 01 July 2016.

9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.

10.  Released by VADM Ted N. Branch, Deputy Chief of Naval Operation for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.// UNCLASSIFIED//
