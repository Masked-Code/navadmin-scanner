RMKS/1.  This message supersedes reporting guidance in ref (b) para 4, and 
supplements reporting guidance in ref (a) for COVID-19 reporting only. 
 
2. This NAVADMIN provides updated reporting guidance while the Navy continues 
to operate in a COVID-19 environment. All OPREP-3 messages sent related to 
COVID-19, will be reported as detailed in paragraph 4, and must include CNO 
WASHINGTON DC as an action addee as well as all addees required in ref (b) 
and required by Echelon 2 and 3 commanders. This message supersedes the 
reporting guidance in ref (b). The reporting guidance is significantly 
enhanced to better understand COVID-19 positive, suspect COVID-19 cases, 
and command actions at sea. 
 
3. APPLICABILITY. This message applies to all Navy units responsible for 
service members, both active duty and reservists, and Navy civilian 
employees. 
 
4. DEFINITIONS.  To maintain uniformity and consistency of reports, the 
following definitions are provided. 
 
4.A. Person under investigation (PUI): Anyone suspected of COVID-19, being 
monitored for COVID-19 without diagnosis by a health care provider or in 
close contact with a positive tested individual. 
 
4.B. POSITIVE CASE: a positive COVID-19 test or diagnosis of COVID-19 by a 
healthcare provider. 
 
4.C. RECOVERED: A previously reported COVID-19 positive case that is no 
longer positive IAW CDC or OPNAV guidelines. 
 
4.D. RESTRICTION OF MOVEMENT (ROM):  ROM guidance is updated in Ref (c). 
 
5. COVID-19 REPORTING. Guidance below is for reporting to OPNAV directly from 
all Navy Echelon 2 and below commands. Reporting guidance provided by Fleet 
Commanders to subordinate commands is unchanged by this guidance. Paragraph 
5.a. is for the Fleet Commander reports to OPNAV. Paragraph 5.b. provides 
OPNAV CCIR reporting guidance, definitions and guidance for all command 
reports. Paragraph 5.c. provides a reporting template and required 
information descriptions to capture required information. For CONUS commands, 
ensure points of contact (POC) continue to submit accurate and timely COVID-
19 reports to USFFC and OPNAV, with an information copy to the local 
installation commander. For OCONUS commands, ensure POCs submit accurate and 
timely COVID-19 daily reports to Navy Component Command/Echelon 2 Commander 
and OPNAV, with an information copy to the local installation commander. 
Given potential rapid escalation of case numbers and impact on readiness 
(especially underway), additional reporting is required. Navy commands will 
report the following through the chain of command and OPREP-3 ensuring both 
CNO Washington DC and appropriate Echelon 2 commanders are included: 
 
5.A. Fleet Update Reporting.  USFFC, COMNAVEUR/AF, COMNAVCENT, COMNAVSOUTH 
will report to OPNAV by 1500Q daily and COMPACFLT will report by 0100Q daily 
with the following information by Active-Duty, DON, Civilian, Military Family 
Member and Navy Contractors. Civilian employee authorized dependents overseas 
are counted in the dependents category.  Midshipmen, drilling and mobilized 
reserves and coalition forces are included in the Active-Duty category. 
 
5.A.1. Current Active Positive Cases/Total Currently Hospitalized/Total in 
ROM/Total Recovered/Total Deaths/Current total Persons Under Investigation 
(PUI). 
 
5.A.2. Reporting the historical total number of cases is not required and is 
assumed to equal active cases plus recovered cases plus deaths. If this is 
not the case, highlight with a detailed explanation (e.g. Sailor previously 
reported as recovered but subsequently had a positive COVID-19 test 
(relapsed)). 
 
5.A.3. Review past reports prior to submission. Any anomalies must include a 
detailed explanation (e.g. Starting on (date), one case was reported as a 
military dependent, this case is actually a government civilian and has been 
moved to that category for tracking, effective (date)).  Do not resubmit past 
data, provide the correction going forward. 
 
5.B. CCIRs. READ REPORTING REQUIREMENTS CAREFULLY AS THEY HAVE BEEN UPDATED 
SIGNIFICANTLY. 
 
5.B.1. All commands will send OPREP-3 series messages to CNO Washington DC 
and parent Echelon 2 commands for all Military (Active and Reserve) and 
civilian (in accordance with HIPAA and the Privacy Act) members who test 
positive for COVID-19. 
 
5.B.2. Each OPREP-3 will be formatted and contain the information in 
paragraph 4.C at a minimum, and each command will provide updates VIA OPREP-3 
as information changes. 
 
5.B.3. OPREP-3 updates are required for each change in status (e.g. admitted 
to or discharged from the hospital, placed in or discharged from the ICU, 
placed on a ventilator or removed from the ventilator). 
 
5.B.4. Ensure the original OPREP-3 date time group is included in the 
references. 
 
5.B.5. The OPREP-3 will be closed (FINAL) with the report of the individual 
as recovered from COVID-19. 
 
5.B.6. Multiple individuals may be reported on a single message with a 
separate paragraph for each individual containing required information. 
 
5.B.7. Commands with embarked detachments or subordinate commands shall be 
the reporting command for all embarked commands, clearly delineating the 
individual's home command. 
 
5.B.8. If information is unknown for the initial OPREP, list as UNKNOWN and 
update within 48 hours.  When reporting the time, use the actual time zone 
designation vice "L" indicating local time. 
 
5.C. Template. The following template is provided as the body of the message 
with example entries for clarification only. If multiple Sailors are being 
reported in a single message, each sailor (or civilian) will have a separate 
paragraph.
