RMKS/1. The Air Traffic Control Association (ATCA) will hold the Multi-
Service Air Traffic Control (ATC) Symposium in Myrtle Beach, SC at the 
Sheraton Convention Center from 1-4 Jun 2020 with activities commencing the 
evening of 1 Jun 2020.  This forum provides a vehicle for senior military and 
civilian professionals to enlighten, inspire, enhance retention and educate

operational enhancements and policy changes that have taken place within the
