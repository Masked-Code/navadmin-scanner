SUBJ/U.S. NAVAL TEST PILOT SCHOOL SHORT COURSE FLEET SEAT FY-20 OFFERINGS AND 
ORGANIZATION//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School
(USNTPS) Short Course Fleet Seat (SCFS) FY-20 offerings and organization.  
The USNTPS SCFS offers 2 week courses designed to be a high-level exposure to 
the discipline of flight test.  The courses are a mixture of academic 
classroom periods and applied exercises, conducted at Naval Air Station 
Patuxent River or Naval Air Station China Lake.  USNTPS funds course tuition 
for a limited number of seats per year.

2.  The USNTPS SCFS program allows fleet aviators to participate in
2 week long courses focused on key elements of specific developmental test 
topics within the Naval Air (NAVAIR) enterprise.
Course attendees consist of a diverse community of fleet aviators, NAVAIR 
engineers, contractors and international partners.  Fleet aviators gain 
insight into the critical role of development test in delivering warfighting 
capabilities heading to the fleet, while NAVAIR engineers gain insight into 
fleet operations and aircrew considerations, ultimately enriching the 
learning environment and positively affecting future developmental test 
programs and projects.  Fleet aviators are able to assess their own potential 
interest in developmental test career opportunities, and return to their 
commands with information and insight of developmental test to share with 
others.

3.  To be considered eligible to participate, candidates must be USN/USMC 
military aviators physically qualified to fly.

4.  Commands (or administrative chain of command activities) are responsible 
for funding and scheduling travel for SCFS attendees.
USNTPS will fund the course tuition, but is not responsible for any travel 
costs incurred.

5.  SCFS offerings include Introduction to Unmanned Aerial Systems Flight 
Test (CTE-TPS-UAS), Introduction to Aircraft and Systems Test and Evaluation 
(CTE-TPS-SYS), Introduction to Fixed Wing Flying Qualities and Performance 
(CTE-TPS-XFQ) and Introduction to Rotary Wing Flying Qualities and 
Performance (CTE-TPS-RFQ).  The SCFS FY-20 offerings are currently scheduled
