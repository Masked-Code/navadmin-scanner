RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Aviation 
Department Head Retention Bonus (ADHRB).  The FY-21 Aviation Command 
Retention Bonus (ACRB) will be addressed via a separate NAVADMIN. 
 
2.  A vital part of developing a total force strategy and maintaining combat 
readiness is to provide appropriate incentives to retain skilled personnel 
for critical Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) billets.  The Active Component 
(AC) Aviation Bonus (AvB) program, consisting of the ADHRB and ACRB, 
incentivizes highly talented, hard-working, career-minded naval aviators and 
naval flight officers (NFO) to choose to remain on Active Duty.  Our return 
on investment is the retention for continued Navy service of our aviation 
warfighters, with their invaluable, irreplaceable skillsets and leadership. 
 
3.  AC ADHRB 
    a.  Capable and dedicated department heads are vital to mission 
effectiveness and represent the important link between senior leadership and 
junior personnel.  Retaining the experience and talent associated with those 
eligible to serve as aviation department heads greatly benefits the continued 
success of the NAE. 
    b.  The AC ADHRB eligibility criterion includes selection for lieutenant 
commander (LCDR) and the FY-21 ADHRB is intended for officers selected for 
promotion to LCDR in the FY-21 LCDR statutory board.  These officers will be 
considered for department head in the FY-22 Aviation Department Head Screen 
Board (ADHSB) scheduled to convene in the spring of 2021.  Additionally, 
eligible officers must have an Active Duty service obligation (ADSO) 
associated with undergraduate flight training ending in FY-19 or 
later.  Please consult the program information for a full listing of 
eligibility criteria.  The application opportunity commences with the release 
of this NAVADMIN and closes on 31 August 2021. 
    c.  Contracts are offered with either a three or five-year obligation 
that begins upon expiration of the officers winging ADSO or contract 
approval, whichever is later.  The intent is to provide flexibility when 
making career decisions and to encourage officers to fulfill a department 
head tour and continue naval service. 
    d.  The Navy values an early commitment and a five-year obligation.  An 
officer who submits a five-year contract prior to the ADHSB results being 
published will receive the maximum annual rate specific to their 
type/model/series and designator (T/M/S+D). 
If an officer prefers a three-year contract or wishes to wait until the ADHSB 
selection results are public, the ADHRB annual amount reduces by $5,000 per 
year. 
    e.  While all aviators that complete milestone assignments are equally 
valued, specific T/M/S+D rates vary according to respective community 
inventory health.  Those communities experiencing the greatest retention 
challenges are incentivized with the highest rates.  AC ADHRB retention bonus 
pay rates for FY-21 include:
