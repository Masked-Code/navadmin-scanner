SUBJ/GENERAL DETAILED TRANSITION STRATEGY//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THE NAVY IS MAKING A COMMITMENT TO INVEST
UP-FRONT IN OUR PEOPLE BY PROVIDING ALL FUTURE SAILORS WITH FORMAL
SCHOOL TRAINING AS PART OF THEIR NAVAL CAREERS.  THIS INITIATIVE
PROVIDES OUR FLEET GENDETS EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO BE RATED WITH OR
WITHOUT "A" SCHOOL DEPENDING ON THEIR DESIRES, QUALIFICATIONS, AND
THE NAVY'S NEEDS.

2.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES NAVY'S PLAN TO ELIMINATE AIRMAN GENERAL
DETAILED (GENDET) ACCESSIONS BEGINNING FY06, THE BUSINESS RULES,
IMPLEMENTATION DATES FOR TRANSITION OF UNDESIGNATED AIRMAN, AND A
THREE-YEAR PHASE OUT (EXIT STRATEGY) PLAN ENDING 30 SEPTEMBER 2008.
THE SAME BUSINESS RULES BELOW WILL APPLY TO ALL GENDETS (FIREMAN,
AIRMAN, AND SEAMAN) UNTIL ALL ARE TRANSITIONED BY THE END OF FY09.
3.  AIRMAN GENDET PHASE OUT BEGINS FY06, ANTICIPATE SEAMAN GENDETS
TO FOLLOW A SIMILAR STRATEGY BEGINNING FY07.  TRANSITION OF AIRMAN
GENDETS LEVERAGES OUR SEA WARRIOR TRAINING AND RECRUITING (STAR-21)
REVOLUTION INITIATIVES BY PROVIDING ALL AIRMAN RECRUITED AFTER 1
OCTOBER 2005 WITH A PROFESSIONAL CAREER PATH.  COMMANDER, NAVY
PERSONNEL COMMAND (COMNAVPERSCOM) ANTICIPATES TRANSITIONING THE
REMAINING 11,000 AIRMAN GENDETS INTO RATINGS OVER THE NEXT THREE
YEARS.  ENLISTED COMMUNITY MANAGERS (ECM), DETAILERS, AND THE QUOTA
MANAGEMENT OFFICE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE OUR SAILORS AND
COMMANDS WITH AN AGGRESSIVE REASSIGNMENT "STRIKING" PLAN WHICH WILL
MAXIMIZE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AND SUPPORT READINESS.
4.  COMMANDING OFFICERS, COMMAND MASTER CHIEFS, AND COMMAND CAREER
COUNSELORS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE TRANSITION OF GENDETS TO RATED
SAILORS THROUGH PROACTIVE MENTORSHIP AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT

PROGRAMS.  COMMANDS MUST CONDUCT INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT OF RATING
QUALIFICATIONS AND CAREER GOALS FOR EACH GENDET SAILOR ASSIGNED IN
ORDER TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROFESSIONAL GROWTH.  OPTIONS
MUST BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CAREER REENLISTMENT OBJECTIVES AND RATING
FOR GENERAL APPRENTICES (CREO/REGA), ESTABLISHED STRIKING/
DESIGNATION PROCEDURES, AND PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) POLICIES.
ACADEMIC SKILLS DEVELOPMENT AND ARMED FORCES CLASSIFICATION TESTING
(AFCT)/RETESTING SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED AND SCHEDULED WELL IN ADVANCE
TO ENABLE GENDETS TO MAXIMIZE THEIR CAREER OPTIONS.  ACADEMIC SKILLS
OPTIONS THROUGH THE NAVY COLLEGE PROGRAM AT
HTTPS:(SLANT:SLANT)WWW.NAVYCOLLEGE.NAVY.MIL/NCP/FINDNCO.CFM INCLUDE
SELF-PACED COURSES AT NAVY COLLEGE LEARNING CENTERS, ARRANGEMENT FOR
INSTRUCTORS TO TRAVEL TO SHORE BASED SITES FOR GROUPS OF FIVE OR
MORE, AND REQUESTS FOR SHIPBOARD INSTRUCTORS THROUGH THE PACE AFLOAT
PROGRAM.  FOLLOWING ACADEMIC PREPARATION, SAILORS MAY TAKE THE AFCT
AT AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL SUPPORT ACTIVITY DETACHMENTS (PSD) AND
SHIPBOARD TEST SITES PER NAVADMIN 161/04.
5.  COMNAVPERSCOM MANDATES USE OF THE FLEET RATING IDENTIFICATION
ENGINE (FLT RIDE) TO CONDUCT WHOLE PERSON ASSESSMENT AND RATING
ELIGIBILITY SCREENING.  ADDITIONALLY, FLT RIDE PROVIDES THE



PAGE 04 RUEWMFU2890 UNCLAS
CAPABILITY TO SCREEN SAILORS FOR ALL RATINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY AND
BY CREO GROUP.  BASIC PERSONNEL DATA FOR ALL GENDETS HAS BEEN
PRE-POPULATED INTO FLT RIDE INCLUDING SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (SSN),
NAME, RATE, ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE DATE (ADSD), GENDER, AND MOST
RECENT ARMED FORCES VOCATIONAL APTITUDE BATTERY (ASVAB)/AFCT DATA AS
REFLECTED IN THE ENLISTED MASTER FILE.  IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
EACH COMMAND TO VERIFY THAT PRE-POPULATED DATA IS CORRECT AND ENSURE
THAT THE SAILOR'S MEDICAL, LEGAL, AND PERSONAL HISTORY SUCH AS
CITIZENSHIP AND SECURITY CLEARANCE ELIGIBILITY DATA IS VERIFIED AND
ENTERED PRIOR TO RATING ELIGIBILITY SCREENING.  PARTICULAR ATTENTION
MUST BE PAID TO THE ASVAB DATA.  WHEN DISCREPANCIES ARE DISCOVERED
BETWEEN THE FIELD SERVICE RECORD ASVAB INFORMATION CONTAINED ON
NAVPERS 1070/604 AND THE PRE-POPULATED FLT RIDE RECORD, UPDATE FLT
RIDE WITH THE FIELD SERVICE RECORD ASVAB SCORES TO CONDUCT
SCREENING.  COUNSELORS SHOULD THEN CONTACT THE SERVICING PSD/
PERSONNEL OFFICE TO ENSURE UPDATE OF THE ENLISTED MASTER FILE TO
REFLECT MOST CURRENT ASVAB DATA USING NSIPS TRANSACTION, NAVY
ENSLISTED SYSTEM (NES) UPDATE, OR BY FAXING A CORRECTED NAVPERS
1070/604 TO THE NSIPS HELPDESK IN ACCORDANCE WITH NAVADMIN 161/04.
COMMANDS NEED ONLY A WEB BROWSER AND THE WEB ADDRESS TO ACCESS FLT

RIDE AND ITS ROBUST USER HELP GUIDES, ON-LINE USER GUIDES, AND
TUTORIALS.  FLT RIDE ACCOUNT REQUESTS AND ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE
ADDRESSED TO THE NAVY SELECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OFFICE.  POC:
MIKE BREH AT (703) 695-6251/DSN 225 OR EMAIL AT
MICHAEL.BREH@NAVY.MIL.
6.  THE GOAL IS TO DESIGNATE ALL AIRMAN AND REMAINING FIREMAN
GENDETS BASED ON ADSD USING THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES:
ADSD               TRANSITION DEADLINE
MORE THAN 24 MOS   30 SEPTEMBER 2006
12-24 MOS          30 SEPTEMBER 2007
LESS THAN 12 MOS   30 SEPTEMBER 2008
COMPUTE TOTAL SERVICE BY SUBTRACTING ADSD FROM 1 OCT 2005.
COMNAVPERSCOM INTENDS TO HELP ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION PLAN
BY PROVIDING A GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR DESIGNATION THROUGH THE
NAVY-WIDE ADVANCEMENT EXAMINATION PASSED BUT NOT ADVANCED (PNA)
POPULATION.  ADDITIONALLY, IN CASES WHERE A MEMBER DEMONSTRATES A
PARTICULAR APTITUDE FOR A RATING AND EXHIBITS EXCEPTIONAL CAREER
POTENTIAL, COMMANDING OFFICERS MAY RECOMMEND GENDET DESIGNATION
THROUGH THE ECM, PER THE GUIDELINES OUTLINED IN MILPERSMAN 1306-618,
USING NAVPERS 1306/7.  IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN COMMUNITY HEALTH AND



PAGE 06 RUEWMFU2890 UNCLAS
ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FINAL APPROVAL AUTHORITY RESIDES WITH THE
ECM.
7.  COMMANDER, FLEET FORCES COMMAND (COMFLTFORCOM) WILL COORDINATE
ACTIONS BY COMMANDER, NAVAL AIR FORCES AND COMMANDER, NAVAL SURFACE
FORCES TO EFFECT DESIGNATION OF AIRMAN AND REMAINING FIREMAN.
COMFLTFORCOM WILL SUBMIT A PROGRESS REPORT TO COMNAVPERSCOM
BEGINNNING IN OCTOBER 2005, AND QUARTERLY THEREAFTER UNTIL ALL
ACTIONS ARE COMPLETED.
8.  ELIMINATION OF THE CURRENT GENDET INVENTORIES IS A CHALLENGING
INITIATIVE THAT WILL ACHIEVE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, INCREASE
ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY, AND TAKE THE NAVY TO AN ALL PROFESSIONAL
WORKFORCE.
