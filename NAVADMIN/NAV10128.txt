EVOLVE TO ENSURE PERFORMANCE-BASED OPPORTUNITY IS MAINTAINED FOR OUR BEST AND 
BRIGHTEST SAILORS WHILE SHAPING THE NAVY FORCE TO MEET FUTURE REQUIREMENTS.  
ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMAND LEADERSHIP TEAM SHOULD READ THIS NAVADMIN IN ITS 
ENTIRETY, BE THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR WITH THE PTS PROGRAM AND REMAIN FULLY ENGAGED 
IN THE CONDUCT OF TIMELY CAREER DEVELOPMENT BOARDS, COUNSELING AND MENTORING. 
POLICY AND PROCEDURE CHANGES IN THIS NAVADMIN WILL ENSURE MAXIMUM PTS REVIEWS

DISTRIBUTED EFFICIENTLY FOR ALL ZONE A, B AND C SAILORS.

2. POLICY CHANGES.
    A.  COMMANDS SHALL SUBMIT PTS APPLICATIONS FOR ALL E3-E6 SAILORS WITH LESS 
THAN 14 YEARS OF SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR CAREER INTENTIONS.
        (1) SUBMIT APPLICATIONS NOT LATER THAN 13 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE SAILOR'S 
EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE (EAOS) OR PROJECTED ROTATION DATE (PRD) 
IF OBLISERV IS REQUIRED, WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST.
        (2) EARLY APPLICATION:  COMMANDS MAY STILL SUBMIT PTS APPLICATIONS UP 
TO
15 MONTHS PRIOR TO EAOS/PRD IF CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT (E.G., IMMINENT 
DEPLOYMENT, SPECIAL PROGRAMS, OR DECOMMISSIONING).  WHEN APPLYING EARLY, 
UTILIZE THE EARLY APPLY INDICATOR ON THE APPLICATION. 
        (3) SUBMIT APPLICATIONS FOR SAILORS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR REENLISTMENT BY 
SELECTING "NO" IN RESPONSE TO QUESTION ONE ("IS MEMBER ELIGIBLE FOR 
REENLISTMENT"). 
THIS ENABLES ACCOUNTABILITY OF ALL SAILORS.
   B.  APPLICATIONS FOR SELECTED RESERVE (SELRES) QUOTAS MAY BE SUBMITTED 
BETWEEN
15 MONTHS AND 3 MONTHS PRIOR TO EAOS (AS EXTENDED).  SAILORS WITH DUAL QUOTAS 
(ACTIVE AND SELRES) MUST CANCEL THE QUOTA THEY DO NOT INTEND TO USE.
        (1) QUOTA AVAILABILITY FOR SELRES RATINGS IS LOCATED ON THE CAREER 
OPPORTUNITY MATRIX.  SELRES OPTION SAILORS ARE ALLOWED TO APPLY, VIA CMS-ID, 
FOR A NAVY OPERATIONAL SUPPORT CENTER (NOSC) LOCATION. 
        (2) SAILORS DESIRING A SELRES OPTION QUOTA WILL BE PLACED INTO THE 
APPROPRIATE  ZONE CATEGORY BASED ON THEIR PAY ENTRY BASE DATE (PEBD).  SELRES 
OPTION SAILORS COMPETE FOR QUOTAS IN THE FISCAL YEAR OF THEIR EAOS (AS 
EXTENDED). 
        (3) REGARDLESS OF A SAILOR'S CAREER INTENTIONS, LEARNING OF THE 
BENEFITS OF THE SELECTED RESERVE ALLOWS A SAILOR TO MAKE A PROPERLY-INFORMED 
DECISION ABOUT SUBMITTING A SELRES OPTION APPLICATION.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
ABOUT PTS WITH SELRES OPTION CAN BE FOUND ON THE PTS WEBSITE:  
HTTP://WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/CAREERINFO/PERFORMTOSERVE.
    C.  PTS QUOTAS ARE LIMITED AND MUST BE RESERVED FOR OUR BEST AND BRIGHTEST 
SAILORS WHO DESIRE TO STAY NAVY.  ONCE A QUOTA HAS BEEN PROVIDED, THE 
FOLLOWING PROCEDURES WILL BE UTILIZED TO VALIDATE SAILORS' INTENTIONS AND TO 
RESCIND QUOTAS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO UNUSED:
        (1) COMMANDS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A NAVPERS 1070/613 (PAGE 13) TO 
BUPERS-32 (ENLISTED COMMUNITY MANAGER) WHEN A SAILOR WHO RECEIVES AN IN-RATE

QUOTA.  THE PTS SYSTEM WILL REFLECT THE INTENTION TO SEPARATE AND THE QUOTA 
WILL BECOME AVAILABLE FOR ANOTHER SAILOR.

REMAIN ON ACTIVE DUTY," IS CANCELLED.
        (3) SAILORS WITH AN ACTIVE DUTY RESERVATION WHO FAIL TO NEGOTIATE 
ORDERS WILL HAVE THEIR PTS RESERVATION CANCELLED FOUR MONTHS PRIOR TO THE

    E.  FOR ALL ZONES, COMMANDS SHALL UTILIZE THE LAST TWO REGULAR PERIODIC 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS WHEN SUBMITTING PTS APPLICATIONS.
