Director, Military Personnel Plans and Policy (OPNAV N13).  All waivers must 
be submitted to the DCSELMO by 8 November 2023, to allow time for final 
adjudication and inclusion in a candidate package to the board. 
    e.  All TAR and SELRES candidates (including closed loop ratings and TAR 
serving at AC commands) must obtain the Navy Reserve FORCM's validation prior 
to submission.  Candidate packages are due to the Office of the Chief of Navy

Reserve FORCM to the DCSELMO via encrypted e-mail to cselboard@us.navy.mil. 
 
4.  For record review and communication with the CMDCM and CMDCS Screen 
Board, submit packages via encrypted e-mail to cselboard@us.navy.mil.  Do not 
use the electronic submission of selection board documents to submit 
packages.  The full name of the candidate and full social security number 
(SSN) (full SSN marked on top right of each page) must be on all pages of the 
package.  The package requirements contained in reference (b), are modified 
as follows, and will only include:

Personnel File (for example, a missing evaluation or award, or documented 
completion of a degree).  Career summary letters are not authorized.

communication errors do not justify a late package.  Verify receipt of your
