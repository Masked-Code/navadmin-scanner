RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES REVISED SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS 
(SRB) AWARD LEVELS FOR ACTIVE COMPONENT AND RESERVE COMPONENT FULL  
TIME SUPPORT (FTS) AND SUPERSEDES REF A.  INCREASED AWARD LEVELS ARE 
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND DECREASES ARE EFFECTIVE 30 DAYS FROM RELEASE 
OF THIS MESSAGE.

2.  WHILE THE SRB PROGRAM CONTINUES TO BE THE NAVY'S PRIMARY MONETARY 
INCENTIVE TO ENCOURAGE SAILORS WITH CRITICAL SKILLS AND VALUABLE 
EXPERIENCE TO STAY NAVY, IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THE NAVY TO REMAIN WITHIN 
CONGRESSIONALLY AUTHORIZED FUNDING LIMITS.  ADDITIONALLY, SRB IS USED 
AS A FORCE SHAPING AND STABILIZATION TOOL TO HELP MINIMIZE OVER-
EXECUTION OR UNDER-EXECUTION OF CRITICAL SKILL RETENTION GOALS.  
THEREFORE, AS REENLISTMENT GOALS FOR PARTICULAR SKILLS ARE ACHIEVED, 
SRB AWARD LEVELS FOR THOSE SKILLS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE PLAN, BUT NO 
EARLIER THAN 30 DAYS FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF THIS NAVADMIN.  NAVADMINS 
WILL BE RELEASED AS SKILLS ARE REMOVED FROM THE PLAN; HOWEVER, THIS 
NAVADMIN CONSTITUTES THE 30-DAY NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT SET BY 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) POLICY FOR ANY SKILL SUBSEQUENTLY REMOVED 
FROM THE PROGRAM.  SAILORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SRB AS 
SOON AS ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN MET ACCORDING TO THIS 
NAVADMIN AND REFS B AND C.

3.  ALL SRB SKILLS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010 HAVE BEEN EVALUATED AND PLACED 
IN ONE OF THREE TIERS.  VARYING AWARD LEVELS AND EARLY REENLISTMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR EACH TIER.  SAILORS SERVING IN 
TIER ONE SKILLS, AS WELL AS THE EXCEPTIONS OUTLINED IN REF B, PARA 12.A 
AND REF C, PARA 4 ARE ELIGIBLE TO REENLIST EARLY ANY TIME WITHIN THE 
FISCAL YEAR OF THEIR EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE (EAOS).  
NUCLEAR SAILORS MAY STILL CROSS FISCAL YEAR BOUNDARIES.  SAILORS 
SERVING IN TIER TWO OR TIER THREE SKILLS WHO RECEIVED AN EARLY PROMOTE 
ON THEIR MOST RECENT REGULAR PERIODIC EVALUATION REPORT MAY ALSO 
REENLIST ANY TIME WITHIN THE FISCAL YEAR PRIOR TO THEIR EAOS (SEE PARA 
6 FOR MORE DETAILS AND GUIDELINES).  ALL OTHER SAILORS IN TIER TWO AND 
TIER THREE SKILLS MAY REENLIST UP TO 90 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THEIR EAOS 
AS DIRECTED IN REF C.  ALL SAILORS, REGARDLESS OF SKILL TIER MUST MEET 
ALL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA UNDER PARA 9 AND MUST SUBMIT PRECERTIFICATION 
REQUESTS TO NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (NAVPERSCOM (PERS-811)) NO LATER 
THAN 35 DAYS IN ADVANCE  OF THE REQUESTED REENLISTMENT DATE.

RECENT REGULAR PERIODIC EVALUATION OR FITNESS REPORT WILL BE ALLOWED TO 
REENLIST EARLY ANY TIME WITHIN THE FISCAL YEAR OF THEIR EAOS.  NO 
TRANSFER, CONCURRENT, OR SPECIAL EVALUATIONS WILL APPLY.  SAILORS 
ADVANCED WITHIN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THEIR EAOS, WILL BE ALLOWED TO 
SUBSTITUTE THE LAST REGULAR PERIODIC EVALUATION OR FITNESS REPORT IN 
THEIR PREVIOUS PAYGRADE.  PERSONNEL MUST FAX OR EMAIL A SIGNED COPY OF 
THE EVALUATION TO NAVPERSCOM (PERS-811) ONCE THEIR PRECERT HAS BEEN 
SUBMITTED.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS ONLY FOR THOSE THAT FALL UNDER THE 
PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH.
7.  THE FOLLOWING GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED ON NEC SPECIFIC SRB AND LATERAL 
CONVERSIONS.  ACCEPTANCE OF A NEC-SPECIFIC SRB CONTRACT INDICATES AN 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SAILOR AND THE NAVY TO UTILIZE SKILLS ATTRIBUTED 
TO THE NEC DURING THE SAILOR'S ENLISTMENT TO MEET FLEET READINESS 
REQUIREMENTS.  IN SUBSEQUENT TOURS, A SAILOR MUST BE WILLING TO BE 
DETAILED DURING THE NORMAL PROJECTED ROTATION DATE WINDOW TO AN 
AVAILABLE BILLET WITHIN THE SRB CONTRACTED NEC, CONSISTENT WITH SEA-
SHORE FLOW REQUIREMENTS.  LATERAL CONVERSIONS MUST FOLLOW REF B, PARA 
12.D.  LATERAL CONVERSION REQUESTS WILL NOT BE PROCESSED MORE THAN NINE 
MONTHS BEFORE THE EAOS.  CONVERSIONS TO A RATE WITH A LOWER AWARD LEVEL 
WILL NOT BE APPROVED.  PERSONNEL IN A "CLOSED-LOOP" NEC CAN REENLIST BY 
THE NEC ONLY.

8.  PERFORM-TO-SERVE (PTS) REQUIREMENTS.  THE SRB REQUEST FOR A SAILOR 
WHO REQUIRES PTS APPROVAL MUST BE SUBMITTED AFTER THE SAILOR HAS BEEN 
OFFICIALLY NOTIFIED OF PTS APPROVAL.  

9.  REENLISTMENT PROCEDURES.  SAILORS MAY REQUEST TO REENLIST EARLY FOR 
SRB SO LONG AS THEIR EAOS IS WITHIN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND IS NOT 
LATER THAN 90 DAYS FROM THE REQUESTED DATE OF REENLISTMENT.  
SEE PARA 6 OF THIS NAVADMIN; REF B, PARA 12.A; AND REF C, PARA 4 FOR 
EXCEPTIONS TO THIS POLICY.  OTHER POLICIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
PROCEDURES IN REFS A AND B AND THE DEFENSE JOINT MILITARY PAY SYSTEM
(DJMS) PROCEDURES TRAINING GUIDE REMAIN IN EFFECT.  

10.  OBLIGATED SERVICE TO TRAIN (OTT) AND THEN REENLIST.  SEE REF B, 
PARA 12.E. FOR OTT GUIDANCE.  REQUESTS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED TO 
NAVPERSCOM (PERS-811) VIA NAVPERS 1306/7, ENLISTED PERSONNEL ACTION 
REQUEST.  A COPY OF THE AUTHORIZATION MESSAGE SHOULD BE RETAINED BY THE 
SAILOR UNTIL THE SRB REENLISTMENT ON GRADUATION DAY FROM THE COURSE OF 
INSTRUCTION.  USE CODE 1CC (1RC FOR FTS) FOR OTT SRB REQUESTS IN OPINS.

11.  COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES.
    A.  COMMANDS MUST SUBMIT SRB REQUESTS VIA OPINS 35-120 DAYS IN 
ADVANCE OF THE SAILOR'S EAOS OR REENLISTMENT DATE TO ENSURE THE 
APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL MESSAGE WILL REACH THE SAILOR'S COMMAND AND THE 
DEFENSE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING SERVICE (DFAS) BEFORE THE REENLISTMENT 
DATE.  TIMELINESS IS CRITICAL AS THE APPROVED PRECERT NOTIFIES DJMS OF 
THE SAILOR'S INTENT TO REENLIST, PREVENTS INTERRUPTION OF PAY, AND 
ENSURES THE INITIAL SRB PAYMENT POSTS TO THE SAILOR'S ACCOUNT.  ANY 
CHANGES TO THE APPROVAL MAY CAUSE ERRORS AND SLOW PAYMENTS.  AS A 
RESULT, CHANGES SHOULD BE AVOIDED.  
REQUESTS SUBMITTED LESS THAN 35 DAYS PRIOR TO THE REENLISTMENT DATE 
WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL JUSTIFICATION WILL BE REJECTED.  SAILORS MUST HAVE 
APPROVED PRECERTS BEFORE REENLISTING.  THE SERVICING PERSONNEL OFFICE 
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING THE REENLISTMENT, POSTING THE CONTRACT, 
RELEASING THE FIRST PAYMENT, AND VERIFYING THE MASTER MILITARY PAY 
ACCOUNT.
    B.  COMMANDS INITIATING SRB PRECERT REQUESTS MUST ENSURE ALL DATA 
INCLUDED IN THE PRECERT REQUEST IS CORRECT AND THE SAILOR IS ELIGIBLE 
TO REENLIST FOR THE REQUESTED SRB.  THE SRB REQUEST SHALL NOT BE 
ENTERED INTO OPINS UNTIL THE COMMANDING OFFICER HAS APPROVED THE 
REENLISTMENT REQUEST.
    C.  SAILORS WITH APPROVED PRECERTS WHO DO NOT REENLIST ON THE DATE 
OR FOR THE TERM SPECIFIED IN THE PRECERT MESSAGE MUST HAVE THEIR 
COMMAND CONTACT NAVPERSCOM (PERS-811D) TO INITIATE A REENLISTMENT 
CANCELLATION TO AVOID PLACING SAILORS IN AN OVERPAID STATUS.
12.  INOPERATIVE EXTENSIONS POLICY.  IN KEEPING WITH DOD POLICY, 
PERSONNEL WHO ACCEPTED AN ENLISTMENT BONUS FOR EXTENDED ENLISTMENT 
(EBEE), AS REFLECTED ON THEIR NAVCRUIT 1133/52, WILL NO LONGER BE 
AUTHORIZED TO USE THIS INOPERATIVE EXTENSION TIME IN THE SRB 
CALCULATION.  SAILORS WHO HAVE INOPERATIVE EXTENSION TIME THROUGH A 5 
YEAR OLD OR 6 YEAR OLD PROGRAM, OR AS AUTHORIZED IN NAVADMIN 007/09, 
MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE A MAXIMUM OF 24 MONTHS OF INOPERATIVE EXTENSION 
TIME NOT COUNT AGAINST THE CALCULATION OF SRB PROVIDED THE REENLISTMENT 
RESULTS IN A NEW EAOS THAT IS AT LEAST 24 MONTHS DAY-FOR-DAY PAST THE 
CURRENT EXTENDED EAOS.  THIS CALCULATION IS PERFORMED AUTOMATICALLY BY 
NAVPERSCOM (PERS-811).  LOCAL COMMANDS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO CANCEL 
EXTENSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMMEDIATE SRB REENLISTMENTS.  COMMANDS 
MUST VERIFY AND ANNOTATE ON THE PRECERT REQUEST WHETHER ANY INOPERATIVE 
EXTENSION TIME NOTED IS PART OF AN ENLISTED BONUS FOR EXTENDED 
ENLISTMENT (EBEE) CONTRACT.

13.  PRECERT REQUIREMENTS.  THE FOLLOWING ARE REQUIRED WHEN SUBMITTING 
PRECERT REQUESTS:
    A.  TO VALIDATE AN INOPERATIVE EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT AND EXPEDITE 
PROCESSING OF AN SRB REQUEST, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN THE REMARKS 
PARAGRAPH OF THE REQUEST:  TERM, NARRATIVE REASON, AUTHORITY, AND 
EXECUTION DATE OF ALL INOPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  FAILURE TO VERIFY 
EXTENSIONS WILL CAUSE PROCESSING DELAYS AND MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF 
THE REQUEST OR AN APPROVAL AT A LOWER AMOUNT.
    B.  SAILORS MUST OBTAIN AN APPROVAL FOR EXTENSION FROM NAVPERSCOM 
(PERS-811) IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF SRB 
ELIGIBILITY.

14.  LITTORAL COMBAT SHIP (LCS) GUIDANCE.  SAILORS ASSIGNED TO LCS 
PLATFORMS OR WITH ORDERS TO AN LCS PLATFORM WHO POSSESS MULTIPLE NEC'S 
SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED FOR LCS ASSIGNMENT ARE AUTHORIZED TO REENLIST FOR 
THE MORE LUCRATIVE SRB-ELIGIBLE NEC, REGARDLESS OF ASSIGNED RATING.

15.  TO ENSURE THAT ALL REQUIREMENTS AND TIMELINES ARE MET, VISIT THE 
FOLLOWING SRB PAGE OF THE NPC WEBSITE: 
WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/CAREERINFO/PAYANDBENEFITS/N130/N130D

16.  POINT OF CONTACT FOR A SAILOR WHO HAS REENLISTED AND HAS NOT 
RECEIVED THEIR SRB PAYMENT, OR HAS QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE TAXATION OF 
THEIR SRB AND ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS, IS THE SAILOR'S SERVICING PAY OFFICE 
OR PERSONNEL SUPPORT DETACHMENT.  SRB TAX INFORMATION IS ALSO DISCUSSED 
IN DOD FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REGULATION VOL 7A, CH 44, TABLE 44-1, RULE 
7.  THE POINT OF CONTACT FOR A SAILOR WITH QUESTIONS REGARDING THE SRB 
PROGRAM OR ANY INFORMATION ON THEIR BUPERS-ON-LINE ACCOUNT IS THEIR 
COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR (CCC).  FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS OR 
CLARIFICATIONS, CCCS, NOT THE INDIVIDUAL SAILORS, ARE ENCOURAGED TO 
CONTACT NAVPERSCOM (PERS-811D) AT (901) 874-2526/DSN 882, FAX (901) 
874-2623/DSN 882 OR E-MAIL EMCM(SS) IRISH AT 
DOUGLAS.B.IRISH(AT)NAVY.MIL OR MR. FRANK PALOMO AT 
FRANCISCO.PALOMO(AT)NAVY.MIL. 

17.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS RETENTION BEHAVIOR AND ADJUST SRB AWARD 
LEVELS ACCORDINGLY.
