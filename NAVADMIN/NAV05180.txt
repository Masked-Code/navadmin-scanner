SUBJ/PHYSICAL READINESS PROGRAM//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  TO ENSURE OUR PHYSICAL READINESS PROGRAM TRULY
SUPPORTS OUR SAILORS AND COMMANDS IN MAINTAINING A FIT, FULLY
CAPABLE AND MISSION READY FORCE; AN EXHAUSTIVE REVIEW OF THE NAVY'S
PHYSICAL READINESS PROGRAM IS IN PROGRESS.  EXTENSIVE FLEET INPUT
HAS MADE IT CLEAR THE NAVY MUST ADAPT OUR PHYSICAL READINESS POLICY
TO REFLECT THE FLEXIBILITY AND AGILITY OUR MISSION ENVIRONMENT
REQUIRES.  A FIT FORCE INCREASES THE WELLNESS AND PRODUCTIVITY OF
OUR PERSONNEL AND DECREASES LOST MAN-HOURS OVER TIME.  WE MUST
THEREFORE RECOGNIZE THAT PHYSICAL FITNESS IS A READINESS ISSUE BEST
ADDRESSED BY CREATING A CULTURE THAT PROMOTES HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AND
PROVIDES SAILORS THE LEADERSHIP, TOOLS, AND TIME TO ACHIEVE AND
MAINTAIN FITNESS GOALS.
2.  REVISION OF THE PROGRAM WILL OCCUR IN THREE PHASES:
REESTABLISHING COMMAND AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY, PROGRAM
EXECUTION IMPROVEMENT, AND ULTIMATELY, CREATING A CULTURE OF
FITNESS.  WE ARE HOLDING INDIVIDUALS, AS WELL AS COMMANDING
OFFICERS, ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAINTAINING A FIT LIFESTYLE.  COMMANDERS
WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY IN HANDLING SAILORS WHO HAVE FAILED
TO MEET STANDARDS AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL TOOLS AND INCENTIVES FOR
SAILORS WHO NEED HELP.  THE GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH A POSITIVE CULTURE
OF FITNESS IN WHICH EXERCISE DURING THE WORKDAY, PURSUIT OF
HEALTHIER LIFESTYLES, AND INCREASED OVERALL WELLNESS IS THE STANDARD
FOR OUR SAILORS.  THESE POLICY CHANGES ARE ABOUT PROMOTING FITNESS
AND INSTILLING THAT INTO OUR NAVY.  EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, THE BELOW
LISTED ACTIONS ARE IN EFFECT.
3.  LEADERSHIP (IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR IN COMMAND (ISIC)):  EMPHASIZE
THAT PHYSICAL READINESS IS BOTH A LEADERSHIP AND INDIVIDUAL
RESPONSIBILITY.  STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF PHYSICAL FITNESS, THE
PHYSICAL READINESS PROGRAM, AND ENCOURAGE PERSONNEL TO PURSUE FIT
LIFESTYLES.  PROVIDE TIME FOR PHYSICAL TRAINING DURING THE WORK WEEK
AND EVALUATE THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH TESTING AND
REPORTING, FITNESS ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM (FEP), AND OTHER ASPECTS OF
THE PROGRAM.  TREAT PHYSICAL READINESS AS YOU WOULD RETENTION/
ATTRITION IN FUTURE FITNESS REPORTS ON YOUR SUBORDINATE OFFICER AND
SENIOR ENLISTED LEADERS.
4.  COMMAND ACCOUNTABILITY:  CO/OICS ARE REMINDED THAT THEIR COMMAND
WILL HAVE AN EFFECTIVE FEP IN PLACE FOR THOSE SAILORS WHO ARE NOT,
OR ARE ONLY MARGINALLY WITHIN STANDARDS.  SAILORS IN THE FEP WILL
BE DOCUMENTED TO INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, A RECORD OF THE
SAILOR'S PHYSICAL FITNESS ASSESSMENT (PFA) DEFICIENCY AND A DETAILED
PLAN ON HOW THE COMMAND AND MEMBER WILL OVERCOME THIS DEFICIENCY.  A
LOG OF THE SAILOR'S PROGRESS WILL BE KEPT AND AT A MINIMUM WILL
INCLUDE THE FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, TIME, AND TYPE (FITT PRINCIPLE) OF
PHYSICAL TRAINING (PT) SESSIONS HE/SHE ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN, AND
MONTHLY PFA RESULTS AS RECORDED IN PRIMS.  FEP SHALL BE CONDUCTED
DURING THE WORKDAY AT LEAST THREE TIMES WEEKLY FOR ONE HOUR PER
SESSION.  FOR BODY COMPOSITION ASSESSMENT (BCA) FAILURES, COMMANDS
ARE DIRECTED TO CONCENTRATE ON DECREASING BODY FAT.  MINIMUM
ACCEPTABLE FITNESS PROGRESSION FOR SAILORS WHO FAILED THE BCA IS A
ONE PERCENT DECREASE IN BODY FAT PER MONTH, BUT NO GREATER THAN A
FIVE PERCENT LOSS OF BODY WEIGHT IN ANY WEEK.
5.  SAILORS WHO DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN STANDARDS WILL BE
PROCESSED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SEPARATION (ADSEP) PER MILPERSMAN
ARTICLE 1910-170 UTILIZING THE FOLLOWING PHASED APPROACH:
    A.  JULY 2005:  CO/OICS AUTHORIZED, WITH ISIC CONCURRENCE, TO
INITIATE ADSEP PROCESSING OF PERSONNEL WHO FAILED THE PFA THREE OR
MORE TIMES IN THE MOST RECENT FOUR YEARS AND IN THEIR JUDGEMENT ARE
NOT TRYING, OR INDICATE THEY ARE UNWILLING TO TRY, TO MEET STANDARDS.
    B.  JANUARY 2006:  CO/OICS SHALL REVIEW PERSONNEL WHO FAILED
THE PFA THREE OR MORE TIMES IN THE MOST RECENT FOUR YEARS AND ALSO
FAILED THE FALL 2005 PFA.  CO/OICS ARE AUTHORIZED WITH ISIC
CONCURRENCE TO INITIATE ADSEP PROCESSING FOR THOSE SAILORS WHO ARE
NOT MAKING REASONABLE PROGRESS TOWARD MEETING STANDARDS.
    C.  JULY 2006:  MANDATORY ADSEP PROCESSING FOR PERSONNEL WHO
FAILED THE PFA THREE OR MORE TIMES IN THE MOST RECENT FOUR YEARS AND
FAILED THE SPRING 2006 PFA.  CO/OICS MAY REQUEST THE ISIC WAIVE
ADSEP PROCESSING FOR SPECIAL CASES.  PERSONNEL WHO FAILED THE PFA
THREE OR MORE TIMES IN THE MOST RECENT FOUR YEARS BUT PASSED THE
SPRING 2006 PFA MUST CONTINUE PASSING THE PFA DURING EACH SUBSEQUENT
CYCLE UNTIL NO LONGER POSSESSING THREE FAILURES IN A FOUR-YEAR
PERIOD.
6.  PROMOTION AND ADVANCEMENT:  OFFICERS AND ENLISTED MEMBERS WILL
BE INELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION, ADVANCEMENT, OR FROCKING IF THEY FAILED
THE MOST RECENT OFFICIAL PFA.  MEMBERS MAY REGAIN ELIGIBILITY BY
PASSING A MONTHLY PRACTICE FEP PFA.  IF THE MEMBER IS NOT WITHIN
STANDARDS BY THE PROMOTION CYCLE LIMITING DATE, THE ADVANCEMENT
AUTHORITY WILL BE WITHDRAWN PER BUPERSINST 1430.16E (FOR ENLISTED
PERSONNEL) OR DELAYED PROMOTION OR REMOVAL FROM THE PROMOTION LIST
(FOR OFFICERS) PER SECNAVINST 1420.1A.
7.  PFA RETAKE:  PERSONNEL THAT FAIL THE PFA, MAY RETEST AND RECORD
THE BEST SCORE ACHIEVED WITHIN THE COMMAND'S OFFICIAL PFA CYCLE.
8.  BODY COMPOSITION ASSESSMENT (BCA) EXCEPTION:  FOR PERSONNEL WHO
SCORE AN OVERALL OUTSTANDING OR EXCELLENT, WITHOUT A SINGLE EVENT ON
THE PHYSICAL READINESS TEST SCORED BELOW "GOOD", CO/OICS ARE
AUTHORIZED TO INCREASE NAVY BCA CRITERIA TO THE DOD MAXIMUM STANDARD
OF 26 PERCENT FOR MALES AND 36 PERCENT FOR FEMALES.  THE INDIVIDUAL
MUST PRESENT A PROFESSIONAL MILITARY APPEARANCE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR
CONSIDERATION.
9.  THE NEXT PHASE IS TO ENACT PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS TO REFLECT THE
TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY NAVY IN WHICH WE SERVE.  THE NEW PROGRAM WILL
NOT ONLY ENCOURAGE POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL CHANGES, BUT MAY INCLUDE NEW
TESTING OPTIONS AND INCENTIVES, AND WILL ALSO PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY
AND REWARDS FOR COMMANDERS.  THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO TRANSITION FROM
OUR CURRENT CULTURE OF TESTING TO A CULTURE OF FITNESS.  SOME OF THE
CHANGES AND RATIONALE THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING ARE:
    A.  ADDING THE ELLIPTICAL AND STATIONARY CYCLE AS OPTIONS FOR
THE AEROBIC PORTION OF THE TEST.
    B.  SIMPLIFYING THE CURRENT PRT SCORING CATEGORIES TO SUPERIOR,
AVERAGE, AND MARGINAL AND TO REFLECT THOSE CATEGORIES IN BLOCK 20 ON
THE FITREP/EVAL.  FOR THOSE SAILORS WHO SCORE A SUPERIOR ON THE PFA,
THE NEXT PFA COULD BE WAIVED AT THE CO S DISCRETION.  SAILORS WHO
FAIL OR SCORE MARGINAL WOULD BE PLACED IN THE FITNESS ENHANCEMENT
PROGRAM.
    C.  ADDING BODY FAT MEASUREMENTS FOR ALL SAILORS TO HEIGHT,
WEIGHT, BLOOD PRESSURE AND CHOLESTEROL DATA COLLECTED DURING THE
ANNUAL HEALTH EXAMINATION TO AID THE NAVY, AS WELL AS THE SAILOR, IN
JUDGING OVERALL FITNESS AND HEALTH.
    D.  INCORPORATING A STANDARDIZED PT UNIFORM THAT WILL BE WORN
DURING PFAS AND COMMAND GROUP PT.
    E.  IMPROVING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDE
THE NECCESSARRY TOOLS TO ALLOW ISIC VISIBILITY OVER SUBORDINATE
COMMAND FITNESS SCORES AND PROGRAM TO COMPARE THIER SUBORDINATE
UNITS.
10.  THE APPROVED CHANGES OUTLINED IN THIS NAVADMIN AND OTHERS ARE
REFLECTED IN OPNAVINST 6110.1H WHICH WILL SOON BE AVAILABLE AT:
WWW:/NEDS.DAPS.DLA.MIL/6110.HTM. THE NAVY PHYSICAL READINESS PROGRAM
(COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-676) WEBSITE AT
WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/COMMANDSUPPORT/PHYSICALREADINESS WILL ALSO CONTAIN
THIS DIRECTIVE AND OTHER FITNESS, NUTRITION, AND WEIGHT MANAGEMENT
REFERENCES.
11.  TO ACHIEVE BOTH THE CURRENT REVISIONS AND THOSE TO FOLLOW,
COMMAND SUPPORT IS PARAMOUNT.  IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
LEADERSHIP TO ESTABLISH A COVENANT WITH SAILORS TO PROMOTE FITNESS
BY PROVIDING THE TOOLS FOR SUCCESS TO OUR SAILORS, ESPECIALLY THOSE
WHO HAVE FAILED, TO HELP THEM SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE FEP AND
SUBSEQUENTLY PASS THE PFA.
12.  AS WITH ANY CHANGE, THERE WILL BE CHALLENGES.  THE CURRENT
CHANGES ARE THE FIRST STEP IN THE PROCESS TO ESTABLISHING A CULTURE
OF FITNESS.  COMMANDERS WILL BE CHALLENGED TO FOSTER A POSITIVE
FITNESS CULTURE AND SAILORS WILL BE CHALLENGED TO LIVE THIS CULTURE
AND HOLD THEIR FELLOW SHIPMATES TO THE STANDARD.  THIS WILL BE A
JOURNEY LONG OVERDUE.  WITH YOUR HELP, WE WILL GET THERE.
