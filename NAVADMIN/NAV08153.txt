REF/C/DOC/CNPC/23AUG2005// REF/D/DOC/CNPC/24JUN2003// NARR/REF A IS

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN IS TO ANNOUNCE THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE ENLISTED 
NAVAL AIRCREW (NAC) RATING WHICH BEGAN IN FY05 WITH THE HELICOPTER NAC 
RATING ANNOUNCED IN REF A.  TO COMPLETE THE PHASED APPROACH OF THE NAC 
RATING CONSOLIDATION, THE CNO HAS APPROVED THE CONSOLIDATION OF ALL 
REMAINING SOURCE RATED NAVAL AIRCREWMEN INTO A SINGLE SOURCE RATING 
WITH FIVE NEW SERVICE RATINGS (AWR, AWS, AWO, AWF, AWV) AND CHANGE OF 
THE NAME OF THE AW RATING FROM AVIATION WARFARE SYSTEMS OPERATOR (AW) 
TO NAVAL AIRCREWMEN (AW).  THIS MERGER WILL APPLY TO ACTIVE COMPONENT, 
FULL TIME SUPPORT (FTS), SELECTED RESERVE (SELRES) AND INDIVIDUAL READY 
RESERVE (IRR) SOURCE RATED NAVAL AIRCREWMEN.  FURTHER, THIS NAVADMIN 
ALSO CONSOLIDATES THE FTS ACOUSTIC AND NON-ACOUSTIC FIXED-WING AW'S 
(AWO) AND IN-FLIGHT TECHNICIANS (AWV) INTO THE ACTIVE COMPONENT 
DETAILED IN PARAS 10 THROUGH 18 BELOW.  
2.  THIS CONSOLIDATION MARKS A MAJOR MILESTONE IN THE EVOLUTION OF 
NAVAL AVIATION AND AIRCREW CULTURE.  ESTABLISHING A SINGLE AIRCREW 
GENERAL RATING WILL ELIMINATE INEFFICIENCIES IN THE TRAINING PIPELINE, 
IMPROVE ADVANCEMENT QUALITY, PROVIDE MORE CONTROL OF THE NAC ENLISTED 
FORCE AND IMPROVE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND CAREER MANAGEMENT.
3.  OFFICIAL CONVERSION TO AW WILL OCCUR ON 1 OCT 2008 FOR ALL ACTIVE 
COMPONENT E1-E9, FTS E1-E9, AND SELRES AND IRR E6-E9. FOR SELRES AND 
IRR E1-E5, CONVERSION WILL TAKE EFFECT ON 1 APR 2009.  REQUIRED 
INDIVIDUAL PERSONNEL ACTION AND COMMAND ACTION IS DETAILED IN PARAS 7 
AND 8 BELOW.
4.  THE AW RATING BADGE WILL BE UTILIZED FOR THE NEW COMBINED RATING.  
ALL AW PERSONNEL E1-E9 MAY CONTINUE WEARING THEIR SOURCE RATING BADGE 
UNTIL THEIR NEXT ADVANCEMENT OR TWO YEARS FROM THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF 
CONVERSION.  THE ENLISTED MASTER FILE WILL REFLECT ALL ACTIVE COMPONENT 
AND FTS AFFECTED BY THIS RATING CONSOLIDATION AS PERSONNEL IN THE AW 
RATING EFFECTIVE 1 OCT 2008.  INACTIVE MANPOWER AND PERSONNEL 
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (IMAPMIS) WILL REFLECT ALL SELRES/IRR E6-
E9 EFFECTIVE 1 OCT 2008 AND SELRES/IRR E1-E5 EFFECTIVE
1 APR 2009.
