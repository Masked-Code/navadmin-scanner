SUBJ/NAVY AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE COMMAND//

RMKS/1.  INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE (IAMD) IS A CORE MISSION OF 
THE UNITED STATES NAVY AND A KEY ENABLING CAPABILITY THAT WE PROVIDE 
THE JOINT FORCE.  WITH THE PROLIFERATION OF THREATS AROUND THE GLOBE, 
OUR FLEET REMAINS IN GREATER DEMAND AND MORE RELEVANT THAN EVER.  
FORWARD DEPLOYED, OUR FLEET IS PROVIDING ASSURED ACCESS, CREDIBLE 
DETERRENCE AND IS WELL-POSTURED TO DEFEND OUR HOMELAND, REGIONAL ALLIES, 
AND OUR SEA BASE.

2.  TO REMAIN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS IMPORTANT MISSION AREA, I 
DIRECTED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NAVY AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE COMMAND 
(NAMDC), WHICH SERVES AS THE NAVY'S LEAD ORGANIZATION FOR NAVAL, JOINT, 
AND COMBINED IAMD MATTERS.  NAMDC BRINGS TOGETHER THE TECHNOLOGY, 
CONCEPTS, PROGRAMS, AND INTELLECTUAL EFFORTS FOR OUR AIR AND BALLISTIC 
MISSILE DEFENSE (BMD) INITIATIVES, AND WILL PROVIDE IAMD OPERATIONAL 
MISSION SUPPORT TO THE FLEET.

3.  NAMDC WILL FOCUS ON SEVEN FUNCTIONAL AREAS WITH AN INCREMENTAL 
PHASE-IN APPROACH. THESE AREAS INCLUDE:
A.  ASSESSING MARITIME BMD AT THE FLEET, STRIKE GROUP, AND UNIT LEVEL.
SUPPORTING EXISTING ORGANIZATIONS TASKED WITH ASSESSMENT AND 
CERTIFICATION FUNCTIONS, NAMDC WILL DEVELOP STANDARD IAMD READINESS 
CRITERIA TO FACILITATE OPERATIONAL, CROSS-PLATFORM MISSION AREA 
ASSESSMENT.
B.  FOSTERING HIGH PERFORMANCE IN IAMD OPERATIONS AT ALL ECHELONS BY 
ADVISING THE FLEET AND TRAINING AUTHORITIES ON THE UNIFORM BEST 
PRACTICES IN TRAINING.
C.  PROVIDING DELIBERATE AND CRISIS MISSION SUPPORT TO OPERATIONAL 
COMMANDERS AND FORCES.
D.  PROMOTING RAPID DELIVERY OF SELECTED NEW IAMD TECHNOLOGIES.
E.  SUPPORTING FLEETS, RESOURCE SPONSORS, AND SYSTEM COMMANDS WITH THE 
DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF IAMD REQUIREMENTS FOR JOINT AND NAVY 
PROCESSES.
F.  LEADING NAVY IAMD CONCEPT, DOCTRINE AND TACTICS DEVELOPMENT, AND 
EXPERIMENTATION.
G.  ADVOCATING NAVY POSITIONS AND CAPABILITIES IN JOINT IAMD FORUMS.

4.  NAMDC WILL FACILITATE INTEGRATION OF NAVY IAMD CAPABILITIES INTO 
THE JOINT FORCE; ENHANCE NAVY'S CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT 
OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR JOINT PLANNING AND EXECUTION; PROVIDE 
MECHANISMS FOR HOLISTIC ASSESSMENT OF OUR PROGRESS IN THIS COMPLEX 
MISSION AREA; AND PROVIDE OUR LEADERSHIP WITH FEEDBACK ON GAPS/SEAMS TO 
ENSURE OUR NAVY IS EMPOWERED WITH THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, 
PROCESSES, AND SYSTEMS TO CONSISTENTLY PLAN AND EXECUTE OPERATIONS.

5.  NAMDC WAS ESTABLISHED AT NAVAL SUPPORT FACILITY DAHLGREN, VIRGINIA 
AND IS COMMANDED BY RADM BRAD HICKS, WHO WILL REPORT TO COMMANDER, 
THIRD FLEET (C3F) AS AN ECHELON IV COMMANDER.
WARFARE
CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE, RESOURCE SPONSORS, PROGRAM MANAGERS, LABS, 
TRAINING ORGANIZATIONS, AND OPERATIONAL AND TACTICAL DEVELOPMENT 
COMMANDS WILL COLLABORATE WITH NAMDC TO COLLECTIVELY IMPROVE OUR IAMD 
CAPABILITIES.

6.  ASSURED ACCESS TO THE MARITIME DOMAIN UNDERPINS OUR MARITIME 
STRATEGY.  AS WE ADAPT TO INCREASINGLY LETHAL AND COMPLEX THREATS, WE 
MUST FOCUS OUR RESOURCES AND EFFORTS TO MAXIMUM EFFECT.
NAMDC IS THE SINGLE NAVY VOICE TO SYNCHRONIZE AND INTEGRATE OUR EFFORTS 
ACROSS THE FULL SPECTRUM OF AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE.

7.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
