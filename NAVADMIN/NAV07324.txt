2.  AS ALWAYS, COMPETITION FOR REDESIGNATION WAS KEEN, AND EVERY 
COMMUNITY HAD A POOL OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES TO SELECT FROM. 
ELIGIBLE OFFICERS NOT INITIALLY SELECTED FOR THEIR PRIMARY OR SECONDARY 
CHOICE WERE SUBSEQUENTLY REVIEWED BY ALL OTHER COMMUNITIES FOR 
CONSIDERATION.  THOSE OFFICERS TENTATIVELY SELECTED FOR COMMUNITIES NOT 
INITIALLY REQUESTED WILL BE NOTIFIED VIA OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE AND 
OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDESIGNATE. 
3.  THE BOARD NOTED THE FOLLOWING LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE 
DELIBERATIONS OF THE NOVEMBER 2007 TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION BOARDS:
    A.  PERFORMANCE, PERFORMANCE, PERFORMANCE.  STRONG PERFORMANCE AND 
RELEVANT EXPERIENCE WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR SELECTION.
    B.  INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION (IA) EXPERIENCE WAS AN IMPORTANT 
CONSIDERATION IN DETERMINING THE OVERALL STRENGTH OF THE MEMBER?S 
RECORD.
    C.  FIRST ENDORSEMENTS FROM THE APPLICANTS CURRENT REPORTING SENIOR 
WERE HELPFUL.  PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WERE COMMENTS REGARDING AN 
OFFICER?S FUTURE POTENTIAL IN THE SPECIFIC COMMUNITY REQUESTED.
    D.  SEEK SPONSORSHIP.  GAINING COMMUNITY ENDORSEMENT AND EVIDENCE 
OF A CANDIDATE?S PROACTIVE EFFORT IN SEEKING GAINING COMMUNITY 
MENTORSHIP WERE CONSIDERED HIGHLY FAVORABLE ELEMENTS IN MAKING A RECORD 
MORE COMPETITIVE AND SOMETIMES ACTED TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN TWO 
OTHERWISE IDENTICAL RECORDS.
    E.  COMMUNICATE YOUR SELECTABILITY.  FAMILIARITY WITH THE COMMUNITY 
YOU DESIRE TO REDESIGNATE INTO SHOULD ASSIST YOUR PREPARATION IN 
DEVELOPING A LOGICAL, RELEVANT RECORD FOR BOARD EVALUATION.  BEYOND THE 
MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS, YOUR PACKAGE SHOULD EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE 
EXPERIENCE, SKILLS, EDUCATION, AND SENIOR SPONSORSHIP.  HAVING A MEMBER 
OF YOUR GAINING COMMUNITY REVIEW YOUR PACKAGE WOULD BE HIGHLY 
BENEFICIAL.  ADDITIONALLY, RELEVANT EDUCATION COURSES, CERTIFICATIONS, 
AND COMMUNITY RELATED EXPERIENCE WERE VIEWED EXTREMELY FAVORABLY IN 
DETERMINING THE OVERALL STRENGTH OF APPLICANTS? RECORDS.
    F.  KEEP TRYING.  REDESIGNATION OPPORTUNITY IS DRIVEN BY QUOTAS 
THAT CAN CHANGE FROM BOARD TO BOARD, FOR BOTH THE GAINING AND LOSING 
COMMUNITIES.  IF YOU ARE NOT SELECTED, RE-APPLY AND KEEP WORKING TO 
IMPROVE YOUR RECORD IN THOSE SKILLS RELEVANT TO YOUR DESIRED 
REDESIGNATION COMMUNITY.  ALSO, REVIEW THE BOARD PRECEPT TO DETERMINE 
IF NON-SELECTION WAS DUE TO YEAR GROUP QUOTA RESTRICTIONS.  REFER TO 
THE SELECTION BOARD WEBSITE AT WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/BOARDS/ 
ADMINISTRATIVE/ACTIVEDUTYTRANSFERREDSIGNATION/ (CLICK ON BOARD PRECEPT).
4.  THIS MSG IS NOT AUTHORITY TO DELIVER CHANGE OF DESIGNATOR LETTER TO 
THE SELECTEE.
    A.  OFFICERS WHO ARE PROMOTION SELECTEES SHOULD CONTACT THEIR 
CURRENT DETAILER TO DISCUSS REDESIGNATION TIMING.  COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS- 
802), UPON NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) THAT THE SELECTEE HAS 
BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO THEIR NEW COMMUNITY, WILL FORWARD A 
REDESIGNATION LETTER TO THE SELECTEE OR APPOINTMENT ACCEPTANCE AND OATH 
OF OFFICE (NAVPERS 1000/4), AS APPLICABLE.
    B.  OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT PROMOTION SELECTEES AND WHO ARE NOT UNDER 
ORDERS CAN EXPECT ASSIGNMENT TO A BILLET APPROPRIATE TO THEIR NEW 
DESIGNATION WHEN NOTIFIED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4).
    C.  IF A MEMBER IS CURRENTLY UNDER ORDERS AND TRANSFERS PRIOR TO 
NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4), MEMBER MUST EXECUTE ORDERS 
UNDER CURRENT DESIGNATOR AND MUST COMPLETE 12 MONTHS AT THE NEW 
ASSIGNMENT, UNLESS A SHORTER TOUR IS PRESCRIBED (TOURS IN EXCESS OF ONE 
YEAR WILL BE WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE GAINING COMMUNITY), PRIOR TO 
REDESIGNATION.
5.  THE FOLLOWING ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE ABOVE:
    A.  SURFACE WARFARE (11XX) OFFICERS WHO ARE UNDER ORDERS TO 
DEPARTMENT HEAD SCHOOL MAY NOT LATERALLY TRANSFER UNTIL COMPLETION OF 
INITIAL DEPARTMENT HEAD TOUR.  ADDITIONALLY, THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS ARE 
NOT ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR LATERAL TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION UNTIL WITHIN
1 YEAR OF SATISFYING THEIR RESPECTIVE OBLIGATION:
        -  OFFICERS WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR SURFACE WARFARE OFFICER 
CONTINUATION PAY (SWOCP).
        -  OFFICERS WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR JUNIOR SURFACE WARFARE OFFICER 
CRITICAL SKILLS BONUS (JR SWO CSRB).
        -  OFFICERS OBLIGATED TO COMPLETE DEPARTMENT HEAD ASSIGNMENTS 
DUE TO SELECTION FOR DIVISION OFFICER SEQUENCE PLAN-B OR A SWOCP 
OBLIGATED SHORE TOUR.
        -  OFFICERS WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR A SURFACE WARFARE OFFICER 
CRITICAL SKILLS (SWOCS) BONUS.
    B.  AVIATION OFFICERS SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED TO LATERAL TRANSFER 
UNTIL COMPLETION OF ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE OBLIGATION, EXPIRATION OF 
AVIATION CAREER CONTINUATION PAY CONTRACT, OR PLANNED ROTATION DATE, 
WHICHEVER IS LATER.
    C.  ANY APPLICANT FOR 1510 WHO IS PRESENTLY DESIGNATED 131X OR 132X 
AND IS ELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION BEFORE THE BOARD MAY BE REDESIGNATED 
1510 IN ACCORDANCE WITH MILPERSMAN 1212-010, IF SELECTED.  HOWEVER, IF 
A SECOND SEA TOUR OR AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD TOUR HAS NOT BEEN 
COMPLETED, ASSIGNMENT TO 1510 BILLETS MAY BE DELAYED UNTIL THE 
COMPLETION OF APPLICABLE SECOND SEA AND/OR AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD 
TOUR, AS DETERMINED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-43).
6.  COMMANDING OFFICERS SHALL:
    A.  ENSURE OFFICERS SELECTED FOR PROMOTION WITHIN THEIR CURRENT 
COMMUNITY DO NOT ACCEPT REDESIGNATION BEFORE THEIR PROMOTION DATE.
    B.  NOTIFY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-803) WITHIN 30 DAYS OF RELEASE OF 
THIS MESSAGE OF SELECTEES WHO DO NOT DESIRE TO ACCEPT TRANSFER/ 
REDESIGNATION.
7.  THE NEXT LATERAL TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION SELECTION BOARD WILL BE 
HELD 2 JUN 08.  APPLICATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 11 APR 08.  NON- 
SELECTEES FROM PAST BOARDS MUST SUBMIT A NEW APPLICATION FOR 
CONSIDERATION.  OPNAVINST 1210.5 AND MILPERSMAN ARTICLES 1212-010 AND 
1212-030 SHOULD BE REVIEWED FOR ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND 
APPLICATION PROCEDURES. OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS AND MOST RECENT FITREP ARE 
REQUIRED AS PART OF APPLICATION PACKAGES.
