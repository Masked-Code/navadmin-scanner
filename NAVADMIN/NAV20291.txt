RMKS/1.  To improve Fleet readiness and warfighting effectiveness through
repurposed Sailor and command leadership focus and time, the MyNavy HR team
continues to make progress in fielding a modern Human Resources (HR)
services delivery capability to improve all HR functions  especially more 
timely and accurate personnel and pay transactions.  This NAVADMIN announces 
the rollout of three new capabilities to the Navy Personnel and Pay (NP2) 
system:
improved travel processing capabilities, Reserve Orders and MySailor Data.
NP2 is the modern integrated personnel and pay system that is already
Proving a key enabler to successful MyNavy HR Transformation.  References (b)
Through (d) announced the initial rollout of NP2 in 2019 with the launch of 
MyPCS Mobile, providing Active Duty Sailors with CAC-free mobile access to a
tailored Permanent Change of Station (PCS) checklist, viewable orders in an
easier to read format, an automated wizard driven electronic travel voucher
capability and a travel entitlements calculator.
2.  Similar to the previously deployed NP2 capabilities, Sailor access to
New NP2 capabilities will be available 24/7 and from any mobile device 
through MyNavy Portal at https://my.navy.mil.  CAC-free entry to NP2 is 
enabled by registering on MyNavy Portal.  Sailors may also continue to use 
the conventional CAC sign-in from a CAC-enabled device.
3.  Improved Travel Processing Capabilities.  Sailors who use the new PCS
Travel Voucher Wizard capability will experience a more efficient process
than todays paper-based capability.  The voucher will be pre-filled with
information from the Sailors orders and personnel record, and Sailors can
complete their PCS travel claim form (DD Form 1351-2) in the Travel Voucher
Wizard.  Sailor travel vouchers approved in NP2 for processing by Command
Pay and Personnel Administrators (CPPA) will be sent to voucher processing
Clerks to begin pay processing.  All required approval signatures will be 
completed with e-signature capability.  Automation of this process eliminates 
the need for CPPAs to manually download and retransmit travel vouchers and 
associated supporting documents and the need for hard copies of travel 
claims.  This capability applies to all Active Duty and Full Time Support 
Sailors traveling on PCS orders as well as Reservists executing Active Duty 
for Operational Support (ADOS) and Officer Recall PCS orders.
4.  Reserve Orders.  This upgrade will integrate the following Reserve order
types into NP2:  Mobilization and Demobilization, ADOS and Officer Recall.
Reserve Sailors will have the same capability as Active Duty Sailors to
execute a tailored checklist for use in move preparation and can view and
print an abbreviated orders format called lean orders.  This feature
includes a command view function that allows review of checklist completion 
status to determine Sailor readiness and preparedness, as well as the ability 
for Sailors to opt-in and immediately get on the waitlist for government 
housing and childcare services at their new duty station.  Sailors can 
generate their checklist online at any time and tasks are listed 
chronologically to improve the overall move experience for Sailors and their 
dependents.
Note:  Only Reservists with ADOS or Officer Recall PCS orders will have the
ability to use the Travel Voucher Wizard capability in the current release.
5.  MySailor Data.  This capability establishes an on-line display of the HR
data NP2 needs to support personnel and pay transactions for Active Duty and
Reserve Sailors, to include assignment, service data and biographical
information.  In the future, MySailor Data will replace the Navy Standard
Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) Electronic Service Record (ESR).  The
initial MySailor Data release will contain a subset of HR data required for
Assignments, Leave and Travel capabilities to include Reserve orders.  This
capability will be accessible on personal and government mobile devices,
tablets, laptops and desktops.  This release will provide Sailors "view
only" capability for data across both Active Duty and Reserve components.
MySailor Data will be used to determine Sailor pay.  Therefore, it is 
imperative that Sailors review their MySailor Data early to identify any data 
errors upfront to avoid potential future pay issues.  The technical 
capability to update MySailor Data will be coming in a future release.  
Please continue to coordinate with your CPPA, MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) or 
Naval Reserve Activity/Naval Operational Support Center for all data 
correction requests.
As new NP2 capabilities are released, MySailor Data will expand, ultimately
providing a comprehensive display of data supporting the Sailor career
continuum from accession to retirement.
6.  These NP2 capability enhancements are just the latest steps towards
fielding a modernized Personnel and Pay process that makes the overall
customer experience better for Sailors and their families.  We will deploy
new capabilities to Sailors and the Navy HR workforce quarterly.
7.  Contact the MNCC with any questions, issues or to provide feedback at
833-330-MNCC/6622 or via e-mail at askMNCC(at)navy.mil.
