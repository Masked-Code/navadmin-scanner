    b.  Forward NCR reportable DVI data to Director, 21st Century Office 
(OPNAV (N17)) quarterly (15 January, 15 April, 15 July, 15 October) and final 
report no later than 30 November.  At a minimum, data will include: 

        (1) Command Name
        (2) Command Primary Unit Identification Code (UIC)
        (3) Incident Report Date
        (4) Category of Abuse/Severity
        (5) Name of Service Member Offender

3.  Echelon II responsibilities.  Echelon II commanders will establish Family 
Advocacy Liaisons throughout their enterprises to facilitate timely reporting 
of DVIC-CCA reports and also follow-up on missing reports if required.

4.  Commanders responsibilities
    a.  Report completed command actions for incidents that were determined 
by Family Advocacy Program (FAP) to meet the incident severity scale criteria 
by fiscal year via encrypted e-mail to DVIC_CCA(at)navy.mil no later than 
five days after the command action is complete.  The report shall include:

Family Support Center is not a reportable CCA.  If the commander decides not 
to pursue command action the CCA would be reported as "No Action Taken" in 
the OTHER category.  No action taken is usually the result of insufficient 
evidence for disciplinary processing or the commander made a determination 
that no action would be taken because disciplinary or administrative action 
was not warranted under guidance as cited in Rules for Courts-Martial 306.
