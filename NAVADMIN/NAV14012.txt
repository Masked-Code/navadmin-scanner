RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Coalition of Sailors Against 
Destructive Decisions (CSADD) Sea and Shore Chapters of the Year 
(COY) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2013. 

2.  It is with great pleasure that I announce the CSADD Sea and 
Shore COY for FY-13.  This year's judging was more difficult than 
ever.  All nomination packages provided great examples of how CSADD 
Sailors help foster a positive image of our young Sailors to our 
communities in the U.S. and abroad.

3.  The winner of the FY-13 CSADD Large Sea COY is USS RONALD REAGAN
(CVN 76).  Honorable Mention is awarded to USS GEORGE WASHINGTON 
(CVN 73).

4.  The winner of the FY-13 CSADD Small Sea COY is USS LAKE ERIE 
(CG 70).  Honorable mention is awarded to USS MUSTIN (DDG 89).

5.  The winner of the FY-13 CSADD Shore Installation COY is the 
Washington Navy Yard CSADD chapter.  Honorable Mention is awarded to
NAVSTA Rota. 

6.  The winner of the FY-13 CSADD Shore Training Command COY is 
NMTSC Fort Sam Houston.  Honorable Mention is awarded to CSS DINFOS 
Detachment.

7.  Some of the best practices that made the winning chapters stand 
out:
    a.  CSADD included in the command indoctrination course.
    b.  CSADD participation in life skills workshops for successful 
naval career.
    c.  Use of Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute survey
results to aid CSADD messaging efforts.
    d.  Use of multiple network resources, social media, and dynamic
cohesion with other organizations and associations (e.g. Morale, 
Welfare, and Recreation, Fleet and Family Support Center, Chief 
Petty Officers Association, First Class Petty Officers Association, 
Navy College).
    e.  Ability to capture/document impact on behavior changes 
toward command success (e.g. reduction in alcohol related incidents,
and increases in college enrollment and CSADD membership).
    f.  Commanding officer, executive officer, and command master 
chief participation in CSADD events/meetings.
    g.  Active membership/participation.

8.  Congratulations to all the FY-13 CSADD COY winners and all 
nominated chapters!  The cornerstone of a CSADD chapter is 
leadership providing junior Sailors an opportunity to lead, 
influence, and mentor their peers to make the right decisions on and
off-duty.  I applaud the efforts of all CSADD chapters 
across the Fleet and look forward to hearing about their FY-14
accomplishments.

9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or 31 
December 2014, whichever occurs first.
