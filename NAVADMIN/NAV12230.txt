RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN, IN CONJUNCTION WITH REF A AND EFFORTS TO ADDRESS 
CRITICAL SENIOR ENLISTED LEADERSHIP MANNING ISSUES IN OUR DEPLOYING FORCES, 
ANNOUNCES THE CHIEF PETTY OFFICER (CPO) EARLY RETURN TO SEA DUTY PROGRAM WHICH 
PUTS NEW DETAILING BUSINESS RULES IN PLACE REGARDING SENIOR ENLISTED LEADERS 
(E7-E9).  THIS PROGRAM, WHICH WAS DESIGNED IN COOPERATION WITH U.S. FLEET 
FORCES COMMAND AND THE MASTER CHIEF PETTY OFFICER OF THE NAVY TO ENSURE HIGH 
PRIORITY SENIOR ENLISTED LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AT SEA ARE SUFFICIENTLY MANNED, 
WILL ENABLE THE EARLY REASSIGNMENT TO SEA OF CPOS ON SHORE DUTY POSSESSING 
CRITICAL SKILLS REQUIRED BY OUR DEPLOYING UNITS.  THIS PROGRAM IS DIFFERENT 
FROM THE LIMITED DIRECTED DETAILING PROGRAM ANNOUNCED IN REF B WHICH IS 
FOCUSED ON FILLING NEAR TERM MANNING GAPS.  THE CPO EARLY RETURN TO SEA 
PROGRAM IS FOCUSED ON THE LONG TERM AND IS INTENDED TO REMAIN IN PLACE AS A 
MEANS OF MAINTAINING THE REQUIRED LEVEL OF CRITICAL SENIOR ENLISTED LEADERSHIP 
AT SEA.

2.  SENIOR ENLISTED DETAILING BUSINESS RULES/GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR CPO EARLY 
RETURN TO SEA VIA CURTAILMENT OF SHORE DUTY ARE AS FOLLOWS:
    A.  APPLIES TO SENIOR ENLISTED LEADERS (E7-E9) SAILORS IN ALL RATINGS.
    B.  TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF CPOS IMPACTED BY EARLY CURTAILMENT OF SHORE 
DUTY, DETAILERS WILL FILL AS MANY HIGH PRIORITY E7-E9 SEA DUTY BILLETS AS 
POSSIBLE BY FULLY UTILIZING THE AUTHORIZED TRANSFER WINDOW.  CURRENT POLICY 
ALLOWS DETAILERS TO TRANSFER SAILORS UP TO THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO, OR FOUR 
MONTHS BEYOND, PROJECTED ROTATION DATE (PRD).  INVOLUNTARY CURTAILMENT OF 
SHORE DUTY WILL ONLY BE USED WHEN THERE ARE NO AVAILABLE CPOS IN THE PRD 
WINDOW AND THERE ARE NO EXCESS PERSONNEL ON SEA DUTY WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHIC 
AREA WHO CAN BE REASSIGNED.  EXCEPT TO MEET THE MOST CRITICAL OPERATIONAL 
REQUIREMENTS, ONLY SAILORS WHO HAVE COMPLETED AT LEAST 24 MONTHS OF SHORE DUTY 
AT THE TIME OF TRANSFER WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR EARLY RETURN TO SEA.
    C.  CANDIDATES WILL BE SELECTED BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS, WHICH
INCLUDE:  LENGTH OF TIME ON SHORE, RECENT ADVANCEMENT, FLEET EXPERIENCE, 
NEC/SKILLS HELD, TYPE OF PREVIOUS SEA DUTY, AND REMAINING OBLISERV.  IMPACT ON 
THE SHORE DUTY COMMAND'S MISSION WILL ALSO BE EVALUATED.  E8/9 SAILORS MAY BE 
CHOSEN TO FILL VACANT E7/8/9 BILLETS AND E7 SAILORS MAY BE CHOSEN TO FILL 
VACANT E8 BILLETS.
    D.  IF EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES OR MISSION REQUIREMENTS PRECLUDE AN 
ELIGIBLE CPO FROM EXECUTING THE SEA DUTY ASSIGNMENT, THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES MUST 
BE SUBMITTED TO PERS-40 IN WRITING, WITH COMMAND ENDORSEMENT, WITHIN 30 DAYS 
OF BEING IDENTIFIED AS A REPLACEMENT UNDER THIS POLICY.  PERS-4 IS THE FLAG 
REVIEW AUTHORITY FOR SUCH CASES.
    E.  REQUESTS TO TRANSFER TO THE FLEET RESERVE, SUBMITTED SUBSEQUENT TO 
SELECTION FOR EARLY RETURN TO SEA BY CPOS WITH MORE THAN ONE YEAR OF CONTRACT 
TIME REMAINING, MAY BE DISAPPROVED.
    F.  HIGH YEAR TENURE (HYT) WAIVER REQUESTS FOR CPOS CHOSEN FOR EARLY 
RETURN TO SEA WILL RECEIVE FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION.
    G.  CPOS WITH A NUCLEAR NEC (33XX) WILL CONTINUE TO BE DETAILED PER NAVAL 
NUCLEAR PROPULSION PROGRAM PRIORITIES.

3.  TO ENCOURAGE CPOS TO VOLUNTARILY RETURN TO SEA DUTY, THE FOLLOWING 
INCENTIVES ARE CURRENTLY OFFERED VIA THE VOLUNTARY SEA DUTY PROGRAM AS 
OUTLINED IN REFS C, D AND E.
    A.  GEOGRAPHIC CHOICE OR STABILITY;
    B.  HYT WAIVER CONSIDERATION; AND
    C.  SEA DUTY INCENTIVE PAY FOR ELIGIBLE RATINGS.

4.  REF F, NAVADMIN 221/97, CHIEF PETTY OFFICER TO SEA POLICY, IS HEREBY 
CANCELLED.

5.  FOR THE NAVY TO CONTINUE MEETING WORLD-WIDE OPERATIONAL COMMITMENTS, WE 
MUST MAINTAIN AT-SEA MANNING READINESS.  THESE CHANGES WILL HELP US ENSURE 
CRITICAL SENIOR ENLISTED LEADERSHIP IS WHERE WE NEED IT MOST.
