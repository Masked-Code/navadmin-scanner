REF/A/DOC/DON CIO WASHINGTON DC/20140410
NARR/REF A IS DON CIO MEMO, DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY TASK AND RECORDS
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.

RMKS/1.  Purpose.  This NAVADMIN announces the plan to implement the task 
management (TM) function of Department of the Navy (DON) Tasking, Records and 
Consolidated Knowledge Enterprise Repository (TRACKER) for the OPNAV Staff 
and Echelon II Commands, per REF A. DON TRACKER can be accessed at 
https://dontracker.navy.mil.

2.  General.  DON TRACKER is a single enterprise solution to replace multiple 
legacy Department-wide TM and records management (RM) applications in order 
to streamline digital tasking and recordkeeping at a lower cost across the 
Secretariat, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps.  This plan affects OPNAV and 
commands currently using the NIPR TV5 task management system and 
Congressional Information Management System (CIMS).  Current TV5 and CIMS 
users must register in DON TRACKER at https://dontracker.navy.mil no later 
than 28 October 2016.

3.  Training.  The training CONOPS is based on the train-the-trainer 
methodology.  The schedule for contractor provided training has been 
promulgated through the DON TRACKER Transition Portal at
https://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs/OPNAV/COP/TRACK.  If not already done, 
commands should identify their primary TV5 and CIMS "power users" capable of 
providing training to other personnel to attend the contractor provided 
trainings held in the NCR, Millington, Norfolk and San Diego.  Organizations 
shall develop internal protocols for the training of other members within 
their organizations; fully utilizing the personnel who receive PMW-240 
provided face-to-face training.  Training material is available on the DON 
TRACKER website and the DON Tracker Transition Portal.

4.  Scope.  DON TRACKER will provide the Navy an effective TM system and lays 
the foundation for follow on RM compliance.  Per REF A, DON TRACKER will 
become the enterprise solution for all DON TM and RM and no new investment 
should be made in TM and RM systems.  The Marine Corps began using NIPR DON 
Tracker in April 2016 and the Office of the Secretary of the Navy will 
transition in September 2016.  Secret Internet Protocol (SIPR) DON TRACKER 
implementation is planned for FY18 and transition plans will be promulgated 
SEPCOR.

5.  Deployment.  OPNAV will utilize a phased approach for the deployment of 
DON Tracker.  All contractors provided classroom training will be completed 
by 30 September 2016.  During the month of October, OPNAV and Echelon II and 
III commands will execute organizational plans to ensure all users requiring 
training are trained and familiar with DON Tracker.  Starting on 1 November 
2016, DNS will begin to issue taskers via DON TRACKER on a limited basis to 
allow OPNAV and Echelon II commands to execute a controlled transition to DON 
TRACKER.  This transition period will end NLT 1 March 2017.

6.  Transition Coordinators.  A list of OPNAV and Echelon II Transition 
Coordinators is located on the DON TRACKER Transition Portal.  If unable to 
identify your coordinator, please contact LCDR Jerardo Reyna.

7.  Sundown of TV5.  New TV5 tasking capability will be disabled no later 
than 1 March 2017 at which time all new tasks must be initiated and processed 
in DON TRACKER.  If a task is assigned or delegated via DON TRACKER, the 
response must be submitted via DON TRACKER.  Users may continue to work 
existing TV5 tasks with due dates prior to 31 May 2017.  On 1 June 2017, TV5 
will be taken off-line and will no longer be used.  During this sundown 
period, any TV5 tasks with due dates after 31 May 2017 will need to be 
manually entered into DON TRACKER and marked complete in TV5 with a comment 
added that the tasker has been migrated to a DON TRACKER tasker number.

8.  Data Migration for TV5.  All TV5 files (tasks, document reviews, 
responses) closed and archived on or before 1 September 2016 will be migrated 
to DON TRACKER for Initial Operating Capability (IOC).  TV5 tasks closed 
between 1 September 2016 and 31 May 2017 will be migrated to DON TRACKER 
after 1 June 2017.

9.  CIMS Transition and Data Migration.  Details for the transition and data 
migration from CIMS to DON TRACKER will be promulgated through the DON 
TRACKER Transition Portal and SEPCOR.

10.  DON TRACKER Customer Support.  Customers will initiate service requests 
for technical assistance via the Navy 311 Help Desk at 1-855-NAVY-311.  TV5 
customer support can be reached at 703-695-9093 and will remain in place
