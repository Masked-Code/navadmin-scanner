SUBJ/POLICY FOR ACTIVATION AND EMPLOYMENT OF RESERVE COMPONENT FORCES// 
 
REF/A/DOC/SECNAV/30JAN2023// 
REF/B/DOC/-/TITLE 10 U.S.C.// 
 
NARR/Reference (a) is SECNAV Memo of 30JAN2023 which expands the ability to 
access Reserve Component (RC) Sailors for involuntary activation. 
Reference (b) is Title 10 U.S.C. 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides Navy's Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) policy per 
reference (a), defining policy for the activation and employment of RC forces 
until 30 September 2023.  Subsequent annual NAVADMINs will be released in 
advance of Individual Augmentee (IA) sourcing for the next FY in order to 
provide Active Component (AC) and RC IA fulfillment guidance. 
 
2.  Background.  Reference (a) directs Total Force sourcing and sharing of IA 
requirements through Service policies that implement careful management of 
Selective Reservist (SELRES) mobilizations within reference (b) authorities. 
 
3.  Policy.  A Total Force sourcing solution is needed to enable the Navy's 
flexible response to global crisis, while supporting the RC focus on growing 
capacity and capability to compete in a high-end conflict.  In support of a 
Total Force sourcing solution, RC utilization for FY23 IA billets will be 
capped at 50 percent of the total requirement for the fiscal year.  When 
required, involuntary activation of SELRES members will be accomplished 
through billet-based activation (BBA) in accordance with the guidance 
contained in reference (a).  This ensures RC Sailors maintain currency for 
strategic competition either by fulfilling IA requirements that contribute 
substantially to maintaining their specific billet or core capability 
skillsets.  BBA will provide training and experience for RC Sailors to 
promote warfighting readiness. 
 
4. RC personnel are authorized and highly encouraged to volunteer for 
mobilization opportunities.  These activations will continue to be viewed 
favorably for career development as well as promotion and advancement, as 
directed in selection board convening orders and precepts. 
 
5.  In addition to mobilizations, the RC provides activations supporting the 
AC via Active Duty for Operational Support, Active Duty Training and 
voluntary Definite Recalls.  AC commands may plan and budget for continued 
and even expanded utilization of these resources in order to access RC 
support.
