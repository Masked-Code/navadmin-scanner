EDUCATION (VOLED)// 
REF/A/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/091035ZJUN2006// AMPN/REF A IS 
NAVADMIN 166/06, TUITION ASSISTANCE AND WAIVER POLICY.// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN UPDATES AND EXPANDS VOLED POLICY OUTLINED BY REF 
A.  SUSTAINING COMBAT READINESS, BUILDING A FLEET FOR THE FUTURE
AND DEVELOPING 21ST CENTURY LEADERS CONTINUE TO BE THE CHIEF OF NAVAL 
OPERATIONS* TOP PRIORITIES.  PROFESSIONAL GROWTH THAT PREPARES SAILORS 
FOR RELEVANT AND CHALLENGING NAVY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES THROUGH 
VOLED DEVELOPS THE SAILORS WE NEED BOTH TODAY AND TOMORROW.
2.  NAVY LEADERSHIP IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES AND 
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO SAILORS AS THEY PURSUE THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS.  
MAXIMIZING EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE GREATEST NUMBER OF SAILORS, 
GIVEN THE RISING COST OF EDUCATION AND LIMITED BUDGETS, DEMANDS THAT WE 
IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT CONTROLS FOR THE TUITION ASSISTANCE (TA) 
PROGRAM AND NAVY COLLEGE PROGRAM FOR AFLOAT COLLEGE EDUCATION (NCPACE).  
WHILE THESE PROGRAMS ARE FULLY FUNDED, THESE NEW CONTROLS FOCUS ON 
THREE AREAS (SAILOR READINESS, CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAM/FISCAL 
EFFICIENCIES) AND SERVE TO SHARE THIS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE 
GREATEST NUMBER OF SAILORS.  THESE CONTROLS ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY 
FOR NEW TA AND NCPACE ENROLLMENT AND WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL 
FURTHER NOTICE.
3.  THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY FOR ALL NEW SAILORS (OFFICER AND 
ENLISTED) IS ON LEARNI NG THEIR NAVY PROFESSION.  LEADERS, MENTORS AND 
PEERS ARE DEDICATED TO PROVIDING EVERY SAILOR THE TRAINING, EXPERIENCE 
AND OPPORTUNITIES THEY NEED TO DEVELOP WITHIN A DESIGNATOR/RATING AND 
TO EARN THEIR WARFARE AND PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS.  PHYSICAL 
READINESS AND TIME MANAGEMENT ARE ALSO CRITICAL FACTORS THAT DETERMINE 
THE SAILOR*S ABILITY TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR MISSION.  TO ENSURE THIS 
PROPER FOCUS IS APPLIED TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND READINESS, 
SAILORS SHALL MEET ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA BEFORE RECEIVING 
AUTHORIZATION TO USE TA OR ENROLL IN NCPACE COURSES FOR POST-SECONDARY 
LEVEL COURSES:
    A.  ADVANCEMENT ELIGIBLE SAILORS MUST HAVE TAKEN AND PASSED THEIR 
MOST RECENT ADVANCEMENT EXAM.  SAILORS WHO ARE SERVING OUT OF THEIR 
RATING AND HAVE NOT PASSED THEIR ADVANCEMENT EXAM ARE ELIGIBLE FOR TA 
AND NCPACE WITH THE APPROVAL OF THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER/OFFICER IN 
CHARGE.
    B.  SAILORS MUST PASS (OR BE MEDICALLY WAIVED FROM) THEIR MOST 
RECENT PHYSICAL READINESS TEST (PRT).
    C.  SAILORS MUST NOT BE UNDER INSTRUCTION IN INITIAL SKILLS 
TRAINING OR IN A DUTY UNDER INSTRUCTION (DUINS) TRAINING STATUS.
    D.  SAILORS MUST BE RECOMMENDED FOR PROMOTION OR ADVANCEMENT (AS 
APPLICABLE).
    E.  SAILORS WHO HAVE BEEN AWARDED NON-JUDICIAL OR COURTS-MARTIAL
PUNISHMENT IN THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS SHALL NOT BE AUTHORIZED TA OR 
NCPACE COURSES.
4.  THE ACADEMIC SKILLS PROGRAM IS NOT IMPACTED BY THIS POLICY AND 
COMMA NDING OFFICERS SHOULD ENCOURAGE SAILORS TO CONTINUE TO USE THIS 
PROGRAM AS NEEDED TO DEVELOP ENGLISH, READING AND BASIC MATH SKILLS.
5.  EDUCATION IS A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE OF OUR NAVY.
WE WILL TAKE A DELIBERATE APPROACH TO PROVIDE LIFE-LONG LEARNING AND 
DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES, SEQUENCED TO MEET THE GROWING AND CHANGING 
ROLES SAILORS EXPERIENCE THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREER.  TO ENCOURAGE 
ACCOMPLISHMENT OF EDUCATION GOALS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES WITHIN A 
CAREER AND ALLOW SAILORS TO SUPPORT THE MISSION THROUGH WHAT THEY HAVE 
LEARNED, SAILORS SHOULD BE COUNSELED TO INTEGRATE POTENTIAL LEARNING 
OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT A CAREER.
     A.  BY STATUTE, OFFICERS WILL INCUR A MINIMUM TWO-YEAR SERVICE 
OBLIGATION FOR TA AND NCPACE COURSES COMMENCING WITH THEIR COMPLETION 
OF (OR WITHDRAWAL FROM) THE PROGRAM.  THIS TWO-YEAR SERVICE OBLIGATION 
WILL BE SERVED CONCURRENTLY WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE OBLIGATION.
    B.  ENLISTED PERSONNEL WITH LESS THAN 20 YEARS IN SERVICE ARE
NOW REQUIRED TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE YEAR REMAINING ON THEIR CURRENT 
ENLISTMENT PRIOR TO USING TA OR ENROLLING IN NCPACE COURSES.
6.  NAVY IS COMMITTED TO FUNDING 16 SEMESTER HOURS FOR TA, BUT MUST DO 
SO IN A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER.
    A.  IN ORDER TO RECEIVE AUTHORIZATION FOR ADDITIONAL TA (BEYOND
16 SEMESTER HOURS) AND/OR NCPACE, SAILORS MUST HAVE AN APPROVED 
ACADEMIC/EDUCATION PLAN AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THEIR FIFTH COURSE.
NAVY COLLEGE OFFIC
E COUNSELORS WILL ASSIST SAILORS IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PLAN.  ONLY COURSES REQUIRED BY THE 
ACADEMIC/EDUCATION PLAN WILL BE AUTHORIZED FOR TA AND NCPACE.
    B.  TA WILL NO LONGER BE AUTHORIZED FOR COURSES USED TO EARN AN 
ADDITIONAL DEGREE AT THE SAME OR LOWER EDUCATION LEVEL.  LOWER DIVISION 
OR PREREQUISITE COURSES MAY BE AUTHORIZED IF THE COURSES ARE PART OF A 
SAILOR*S DEGREE PROGRAM AND ARE LISTED ON THEIR APPROVED EDUCATION PLAN.  
SAILORS ALREADY PURSUING A DEGREE AT THE SAME OR LOWER LEVEL MAY 
CONTINUE TAKING COURSES PROVIDED THEIR APPROVED EDUCATION PLAN IS DATED 
DEC 2005 OR EARLIER.
    C.  TA WILL NO LONGER BE AUTHORIZED FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION UNITS 
(CEUS).
7.  SAILORS WHO ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN TA AND/OR NCPACE COURSES, AND 
HAVE NOT MET THE CONDITIONS LISTED ABOVE, SHALL BE ALLOWED TO COMPLETE 
THEIR CURRENT COURSES.  NEW AUTHORIZATIONS OR FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL 
COURSES WILL NOT BE APPROVED UNTIL THESE CONDITIONS OUTLINED IN PARAS 
4-6 ARE MET.
8.  EXPERIENCE TELLS US THAT FIRST DUTY ASSIGNMENTS ARE CHALLENGING AND 
RIGOROUS.  MANAGING ONE*S TIME WHILE LEARNING THE JOB IS A KEY FACTOR 
IN CAREER SUCCESS.  TO IMPROVE THEIR ODDS FOR SUCCESS, SAILORS ARE 
STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO COMPLETE ALL WARFARE AND PROFESSIONAL 
QUALIFICATIONS PRIOR TO REQUESTING TA OR ENROLLING IN NCPACE COURSES.  
SAILORS WHO ENROLL IN COLLEGE COURSES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY WORKING ON 
THEIR PROFESSIONAL/WARFARE QUALIFICATIONS MAY FIND  THEMSELVES UNABLE 
TO COMPLETE COURSES DUE TO THE HEAVY WORKLOAD AND FORCED TO WITHDRAW.  
THESE WITHDRAWALS REPRESENT BOTH SQUANDERED EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES AND 
RESOURCES.
9.  COMMAND LEADERSHIP IS A CRITICAL FACTOR IN THE SUCCESSFUL 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE POLICIES.  COMMANDING OFFICERS MUST ENSURE THAT 
PROFESSIONAL AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET PRIOR TO 
APPROVING A REQUEST TO USE TA OR ENROLL IN NCPACE COURSES.

NAVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING (NETC) WILL PROMULGATE STANDARDIZED 
EXECUTION GUIDELINES AND CRITERIA FOR WAIVERS BY SEPARATE COVER.  NAVY 
COLLEGE OFFICE COUNSELORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE EFFECTIVE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM AND FISCAL EFFICIENCIES AS OUTLINED IN 
PARA 6 ABOVE.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND AT 
HTTPS:\\WWW.NAVYCOLLEGE.NAVY.MIL/.
11.  PREPARING OUR 21ST CENTURY SAILORS FOR THE COMPLEX, DYNAMIC WORLD 
WE LIVE IN WILL CONTINUE TO DEMAND THAT WE PROVIDE FOR AND GUIDE THEIR 
VOLUNTARY EDUCATION PROGRAMS.  DOING SO REQUIRES METICULOUSLY PREPARED 
EDUCATION PLANS FOCUSED ON LEARNING, MAINTAINING, AND MASTERING THE 
INTRICACIES OF OUR CRAFT.  SINCE THE INVESTMENT NAVY MAKES IN EDUCATION 
IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE NECESSARY TO YIELD 
OPERATIONAL EXPERTISE, THE NATURE AND TIMING OF OUR EDUCATION 
INVESTMENTS MUST BE TAILORED TO EACH SAILOR*S STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT.
