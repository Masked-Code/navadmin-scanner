ensure all stakeholders in the ship inactivation process are aware of the

reflected in paragraph 2 below align with the enacted FY22 National Defense 
Authorization Act and FY22 omnibus appropriations bill.

continuous maintenance availability (CMAV) or inactivation availability 
(INAC), the projected schedule for inactivating U.S. battle force and  
non-battle force naval vessels in FY22 is promulgated as follows:

3.  Per ref (b), Fleet Commanders shall submit an OCR for commissioned U.S. 
ships to formally notify the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) 
of a ship's decommissioning, inactivation, or end of service.  Submit 
revisions due to operational schedule changes per references (a) and (b).  It 
is the responsibility of Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command and Commander, 
U.S. Pacific Fleet in coordination with their respective TYCOM to ensure the 
appropriate lower echelon commands are notified of any changes in the ship 
inactivation schedules, as well as Integrated Warfare (OPNAV N9I) and OPNAV 
resource sponsor. 
 
4.  Adjustments to paragraph 2 ship inactivations that cross the current 
fiscal year must be coordinated with OPNAV N9I due to Congressional 
requirements for execution year force structure changes that differ from what 
Congress authorized/appropriated and signed into law by the President.  OPNAV 
shall promulgate changes to the inactivation fiscal year as required. 
 
5.  The ship's commanding officer, masters, or Immediate Superior In Command, 
shall submit a final naval message (normally transmitted in conjunction with 
the decommissioning ceremony) announcing the ship's official retirement date 
and include a brief history of the significant events in the life of the ship 
per ref (a).  The Naval History and Heritage Command (NAVHISTHERITAGECOM 
WASHINGTON DC) and Naval Vessel Register Custodian (NVR NORFOLK VA), shall be 
included as INFO addees.
