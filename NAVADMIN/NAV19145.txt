RESERVE//

REF/A/GENADMIN/CNO N1 WASHINGTON DC/161306ZJAN07//
REF/B/DOC/USC/9JUL52//
REF/C/DOC/COMNAVRESFOR/19JUL18//
NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 007/07, MOBILIZATION DEFERMENT POLICY FOR TRANSITION 
FROM ACTIVE COMPONENT TO RESERVE COMPONENT. 
REF B REF B IS TITLE 10 U.S. CODE SECTION 12302, READY RESERVE.  
REF C IS THE NAVY RESERVE PERSONNEL MANUAL.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a).  Reference (b) authorizes 
involuntary recall of any Reservist to active service, with consideration for 
fair treatment.  Reference (c) further promulgates mobilization deferment 
guidance.

2.  Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) Sailors continue to 
support global operational requirements with dedication and outstanding 
service to the Fleet and Combatant Commanders.

3.  In support of veterans who choose to affiliate with the Navy Reserve (as 
drilling Reservists in a pay status), to allow for a reasonable transition 
period, the following involuntary mobilization deferment policy is 
implemented upon release of this NAVADMIN.

4.  Program Guidance
    a.  All Navy Veteran (NAVET) and Other Service Veteran (OSVET) personnel, 
to include those members of the Individual Ready Reserve, (Voluntary Training 
Unit and Active Status Pool) who affiliate with the Navy Reserve qualify for 
a 1-year deferment from involuntary mobilization, commencing on the Selected 
Reserve affiliation date.
All NAVET and OSVET personnel who affiliate within 6 months (183 days) of 
release from Active Duty qualify for a 2-year deferment from involuntary 
mobilization, commencing on the Selected Reserve affiliation date.  Members 
qualify for one mobilization deferment, associated with their first Navy 
Reserve affiliation.
    b.  Deferments are applicable under current operational tempo and apply 
to all Sailors who affiliate through the NAVET or OSVET program (regardless 
of previous deployment schedule, last duty station, Navy enlisted 
classification held or designator).  All direct Navy Reserve accessions, upon 
transitioning to Selected Reserve status following initial training 
period(s), remain ineligible for deferment.
    c.  Upon transitioning, the Sailors gaining Navy Operational Support 
Center (NOSC) will ensure a Manpower Availability Status (MAS) code of AS1 
(for a 1-year deferment) or TS1 (for a 2-year deferment) is entered into the 
Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System.  The NOSC will ensure NAVETS and 
OSVETS are properly coded on the Reserve Unit Activity Document and will 
track the total time of deferment.  Upon reaching the end of the deferment 
period, the NOSC will remove the MAS code.  Accurate accounting of the 
effective dates for the AS1 and TS1 MAS codes is imperative.
    d.  Sailors may volunteer for a mobilization at any time during the 
deferment period.  Upon signing Administrative Remarks (NAVPERS 1070/613) 
voluntary waiver of deferment, the NOSC will remove or change the MAS code to 
VOL (from AS1 or TS1) to reflect a volunteer status.  If the Sailor desires 
to remove the VOL MAS code and is not currently identified for mobilization, 
the AS1 or TS1 may be re-entered until the original 1- or 2-year deferment 
date from affiliation has passed.

5.  This policy will be maintained and updated by the Chief of Navy Reserve 
through the Navy Reserve Personnel Manual M-1001.5.

6.  Released by Vice Admiral John B. Nowell, Jr, N1.//
