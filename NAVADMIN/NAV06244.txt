SUBJ/OBSERVANCE OF HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 2006//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  IN 1968, CONGRESS AUTHORIZED THE PRESIDENT TO

CELEBRATES THE TRADITIONS, ANCESTRY, AND UNIQUE EXPERIENCES OF THOSE
WHO TRACE THEIR ROOTS TO SPAIN, MEXICO, THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND
SOUTH AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN.
2.  THIS YEAR NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH WILL BE OBSERVED FROM
