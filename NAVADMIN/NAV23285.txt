SUBJ/CNLSC CELEBRATES 50TH ANNIVERSARY// 
 
RMKS/1. On 3 December 2023, Naval Legal Service Command (NLSC) celebrates 50 
years of providing outstanding legal support to the Fleet, Sailors, families, 
and retirees. 
 
2.  NLSC has grown from a scattering of district legal offices charged with 
administering the Navy legal readiness program to a Fleet-focused readiness 
entity that preserves the fair administration of justice and provides 
essential solutions and advice to shore commanders, individual Sailors, and 
their families, allowing our Navy team to concentrate on mission one: the 
operational readiness of the Navy. 
 
3.  Today NLSC consists of eight Region Legal Service Offices (RLSOs) in 53 
locations, four Defense Service Offices (DSOs) in 19 locations, and the 
Victims Legal Counsel Program (VLCP) in 28 locations.  The NLSC team 
of more than 850 active duty officer, enlisted, and civilian personnel along 
with the support from our reserve teammates provide a wide range of legal 
services in support of the US Navy warfighting advantage and furtherance of 
the rules based international order. 
 
4.  RLSOs focus on providing legal assistance services, legal advice to 
installations and commands without judge advocates, and prosecution for good 
order and discipline offenses outside the jurisdiction of the Office of 
Special Trial Counsel (OSTC).  Although the military justice system has 
transformed over the years, such as the newly Congressional-created OSTC, 
RLSOs remain steady at the helm upholding the Navy values of honor, courage, 
and commitment by prosecuting misconduct consistent with due process.  The 
legal assistance team works relentlessly to ensure Sailors and their families 
feel prepared and protected through legal challenges such as providing 
schooling legal support to Exceptional Family Member Program families.   
Command services, consisting of staff judge advocates, is dedicated to 
providing timely, accurate advice to commanders across the globe. 
 
5.  DSOs advocate tirelessly for Sailors ensuring their Constitutional rights 
are protected and they receive the highest quality advice and representation 
for legal concerns.  The DSO embodies the Navy warfighting spirit in its 
delivery of legal representation: protecting our Service members when they 
need it most. 
 
6.  Although the VLCP is the newest mission to NLSC, it is a vital component 
of the organization.  VLCP is committed to providing victims of a sexual or 
domestic violence offense with a dedicated attorney to help them understand 
the investigation and military justice process, guard their legal rights, and 
connect them to additional resources to advance their recovery.  VLCP 
embodies the commitment we as a Navy have to helping victims through some of 
their most difficult days and is a key enabler of the readiness mission of 
the Navy.
