SUBJ/50th ANNIVERSARY OF THE NAVY JAG CORPS// POC//PATRICIA BABB, OFFICE OF 
THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL OF THE NAVY/
EMAIL:  PATRICIA.BABB(AT)NAVY.MIL/TEL:  (202) 685-5493//

RMKS/1.  On behalf of our worldwide Navy, I extend congratulations to the men 
and women of the Navy's Judge Advocate General's (JAG) Corps, in celebrating 
the organization's 50th anniversary on 8 December 2017.

2.  For half a century, in times of conflict and peace, both afloat and 
ashore, our judge advocates have provided steady counsel to commanders, 
Service members, retirees, and families.  You have supplied the legal 
expertise needed to conduct complex military operations tackling the most 
difficult questions facing our warfighters while remaining devoted to the 
Navy's core values of courage, honor, and commitment.

3.  As you celebrate the rich heritage of the JAG Corps from its inception in 
1967 to today's JAG Corps, which to date includes more than 1,300 
accomplished Reserve and active-duty judge advocates, know that service 
members around the globe salute you.  You, and those who have come before 
you, have made a lasting contribution to our military, and to its mission to 
defend our Nation.

4.  Thank you for your dedication to service and commitment to excellence.  
Happy Anniversary!

5.  Released by Vice Admiral K. M. Donegan, Director, Navy Staff.//
