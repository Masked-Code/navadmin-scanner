RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces eligibility requirements and application 
procedures for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT)-Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) Joint Masters 
Degree in Oceanography Program.  Where information differs between this 
NAVADMIN and reference (a), this NAVADMIN takes precedence.  This world-class 
program offers deep knowledge of ocean processes, ocean vehicles and 
instrumentation, acoustics, and signal processing.  Furthermore, it seeks to 
enhance understanding and application of operational oceanography as it 
pertains to the Undersea Warfare domain. 
 
2.  Five quotas are available for the June 2023 program start.  Applications 
can be submitted online starting 1 July 2022 at  
https://gradapply.mit.edu/whoi/apply/login/?next=/whoi/_navy.   
The application fee is waived for all active duty applicants.  Applicants 
should contact Ms. Patricia Nesti (contact information below) prior to 
applying to receive an application fee waiver code.  MIT 
deadline for applications is 1 October 2022.  Program information and 
admission requirements can be found online at https://mit.whoi.edu/, within 
reference (a), and from the points of contact provided in this 
message.  Additionally, instructions to sign up for education program 
notification are available at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/training-

period of three years after completion of or withdrawal from the program.   
For any officer participating in this program without first serving a tour in 
a permanent fleet billet (immediate graduate education), the service

initial service obligation, not to exceed 10 years from the date of 
commissioning. 
 
5.  Selectees are eligible for the 6402P subspecialty code (Operational 
Oceanography) after fully satisfying the educational skill requirements. 
 
6.  Selectees may defer enrollment for up to one year to meet operational and 
detailing requirements.

Science and Engineering field of study is associated with the Mechanical 
Engineering Department at MIT and the Department of Applied Ocean Physics and 
Engineering Department at WHOI.  The Physical Oceanography field of study is 
associated with Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT and the 
Department of Physical Oceanography at WHOI.  Applicants must select the 
field for which they are applying during the application process. 
 
8.  Interested applicants should submit an online application directly to the 
MIT-WHOI Joint Program.  Graduate Record Examination (GRE) results are not a 
mandatory component of the application this year.  However, if applicants

convened to select the five candidates.
