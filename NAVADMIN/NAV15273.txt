2.  If a selected officer does not decline his or her promotion in writing 
prior to his or her projected date of rank (noted above in paragraph 1), that 
officer is considered to have accepted the promotion on the date indicated.  
An officer who chooses to decline his or her promotion must submit the 
declination in writing to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806), prior to the effective 
date indicated above.  Limited duty officers declining appointment to 
lieutenant will be reverted to enlisted status within 90 days of projected 
promotion date.

3.  The commanding officer (CO), the Secretary of the Navy or his designee, 
have the authority to delay projected appointments.  Upon the exercise of a 
delay, the officer shall be notified in writing before the effective date of 
the appointment, and not be tendered the appointment.  The delay authority 
will immediately forward the recommendation to delay with supporting 
documentation to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-83), copy to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806).

4.  COs are reminded of their responsibility to ensure the officers they are 
promoting are mentally, physically, morally and
professionally qualified.   Per reference (a), officers are
ineligible for promotion if they have failed the most recent Physical Fitness 
Assessment.  COs shall verify the promoting officer's information in the 
Physical Readiness Information Management System (PRIMS) to ensure compliance 
with reference (a) and delay the officers promotion in accordance with 
paragraph 3 if required.

5.  Prepare a Delivery of Temporary/Permanent Appointment (NAVPERS form 
1421/7) (Rev 10-13).  Use this NAVADMIN as reference (a).  Use section 624 of 
title 10, U.S. Code as reference (b), for permanent lieutenants and above.  
Use section 578 of title 10, U.S. Code as reference (b), for chief warrant 
officers.  Use sections 624 and
5589 of title 10, U.S. Code as reference (b), for limited duty officer 
promotion to lieutenant.  Limited duty officer appointment to lieutenant is a 
permanent appointment; acceptance of the appointment is acceptance of 
permanent appointment as a limited duty officer.  Mail the completed form to 
COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806).

6.  Officers should review reference (b), for minimum time-in-grade 
requirements for purposes of voluntary retirement.  Full time support 
officers and those officers temporarily on active duty anticipating release 
from active duty under reference (c), may accept promotion without incurring 
any additional active duty obligation.

7.  New photographs are required for all officers within three months after 
acceptance of promotion.  See reference (d), for specific requirements.
