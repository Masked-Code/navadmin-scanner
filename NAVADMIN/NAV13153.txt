RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the establishment of Navy's Twenty-First Century Sailor Office 
(N17).  

2.  N17 is a new directorate responsible for the integration of the Navy's objectives for Sailor Personal 
and Family Readiness, Physical Readiness, Substance Abuse Prevention, Suicide Prevention, SAPR, Equal 
Opportunity, and Hazing Prevention policy.  RDML Ted Carter has assumed the duties as Director, N17 
effective 1 June 2013.   

3.  Specifics.  N17 will initially include the following branches:
A.  Total Sailor Fitness Branch (N170).  N170, previously N135F, will manage the policies that build and 
sustain resilience in the force.  N170 will be comprised of: Navy Alcohol and Drug Abuse Program 
(NADAP) (N170A); Physical Readiness (N170B); and Family Readiness (e.g., community support, family 
advocacy, exceptional family member, and retired affairs policies) (N170C).  
B.  Suicide Prevention Branch (N171).  N171, previously N135H, will manage policy and programs 
encompassing suicide prevention and resilience initiatives.  N171 will also investigate events, collect 
data, and provide lessons learned and recommendations to inform Navy suicide prevention efforts.  
C.  Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Branch (N172).  N172, previously N135S, will manage 
policy to prevent and respond to sexual assaults.  N172 will coordinate SAPR initiatives with Navy 
stakeholders on behalf of N1, Navy's SAPR executive agent.
D.  Sexual Harassment Prevention and Equal Opportunity Branch (N173).  N173, previously under N134, 
will manage policy for programs to prevent Sexual Harassment (N173A) and promote Equal Opportunity 
(N173B).   SAPR and Sexual Harassment will be more closely aligned to enhance cooperative efforts and 
integration of these programs to promote a positive command climate.
E.  Hazing Prevention Branch (N174).  N174, previously N137, will transition to N17 as the lead for Navy 
hazing policy and tracking of cases.

4.  Casualty, Mortuary and Prisoner of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) programs, previously N135C, 
are realigned under Commander, Navy Personnel Command (PERS-1).

5.  The realignment begins in June 2013 and will be completed prior to January 2014 to implement 
recommendations of reference (a).

6.  Establishment of the N17 Organization will provide for more coordinated and streamlined efforts in 
Sailor resiliency and readiness programs to support the men and women of our Navy.
