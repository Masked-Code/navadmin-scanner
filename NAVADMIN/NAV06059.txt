SUBJ/NAVY DIVERSITY STRATEGY//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  SITUATION.
    A.  CONSISTENT WITH THE STRATEGY FOR OUR PEOPLE, NAVY SEEKS TO
INSTITUTIONALIZE A CULTURE WHICH FULLY LEVERAGES AND VALUES OUR
DIVERSE WORKFORCE.  IN THIS PURSUIT, WE MUST DEVELOP A CAMPAIGN PLAN
TO COMPETE FOR THE WIDE RANGE OF TALENT OUR COUNTRY PRODUCES AND
CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH EVERY MAN AND WOMAN SERVING IN THE
NAVY CAN ACHIEVE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL.
    B.  THE NAVY NEEDS LEADERS FROM AND FOR EVERY PART OF OUR NAVY.
TODAY'S NAVY IS MANNED BY SAILORS AND CIVILIANS REPRESENTING
MULTIPLE ETHNIC GROUPS AND LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF CULTURAL HERITAGES.
IN LIGHT OF THIS DIVERSITY, WE MUST GIVE CAREFUL ATTENTION TO
RETAINING AND PROMOTING SAILORS WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL
TO BE EFFECTIVE WITHIN THIS LARGE ORGANIZATION COMPRISED OF
PERSONNEL FROM WIDELY VARYING ETHNIC AND CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS.  A
KEY MOTIVATION FOR THESE YOUNG, UPWARDLY MOBILE SAILORS IS TO BE
ABLE TO SEE THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN NAVYS SENIOR LEADERSHIP, IN
SUCH THINGS AS PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE, EDUCATION, AND WARFARE
COMMUNITY.

    C.  WHILE NAVY'S EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EFFORTS HAVE GENERALLY
ACHIEVED A DIVERSE WORKFORCE, THERE REMAIN OBSERVABLE DEMOGRAPHIC
SHORTFALLS IN SENIOR RANKS, TECHNICAL RATINGS AND ACROSS WARFARE
COMMUNITIES.  THIS LACK OF REPRESENTATION FAILS TO FULLY LEVERAGE
THE TOTAL FORCE AND THEREFORE RISKS NAVY'S FUTURE READINESS AS
AFFECTED BY ITS MANPOWER.
2.  MISSION.  ASSUMING WE HAVE RECRUITED THE WIDEST RANGE OF TALENT
OUR COUNTRY PRODUCES, NAVY WILL RETAIN AND PROMOTE A TOTAL FORCE
THAT FULLY LEVERAGES AND VALUES THE DIVERSITY INHERENT IN ITS
MAKEUP.  WE MUST DEVELOP LEADERS AND ROLE MODELS WHO REFLECT OUR
NAVY AND ESTABLISH ENDURING PROCESSES TO MAINTAIN THE DIVERSE TOTAL
FORCE.
3.  COMMANDER'S INTENT.
    A.  PURPOSE.  NAVY WILL CREATE A TOTAL FORCE THAT FULLY
LEVERAGES AND VALUES THE DIVERSITY INHERENT IN ITS MAKEUP.  WE WILL
DEVELOP LEADERS WHO REFLECT OUR NAVY, ITS ETHNIC MAKE UP, GENDER MIX
AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY.
    B.  METHOD.  NAVY WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS MISSION IN THREE PHASES.
PHASES 2 AND 3 MAY OCCUR CONCURRENTLY AND MAY BE SUSTAINED
THROUGHOUT ENDSTATE:


PAGE 05 RUENAAA0002 UNCLAS
- PHASE 1:  ASSESSMENT.  PHASE 1 WILL CONSIST OF A
BASELINE ASSESSMENT OF RECRUITMENT, RETENTION AND PROMOTION
GUIDELINES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN CURRENT TOTAL FORCE DEMOGRAPHICS,
AS WELL AS A REVIEW OF THE OVERALL DIVERSITY TOOLKIT, LEGAL
AUTHORITIES AND CONSTRAINTS.
- PHASE 2:  DECISIVE ACTION.  PHASE 2 WILL CONSIST OF
ESTABLISHING THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK TO OPTIMIZE NAVY'S DIVERSE
TOTAL FORCE, AS WELL AS CONDUCTING A FOCUSED ANALYSIS OF DEFICIENT
AREAS TO SUPPORT ROOT CAUSE DETERMINATIONS AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS.
EFFECTS BASED ASSESSMENTS WILL UNDERPIN PHASE 2 ACTIVITIES.
- PHASE 3:  SUSTAINMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY.  PHASE 3 WILL
CONSIST OF THE ENDURING ACTIONS TO MAINTAIN NAVY'S DIVERSE TOTAL
FORCE, INCLUDING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR BOTH MISSION SUCCESSES AND
FAILURES.
    C.  ENDSTATE.  HAVING CREATED AN INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK IN
WHICH EVERY MAN AND WOMAN SERVING THE NAVY CAN ACHIEVE THEIR FULL
POTENTIAL, NAVY WILL MAINTAIN ITS DIVERSE TOTAL FORCE THROUGH
ENDURING EFFECTS BASED ASSESSMENTS AND DISCRETE PHASE 2 AND/OR 3
LINES OF EFFORT, AS CALLED FOR.
4.  EXECUTION.
