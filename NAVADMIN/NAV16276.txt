SUBJ/CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS HOLIDAY MESSAGE// Rmks/1.  Team, Happy 
Holidays to you and your loved ones.  Dana and I hope that you find rest and 
renewal this season.  You are all valuable members of the Navy team and 
during this season of celebration, please spend some time celebrating with 
your family and friends.

2.  The Navy and Marine Corps is our nation's away team, and I'm particularly 
grateful for our Sailors and Marines standing the watch around the world this 
holiday season.  You will be celebrating in unique ways, with your Navy and 
Marine Corps family far from home and perhaps in dangerous places.  Your 
integrity, accountability, initiative, and toughness allow those of us here 
at home to enjoy a peaceful holiday season.

3.  As you celebrate, please remember to be safe and watch out for one 
another.  YOU are the most important part of our Navy, and the nation needs 
each of you to come back in the New Year rested and ready to perform at your 
best.  Thank you all for your hard work in 2016.  I look forward to another 
great year for our Navy and our nation in 2017.

4.  Happy Holidays!

5.  Released by ADM J. M. Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations.//
