RMKS/1.  On 1 January 2018, in order to provide a more modern and flexible 
retirement system for its members, the military services will transition to 
the Blended Retirement System (BRS) per reference (a).  In an effort to 
facilitate a smooth transition to BRS, all Navy Service Members will be 
required to complete either the BRS Leaders Training course or the BRS Opt-in 
Training course.

2.  Active component (AC) and reserve component (RC) members who join on or 
after 1 January 2018 will be automatically enrolled in BRS.  AC and RC 
members who joined before 1 January 2018 are automatically grandfathered into 
the current retirement system.  AC members with less than 12 years of service 
(YOS) as of 31 December
2017 or RC members in a paid status with less than 4,320 retirement points 
will have the choice of whether to stay with the current
retirement system or opt into BRS.   The election window for opt-in
eligible members will be open from 1 January 2018 until 31 December 2018.  If 
an opt-in eligible member enrolls in BRS, this election is irrevocable.  Opt-
in eligible members who do not choose to enroll in BRS during the election 
window will remain in the current retirement system.

3.  Unlike the current retirement system, which provides a retirement pension 
of 2.5 percent of base pay for every YOS, BRS provides automatic and 
government matching Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) contributions, a mid-career 
continuation pay (CP), and a retirement pension of 2.0 percent of base pay 
for every YOS.  Under BRS, members who leave the military before earning a 
retirement pension are permitted to keep the government TSP contributions if 
they have completed two YOS.  Additionally, BRS allows enrolled members who 
earn a retirement pension to choose to receive a portion of that pension in 
the form of a lump sum payment.

4.  To ensure that all members are properly informed on BRS, a series of 
training modules on Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) are being developed.  These 
modules are Leader Training to Introduce the Blended Retirement System, 
Blended Retirement System Financial Counselor/Educator Course, Blended 
Retirement System Opt-In Course, and Blended Retirement System New Accession 
Course.
Although each course targets distinct cohorts of the services, each of the 
courses will be available for viewing by all members.

5.  All Navy commands shall ensure that the training is completed and 
documented.  Command PASS Coordinators are tasked with ensuring that all 
command members have updated email addresses in Web NSIPS as announced in 
reference (b) to facilitate BRS eligibility notifications.  Command Career 
Counselors and Command Financial Specialists are tasked with ensuring they 
are knowledgeable on BRS and are able to inform members of the various 
resources available for members who wish to learn more about BRS.  If unable 
to complete via JKO or Navy e-learning due to connectivity issues, DVDs are 
available for order through the Defense Imagery Management Operations Center 
(DIMOC).  Order forms are located at 
http://www.dimoc.mil/customer/contact.html.  In the comments section of the 
order form, include the following: BRS Leader Training Course, Pin Number: 
505675, quantity, branch of service, and shipping address (include the name 
of who will be receiving the package).  These DVDs are provided at no cost to 
the requesting command.

6.  The first course, Leader Training to Introduce the Blended Retirement 
System,  provides a general overview of BRS and is required training for all 
Navy members who are grandfathered into the current system and are not 
eligible to opt-in to BRS (12 or more YOS or 4,320 or more points).  
Requiring members to take this course will ensure the entire Navy has a basic 
understanding of BRS.  The course is now available on JKO at 
http://jko.jten.mil/ (course #:
J3OP-US1330) and the Navy E-learning website at https://www.nel.navy.mil 
(course #: JKDDC-BRS-LTI-1.0).
Additionally, since this is an important financial decision that will affect 
a Service Members entire family, family members are encouraged to take the 
course via the Military One Source website at 
http://www.militaryonesource.mil/.

7.  The remaining modules are expected to be released over the coming months 
as follows:  The training course for personal financial counselors and 
educators Blended Retirement System Financial Counselor/Educator Course will 
be available October 2016 and will be required training for all personal 
financial managers, command career counselors and command financial 
specialists.  The training course for BRS opt-in eligible Service Members 
Blended Retirement System Opt-In Course is scheduled to be available January 
2017 and will be required training for all opt-in eligible Navy Service 
Members.  The training course for New Accessions Blended Retirement System 
New Accession Course will be available January 2018 and will be required 
training for all new accessions.
These courses will include web-based financial calculators to help members in 
their decision-making.  Additionally, there is a DoD supported website:
http://militarypay.defense.gov/blendedretirement/ that will be updated with 
the most recent BRS information.  Finally, trained financial counselors will 
be available at Fleet and Family Support Centers to help Sailors with the 
opt-in decision.

8.  The importance of the decision to enroll in BRS cannot be overstated as 
it has lifelong compensation implications and is likely the most important 
financial decision of an opt-in eligible members Navy career.  In addition to 
providing opt-in eligible members with the training, education and resources 
to make the right decision for their situation, it is vital that all members, 
even those not eligible to opt-in, have a working knowledge of BRS.
