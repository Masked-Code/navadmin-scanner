SUBJ/NAVY OPERATIONAL STRESS CONTROL TRAINING (CORRECTED COPY)//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES INFORMATION ON NAVY OPERATIONAL STRESS
CONTROL (OSC) TRAINING.  TO SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY'S 
VISION FOR THE 21ST CENTURY SAILOR AND MARINE, LEADERS MUST ACTIVELY 
FOSTER RESILIENCE, MANAGE STRESS PROBLEMS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, 
RECOGNIZE WHEN STRESS PROBLEMS HAVE OCCURRED, AND ELIMINATE THE STIGMA 
ASSOCIATED WITH GETTING HELP.  

2.  TO HELP COMBAT OPERATIONAL STRESS AMONG SAILORS, THE NAVY HAS 
CREATED OSC MOBILE TRAINING TEAMS (MTT) READY TO DELIVER "NAVY 
OSC-LEADER" AND "NAVY OSC FRONT LINE SUPERVISOR" TRAINING TO YOUR 
COMMAND.  THESE OSC TEAMS HAVE TAUGHT LEADERS, SAILORS, FAMILIES, AND 
COMMANDS ENHANCED SKILLS TO NAVIGATE THE PITFALLS OF AN OPERATIONALLY 
STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING AVOIDING NEGATIVE COPING MECHANISMS 
AND HIGH RISK BEHAVIORS, LIKE SUBSTANCE ABUSE.  OPERATIONAL STRESS IS 
A LEADERSHIP ISSUE THAT DIRECTLY IMPACTS OUR WARFIGHTING READINESS AND 
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR NAVY.  
    A.  THE OSC-LEADER COURSE IS AN INTERACTIVE, PROFESSIONALLY 
FACILITATED, SKILLS-BASED COURSE THAT FOCUSES ON STRESS MANAGEMENT 
TRAINING FOR OFFICERS AND CHIEF PETTY OFFICERS.  LEADERS LEARN HOW TO 
IDENTIFY STRESS, ACTIONABLE SKILLS TO HELP BUILD RESILIENCE, AND HOW 
TO MITIGATE STRESS BEFORE IT BECOMES STRESS INJURIES OR ILLNESSES.  AT 
THE END OF THE COURSE, A LEADER PANEL PROVIDES ATTENDEES A CHANCE TO 
HEAR FIRST-HAND FROM COMMAND LEADERS' PERSONAL STORIES WHICH 
DEMONSTRATE THAT NO ONE IS IMMUNE TO THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF STRESS.  
SAILORS WILL HEAR LEADERS TALK ABOUT REAL WORLD EXPERIENCES AND HOW 
THEY HANDLED THEM.  SAILORS WILL SEE AND LEARN FROM THEIR LEADERS THAT 
IT IS ABSOLUTELY "OK" TO SEEK HELP.
    B.  THE OSC FRONT LINE SUPERVISOR TRAINING PROVIDES IN-DEPTH 
TRAINING FOR DECK PLATE SUPERVISORS TO ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO 
RECOGNIZE AND EFFECTIVELY INTERVENE WITH SAILORS SUFFERING FROM 
EMOTIONAL DISTRESS CAUSED BY A VARIETY OF LIFE'S CHALLENGES.  IN 
ADDITION, THIS COURSE IS DESIGNED TO EFFECTIVELY MEET THE NEEDS OF 
SUPERVISORS, AND EMPHASIZES SUPERVISORY SKILLS AS MUCH AS HELPING 
SKILLS.  

3.  OSC MTT'S HAVE BEEN PRE-POSITIONED ON BOTH THE EAST AND WEST 
COASTS TO PROVIDE QUICK RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR NAVY OSC-LEADER 
AND FRONT LINE SUPERVISOR TRAINING.  THE SIX-HOUR OSC-LEADER COURSE 
IS DESIGNED FOR UNIT WARDROOMS AND THE CPO MESSES.  THE FOUR-HOUR 
FRONT LINE SUPERVISOR TRAINING FOCUSES ON HELPING THE E-6 TO 
O-3 DECKPLATE LEADER, DEVELOP SKILLS TO RECOGNIZE AND ADDRESS STRESS 
IN THEIR SAILORS.  

4.  COMMANDERS, COMMANDING OFFICERS, AND COMMAND MASTER CHIEFS SHOULD 
CONSIDER SCHEDULING THIS VALUABLE TRAINING FOR THEIR WARDROOMS AND 
MESSES PRIOR TO BEGINNING THE DEPLOYMENT WORK-UP PERIOD.
