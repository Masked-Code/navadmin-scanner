SUBJ/ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW POLICY FOR TUITION ASSISTANCE (TA)//

REF/B/DOC/DOD/15MAR11//
NARR/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1560.9A, VOLUNTARY EDUCATION FOR NAVY SAILORS.  REF B 
IS 
DOD INSTRUCTION 1322.25.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN MODIFIES POLICIES AS IMPLEMENTED IN REF A AND FURTHER 
DIRECTED BY REF B.

2.  NAVY LEADERSHIP REMAINS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES AND FINANCIAL 
ASSISTANCE TO SAILORS AS THEY PURSUE THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS.  HOWEVER, THE 
NEED 
FOR GREATER QUALITY CONTROL OF COURSES TAKEN BY OUR SERVICE MEMBERS AND THE 
FISCAL PRESSURE TO REDUCE SPENDING ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) 
REQUIRES IMPLEMENTATION OF ADDITIONAL POLICY CHANGE.  SAILORS PLANNING ON TA 
SUPPORTED EDUCATION SHOULD BE MADE AWARE OF RECENT CHANGES OUTLINED IN THIS 
NAVADMIN THAT INCLUDE A FUTURE REQUIREMENT FOR INSTITUTIONS TO HAVE A SIGNED 
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT WITH DOD IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR TA AND TA NO LONGER 
BEING AUTHORIZED FOR NEW PROGRAM STARTS ABOVE MASTER'S DEGREE LEVEL.
    A.  DOD MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU).  TO ENSURE ALL ACADEMIC 
INSTITUTIONS DELIVERING OFF-DUTY VOLUNTARY EDUCATION PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY 
EDUCATION AND ARE CONSISTENT BETWEEN THE SERVICES, EACH ACADEMIC INSTITUTION 
IS REQUIRED TO SIGN THE DOD MOU NOT LATER THAN 1 APRIL 2012.  ONLY THOSE 
INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE A SIGNED DOD MOU WILL BE AUTHORIZED TO SUBMIT TA 
FUNDING VOUCHERS FOR PAYMENT.  SAILORS WHO MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR TA 
AND SUBMIT A COMMAND APPROVED REQUEST PRIOR TO 1 APRIL 2012 FOR COURSES THAT 
BEGIN BETWEEN 1 APRIL 2012 AND 1 MAY 2012, WILL BE APPROVED FOR TA REGARDLESS 
OF THEIR INSTITUTION'S DOD MOU STATUS.  SAILORS WHO MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS 
FOR TA AND SUBMIT A COMMAND APPROVED REQUEST AFTER 1 APRIL 2012 WILL BE 
APPROVED FOR TA ONLY IF THEIR INSTITUTION HAS A SIGNED DOD MOU.  NCPACE 
COURSES ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THE DOD MOU REQUIREMENT.  AN ALPHABETICAL LIST OF 
INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE SIGNED THE DOD MOU CAN BE FOUND AT:  
HTTP://WWW.DODMOU.COM/ THEN CLICK ON THE "PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS" TAB.
    B.  FUNDING FOR GRADUATE DEGREES, CERTIFICATES AND LICENSES.  DOD ALLOWS 
SERVICES THE DISCRETION TO FUND DEGREE PROGRAMS ABOVE THE BACHELOR DEGREE 
LEVEL OR COURSES THAT LEAD TO THE AWARD OF A CERTIFICATE OR LICENSE.  NAVY 
WILL CONTINUE TO FUND UP THROUGH THE MASTER'S DEGREE LEVEL FOR BOTH OFFICERS 
AND ENLISTED PERSONNEL. EFFECTIVE 1 MARCH 2012, TA WILL NOT BE AUTHORIZED FOR 
NEW PROGRAM STARTS ABOVE THE MASTER'S DEGREE LEVEL.  SAILORS WHO ALREADY HAVE 
AN APPROVED EDUCATION PLAN AT THE DOCTORAL LEVEL DATED PRIOR TO THIS NAVADMIN 
WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE TA UNTIL THE DEGREE IS COMPLETE.  NAVY POLICY REMAINS 
UNCHANGED REGARDING THE PAYMENT FOR COURSES TAKEN TO EARN CERTIFICATES OR 
LICENSES.  ONLY THOSE COURSES TAKEN TO EARN A CERTIFICATE THAT ARE PART OF A 
SAILOR'S APPROVED EDUCATION PLAN WILL BE APPROVED FOR TA.  TA IS NOT 
AUTHORIZED TO FUND COURSES REQUIRED FOR A LICENSE.
    C.  REIMBURSEMENT FOR UNSUCCESSFUL COMPLETION.  REF B DIRECTS 
REIMBURSEMENT FOR COURSES WHEN STUDENTS DO NOT ACHIEVE A SATISFACTORY GRADE.  
A SATISFACTORY GRADE IS A "D" OR ABOVE FOR UNDERGRADUATE COURSES AND A "C" OR 
ABOVE FOR GRADUATE COURSES.  SAILORS WHO FAIL TO OBTAIN A SATISFACTORY GRADE 
ARE SUBJECT TO REIMBURSEMENT OF ANY RELATED TA FUNDS RECEIVED.
    D.  EDUCATION COUNSELING.  NAVY STRONGLY ENCOURAGES SAILORS TO DISCUSS 
OPTIONS WITH THE NAVY COLLEGE OFFICE OR VIRTUAL EDUCATION CENTER (VEC) 
COUNSELORS.  SAILORS WHO ATTEND SCHOOLS WHERE THE TUITION AND FEES EXCEED THE 
AUTHORIZED CAPS MAY USE MONTGOMERY OR POST-9/11 GI BILL.  SAILORS ARE ALSO 
ENCOURAGED TO ATTEND ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS THAT AWARD MAXIMUM CREDIT FOR 
MILITARY TRAINING, RATINGS AND NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATIONS AS EVALUATED BY 
AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATION.  THESE CREDITS, COUPLED WITH THE CREDIT BY EXAM 
PROGRAM OFFERED BY THE DEFENSE ACTIVITY FOR NON-TRADITIONAL EDUCATION SUPPORT 
(DANTES), AFFORD ELIGIBLE SAILORS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAXIMIZE NON-TRADITIONAL 
CREDITS AS THEY APPLY TO THEIR DEGREE PROGRAM.
    E.  TUITION AND FEES.  THE COMBINED CAP FOR TUITION AND FEES REMAINS AT 
$250 
PER SEMESTER HOUR FOR UP TO 16 SEMESTER HOURS OF COURSE WORK A YEAR.

    F.  ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF FUNDING.  SCHOLARSHIPS ARE AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE 
OF 
EDUCATIONAL FUNDING FOR OUR SAILORS.  MILITARY COMMUNITY SCHOLARSHIP AND 
FINANCIAL AID EXPLORER (SFEX), ACCESSED AT WWW.MCSFEX.NET IS OPEN TO ALL 
SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR DEPENDENTS.  SFEX PROVIDES A LISTING OF OVER 600 
SCHOLARSHIPS THAT ARE APPLICABLE FOR THE MILITARY AND THEIR DEPENDENTS.  THE 
PELL GRANT IS ALSO AVAILABLE TO QUALIFYING MILITARY AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.  
FREE APPLICATIONS MAY BE COMPLETED ON LINE AT WWW.FAFSA.ED.GOV.

3.  AMPLIFYING INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON THE NAVY COLLEGE WEBSITE AT 
HTTPS://WWW.NAVYCOLLEGE.NAVY.MIL/.  CONTACT YOUR LOCAL NAVY COLLEGE OFFICE OR 
VEC 
FOR ASSISTANCE WITH THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS.
