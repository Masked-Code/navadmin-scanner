RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces further measures to mitigate the spread of
COVID-19 throughout the Navy.  To protect the health and safety of our force 
and to support geographical diversity of our selection board members, all 
promotion, advancement, milestone and other selection boards scheduled to 
convene on or after 24 March 2020 at Navy Personnel Command (NPC) are 
postponed until further notice.  All affected board members and recorders 
with imminent travel requirements to support boards have been notified of 
this postponed.

2.  Upon resumption, we anticipate boards will generally follow the original 
selection board sequence.  As the COVID-19 situation evolves, NPC will refine 
the board schedule and promulgate additional guidance that ensures no 
eligible Sailor is disadvantaged by this action.  Schedule efficiencies may 
include conducting some smaller administrative boards via proven virtual 
processes.

3.  Enlisted Advancement Selection Boards, announced per references (a) and 
(b), policy is as follows:
    a.  Eligibility:
        (1) All eligibility requirements continue to apply.
        (2) All candidates eligible at the time of the boards original date
        remain eligible.
        (3) No additional candidates will be added to the eligibility list.
        (4) Members who have submitted voluntary Fleet Reserve (FLTRES)
        /retirement requests to NPC are not eligible.  Voluntary FLTRES are 
        those not mandated by high year tenure (HYT).
        (5) Per references (a) and (b), any loss of eligibility prior to 
        Board convening will result in the candidate being removed from the 
        eligibility list.
    b.  Letter to the board (LTB):
        (1) Submission deadlines remain as stated.
        (2) LTBs already received by NPC will remain on file for all 
         rescheduled boards.
    c.  Waiver requests due to rescheduled boards:  Active-Duty E7/E8/E9 and
    Reserve/FTS E7 Board eligible candidates with a HYT date between 1 July 
    2020 and 30 November 2020 may request a HYT waiver to 31 December 2020 to 
    remain selection board eligible.
    d.  Individual candidates may continue to view profile sheets via MyNavy
    Portal at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-advancement-center/my
    -advancement.

4.  Officer Promotion/Continuation Selection Boards, announced per references
(c) through (f), policy is as follows:
    a.  Eligibility:
        (1) All eligibility zones continue to apply.
        (2) All candidates eligible at the time of the boards original date
        remain eligible.
        (3) No additional candidates will be added to the eligibility list.
    b.  Letter to the Board (LTB):
        (1) Submission deadlines remain as stated.
        (2) LTBs already received by NPC will remain on file for all 
        rescheduled
        boards.

5.  Additional guidance and schedule details will be provided separate 
correspondence, as required.  I want to reassure every affected Sailor that 
we are committed to maintaining the sanctity of the selection board process 
and every precaution is being taken to ensure fairness and minimize impact to 
you and your family.

6.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled.

7.  Released by Vice Admiral John B. Nowell, Jr, N1.//
