RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the FY-17 Full Time Support 
(FTS) captain selective retention (SELRET) board.

2.  This SELRET board is designed to bring FTS inventory in line with 
authorized end strength, allow for reasonable promotion opportunity, and 
permit sufficient junior officer accessions to meet FTS officer operational 
requirements.  FTS officers subject to involuntary release from active-duty 
as a result of these boards will be retained on active duty, if necessary, to 
obtain eligibility for retirement with pay at 20 years active service.

3.  The FTS captain SELRET board will convene on 19 September 2016 to 
consider FTS captains in all competitive categories for retention.  This 
board will consider first gate FTS captains who were promoted during FY-15, 
and for second gate FTS captains who were promoted during FY-12.  Per 
reference (a), second gate FTS captains not selected for retention will 
retire or be released from active-duty no later than 1 September 2017.  Per 
reference (b), first gate FTS captains not selected for retention will retire 
or be released from active-duty no later than 1 September 2018.

4.  Amplifying information will be posted on the reserve personnel management 
and FTS community manager websites.  The authorized number of selections for 
retention will be posted as part of the board convening order on the board 
convening date.  The FTS officer community manager web page is:
