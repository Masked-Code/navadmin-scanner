RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and announces the renewal of 
Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Senior Enlisted and Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) 
Critical Skills Retention Bonus (CSRB) program.  The NSW CSRB is part of the 
overarching effort of the Navy to size, shape and stabilize the force.

2.  Program Overview.  This bonus is authorized under reference (b). Specific 
critical Navy enlisted classifications (NEC) and approved award levels have 
been prescribed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  Naval Special 
Warfare Enlisted Community Manager (BUPERS-324) will act as the NSW CSRB 
program manager.  All applications for this bonus will be submitted to the 
program manager for processing and tracking.  By law, a member may receive no 
more than 200,000 dollars in CSRB monies over a career.  Selective 
Reenlistment Bonus awards are not included in that cap.  The eligibility 
criteria stated in this NAVADMIN can be reduced at any time by the program 
manager based on the needs of the NSW community.

3.  Eligibility.  NSW enlisted members with NECs 532x or 535x, in paygrades 
E7 (select) and above, and CWOs with designators 7151 and 7171, who have

    a.  Members under an existing CSRB contract are not eligible to receive 
an additional CSRB for service outlined in original contract agreement.
    b.  Members are not eligible for CSRB payments past their High Year 
Tenure (HYT) date.  HYT dates are firm and HYT waiver requests will not be 
considered during the NSW CSRB application process.
    c.  Members with documented misconduct or below standard performance may 
be removed from CSRB eligibility.

5.  Contract Terms.  NSW CSRB contract lengths, payments and active-duty

        (4) CSRB Contract.  CSRB contract phases may be combined as long as 
the member is eligible to receive payments to the contracted end dates.
    b.  NSW CSRB contracts shall be for a minimum of two and maximum of six 
years.  Members under CSRB contract will not submit a request for retirement 
or tender a resignation with an effective date that is prior to completion of 
the agreement.  Enlisted members must reenlist or extend their enlistment 
contract, soft end of active obligated service, for a period of at least two 
years.  Members are authorized early reenlistment in order to align CSRB and 
reenlistment contracts.  Reenlistments and extensions may be combined to 
align service dates for maximum opportunity, up to a reenlistment of 6 years 
and extension of up to 12 months.

6.  Program Execution
    a.  Members should submit requests for NSW CSRB to the program manager 60 
to 180 days prior to entering into a NSW CSRB contract via their chain of 
command.  If operational commitments limit the ability to submit CSRB 
applications via this manner, commands should submit requests through their 
immediate superior in the chain of command who can submit the request to the 
program manager.
    b.  Upon acceptance of a members agreement by the program manager, the 
amount of the bonus becomes fixed and the member incurs a firm service 
obligation.
    c.  Service Members will receive the bonus in a lump sum payment, 
effective from the date of contract execution.
    d.  CSRB requests for personnel who are being processed for NEC removal 
or restoration will be held in abeyance pending final resolution.

7.  Payment Processing.  CSRB approval does not currently update the Defense 
Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) of the intent of the Sailor to reenlist.  
Until the DJMS can be programmed to accept CSRB reenlistment payments, manual 
processing is required.  Payment should post to the account of the member by 
the second pay period following the day the CSRB program manager receives 
notification of reenlistment or CWO letter of intent.  Master Military Pay 
Account (MMPA) must reflect contract or obligated service for enlisted 
members and tax-free status (if applicable) must post to MMPA for both 
enlisted and officers prior to final payment.

8.  Application.  The following documents are required:
    a.  60-180 days prior to contract:
        (1) letter of the member requesting a NSW CSRB contract.
        (2) COs endorsement letter.
    b.  Prior to payment members will submit a copy of reenlistment contract 
and/or extension agreement with proof of tax-free status, if applicable.

9.  Points of Contact
    a.  LCDR Justin Davis, Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) and Special Warfare 
Combatant-craft Crewmen (SWCC) Enlisted Community Manager, at (901) 874-
