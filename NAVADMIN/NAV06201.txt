2.  AS EXPECTED, COMPETITION FOR REDESIGNATION WAS KEEN AND EVERY
COMMUNITY HAD A POOL OF WELL QUALIFIED CANDIDATES TO CHOOSE FROM.
WITH 27 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL APPLICANT POOL RESTRICTED IN ACCESSION
BY QUOTA LIMITATIONS, MANY DECISIONS REQUIRED DETAILED RECORD
ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE AND EVALUATE KEY DISCRIMINATING TRAITS WITHIN
NEAR IMPECCABLE RECORDS.  THE BOARD NOTED THE FOLLOWING LESSONS
LEARNED FROM THESE DELIBERATIONS:
    A.  PERFORMANCE, PERFORMANCE, PERFORMANCE.  SUSTAINED SUPERIOR
PERFORMANCE AND RELEVANT EXPERIENCE ARE CRITICAL TO SELECTION.
    B.  SEEK SPONSORSHIP.  GAINING COMMUNITY ENDORSEMENT AND
EVIDENCE THAT CANDIDATES PROACTIVELY SOUGHT GAINING COMMUNITY
MENTORSHIP WERE CONSIDERED HIGHLY FAVORABLE ELEMENTS.  THESE
ELEMENTS SOMETIMES SERVED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TWO OTHERWISE
IDENTICAL RECORDS.
    C.  COMMUNICATE YOUR SELECTABILITY.  FAMILIARITY AND
UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMMUNITY YOU DESIRE REDESIGNATION TO SHOULD
ASSIST IN DEVELOPING A LOGICAL, RELEVANT RECORD FOR BOARD
EVALUATION.  BEYOND THE MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS, YOUR PACKAGE SHOULD
EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE EXPERIENCE, SKILLS, EDUCATION, AND SENIOR
SPONSORSHIP.  HAVING A MEMBER OF YOUR GAINING COMMUNITY REVIEW YOUR
PACKAGE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL.
    D.  CONSIDER ALL REDESIGNATION OPTIONS.  IF YOU HAVE NOT
CONSIDERED OR DOCUMENTED A SECONDARY COMMUNITY FOR REDESIGNATION,
YOU MISS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION AND SELECTION.
    E.  KEEP TRYING.  REDESIGNATION OPPORTUNITY IS DRIVEN BY THE
QUOTAS THAT BECOME AVAILABLE FROM BOARD TO BOARD.  THAT DEMAND
SIGNAL IS DYNAMIC AND CHANGES WITH EACH BOARD.  PERSISTENCE IS KEY.

3.  THIS MSG IS NOT AUTHORITY TO DELIVER CHANGE OF DESIGNATOR
LETTERS TO THE SELECTEE.
    A.  OFFICERS WHO ARE PROMOTION SELECTEES SHOULD CONTACT THEIR
CURRENT DETAILER TO DISCUSS REDESIGNATION TIMING.  UPON NOTIFICATION
BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) THAT SELECTEES HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE
TO THEIR NEW COMMUNITIES, COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-48) WILL FORWARD A
REDESIGNATION LTR, OR APPOINTMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF OATH (NAVPERS
1000/4) TO THE SELECTEE AS APPLICABLE.
    B.  OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT PROMOTION SELECTEES AND NOT UNDER
ORDERS CAN EXPECT ASSIGNMENT TO NEW BILLETS APPROPRIATE TO
THEIR NEW DESIGNATIONS WHEN NOTIFIED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4).
    C.  MEMBERS UNDER ORDERS WHO TRANSFER PRIOR TO NOTIFICATION BY
COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) MUST EXECUTE ORDERS UNDER CURRENT DESIGNATOR.
THESE MEMBERS MUST COMPLETE 12 MONTHS AT NEW ASSIGNMENT, UNLESS A
SHORTER TOUR IS PRESCRIBED PRIOR TO REDESIGNATION (TOURS IN EXCESS
OF ONE YEAR WILL BE WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE GAINING COMMUNITY).

4.  FOLLOWING ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE ABOVE:
    A.  SURFACE WARFARE (11XX) OFFICERS WHO ARE UNDER ORDERS TO
DEPARTMENT HEAD SCHOOL MAY NOT LATERALLY TRANSFER UNTIL COMPLETION
OF INITIAL DEPARTMENT HEAD TOUR.  ADDITIONALLY, THE FOLLOWING
OFFICERS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO TRANSFER/REDESIGNATE UNTIL WITHIN 1
YEAR OF SATISFYING THEIR RESPECTIVE OBLIGATION:
        -  OFFICERS WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR SURFACE WARFARE OFFICER
CONTINUATION PAY (SWOCP).
        -  OFFICERS WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR JUNIOR SURFACE WARFARE
OFFICER CRITICAL SKILLS RETENTION BONUS (JR SWO CSRB).
        -  OFFICERS OBLIGATED TO COMPLETE DEPARTMENT HEAD
ASSIGNMENTS DUE TO SELECTING DIVISION OFFICER SEQUENCE PLAN-B OR A
SWOCP OBLIGATED SHORE TOUR.
        -  OFFICERS WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR A SURFACE WARFARE OFFICER
CRITICAL SKILLS (SWOCS) BONUS.
    B.  AVIATION OFFICERS SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED TO LATERAL TRANSFER
UNTIL COMPLETION OF ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE OBLIGATION, EXPIRATION OF
AVIATION CAREER CONTINUATION PAY CONTRACT, OR PROJECTED ROTATION
DATE, WHICHEVER IS LATER.
    C.  ANY OFFICER PRESENTLY DESIGNATED 131X OR 132X WHO WAS
SELECTED FOR 151X MAY BE DELAYED REDESIGNATION UNTIL COMPLETION OF
APPLICABLE AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD AND/OR SECOND SEA TOUR AS
DETERMINED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-43).

5.  COMMANDING OFFICERS SHALL:
    A.  ENSURE OFFICERS SELECTED FOR PROMOTION WITHIN THEIR CURRENT
COMMUNITY DO NOT ACCEPT REDESIGNATION BEFORE THEIR PROMOTION DATE.
    B.  NOTIFY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4801G) NLT 15 AUG 06, BY MSG, OF
SELECTEES WHO DO NOT DESIRE TO ACCEPT TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION.

6.  THE NEXT TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION BOARD WILL CONVENE 30 OCT 06.
APPLICATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE 1 SEP 06 DEADLINE.
NON-SELECTEES FROM PAST BOARDS MUST SUBMIT NEW APPLICATIONS FOR
CONSIDERATION.  OPNAVINST 1210.5, AND MILPERSMAN ARTICLES 1212-010
AND 1212-030, SHOULD BE REVIEWED FOR ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND
APPLICATION PROCEDURES.  OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS AND MOST RECENT FITREP
ARE REQUIRED AS PART OF APPLICATION PACKAGES.
