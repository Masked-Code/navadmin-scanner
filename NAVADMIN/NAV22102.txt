RMKS/1.  Purpose.  To provide additional guidance regarding the actions 
directed in references (a) through (h) for Navy service members who requested 
religious accommodation from the COVID-19 vaccination requirement.  These 
service members were certified by the U.S. District Court order in reference 
(i) as members of a class action in the case of U.S. Navy SEALS 1-26, et al., 
versus Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin, III, et al.  This message 
supersedes and replaces guidance previously provided in reference (j). 
 
2.  Policy.  To ensure compliance with the court order in reference (i), this 
NAVADMIN continues to suspend separation processing and certain adverse 
administrative consequences of COVID-19 vaccine refusal for Navy service 
members who submitted requests for religious accommodation from the COVID-19 
vaccine requirement.  In line with a recent decision of the U.S. Supreme 
Court, the Navy may continue to consider the unvaccinated status of Navy 
service members when making deployment, assignment, and other operational 
decisions. 
 
3.  Applicability.  This NAVADMIN applies only to Navy service members who 
have submitted requests for religious accommodation from the COVID-19 vaccine 
requirement in line with references (k) and (l).  Adverse administrative 
consequences and separation processing described in references (a) through 
(h) continue to apply for personnel who have not submitted requests for 
religious accommodation. 
 
4.  Action 
 
4.a.  Navy service members with approved or pending COVID-19 vaccination 
religious accommodation requests or appeals have not refused the vaccine as 
defined in references (b) and (c).  As such, these service members shall not 
be processed for separation or be subject to adverse actions as outlined in 
references (a) through (h). 
 
4.b.  The following applies only to Navy service members whose request for 
religious accommodation from the COVID-19 vaccine requirement has been denied 
or disapproved on appeal. 
 
4.b.1.  Separation Processing. 
 
4.b.1.a.  Involuntary Separation Processing.  Officer and enlisted 
involuntary separation processing is suspended.  Reports of misconduct not 
already complete shall not be forwarded.  In cases where commands have 
received formal direction to involuntarily separate members within ten days 
based on misconduct (vaccine refusal) and those members have not yet 
separated, DD-214s shall not be issued and members are directed to remain on 
active duty, pending additional guidance.  Commands must communicate with the 
servicing Personnel Support Detachment or equivalent in order to halt 
processing.  Additionally, commands shall inform Navy Personnel Command PERS-
832 (enlisted), PERS-834 (officers), or PERS-913 (SELRES) in cases where 
service members awaiting separation still desire to separate. 
 
4.b.1.b.  Voluntary Separation.  Voluntary resignation, retirement, or 
regular service expiration (EAOS) may continue.  Members who submitted 
requests for religious accommodation may cancel or amend previous voluntary 
retirement requests or requests to transfer to the Fleet Reserve.  Time is of 
the essence for updated requests.  Members who previously submitted a 
voluntary resignation or retirement for 1 June 2022 or earlier who no longer 
wish to retire or resign must submit cancellation requests through NSIPS for 
final adjudication.  In order to expedite processing, members and commands 
are directed to include "Cancellation of retirement or resignation request 
due to Religious Accommodation submission" in their corresponding NSIPS 
requests. 
 
4.b.1.c.  Other Involuntary Separation Bases.  In cases involving a basis for 
involuntary separation other than COVID-19 vaccine refusal, separation 
processing shall continue on that distinct basis.  The CCDA is no longer the 
enlisted separation authority for such separations.  Determine separation 
authority per reference (m) and re-notify as required. 
 
4.b.2.  Fitness Reports and Evaluations.  No new adverse fitness reports and 
enlisted evaluations relating to COVID-19 vaccine refusal shall be prepared 
or issued.  Unexecuted (i.e. not transmitted to NPC) adverse fitness reports 
and enlisted evaluations relating to COVID-19 vaccine refusal should be 
discarded.  Previously submitted adverse fitness reports and evaluations will 
not be considered adverse, and will be removed from permanent records until 
otherwise directed. 
 
4.b.3.  Bonus, Special Pays, and Incentive Pays.  Bonuses, special pays and 
incentive pays are considered unearned for personnel who have been removed 
from assignment based on deployment and other operational decisions.   
Reference (c) provides guidance on required actions for members with unearned 
bonuses, special pays and incentives. 
 
4.b.4.  Education and SkillBridge.  Disqualification for educational benefits 
and SkillBridge participation is suspended. 
 
4.b.5.  Reenlistment and Extensions.  Reenlistments and extensions are 
authorized.  Effective immediately, Sailors previously denied reenlistment or 
extension opportunities due to CCDA policy contained in references (c) and 
(d) are authorized to reenlist or extend, so long as they remain retention 
eligible in all other respects as outlined in reference (o).  Commands can 
use this NAVADMIN as authority to allow members to extend for a reasonable 
time if required to suspend separation processing.  Per reference (p), 
members are reminded all eligibility requirements for Selective Reenlistment 
Bonuses (SRB) must be met, including a minimum 3-year reenlistment. 
 
4.b.6.  Promotion, Advancement, and Frocking.  Promotion, advancement and 
frocking are authorized if existing promotion/advancement authority is in 
effect. 
 
4.b.6.a.  Withheld or Delayed Officer Promotions.  Promotion recommendations 
will be routed for SECNAV determination in line with SECNAVINST 1420.3 or 
1412.6M, as applicable. 
 
4.b.6.b.  Withdrawn or Withheld Enlisted Advancements.  Enlisted Sailors will 
be eligible for the next advancement cycle or board.  Promotion, advancement 
and frocking are authorized if existing promotion/advancement authority is in 
effect. 
 
4.b.7.  Warfare Qualifications, Additional Qualification Designators (AQDs), 
and Navy Enlisted Classifications.  The warfare qualifications, AQDs, NECs, 
and sub-specialties of Navy service members are important considerations when 
making deployment, assignment, and other operational decisions involving 
those members.  Community sponsor flag officers remain authorized to consider 
the unvaccinated status of a Navy service member when deciding to award or 
remove a warfare qualification, AQD, NEC, or sub-specialty.  Any decision to 
award or remove a warfare qualification, AQD, NEC, or sub-specialty should 
consider the impact of the members unvaccinated status on performing the 
mission and duties associated with the warfare qualification, AQD, NEC, or 
sub-specialty, and should remain consistent with current community policies 
and normal practices for Navy service members who do not maintain 
deployability or individual readiness.  These decisions must remain 
administrative rather than punitive. 
 
4.b.8.  Detachment for Cause.  Detachment for cause for COVID-19 vaccine 
refusal is not authorized.  Reassignment decisions, including decisions to 
relieve members of their assigned duties, remain an operational decision 
subject to the discretion of the cognizant commander.  Previously executed 
detachments for cause will not be considered adverse at this time, will be 
removed from permanent records until otherwise directed, and shall not be 
commented on in subsequent fitness reports or evaluations. 
 
4.b.9.  Reserve Affiliation.  Navy service members otherwise separating from 
active service may apply for affiliation with the Reserve Component. 
 
5.  Transfer and Assignment.  The Navy will continue to consider the 
unvaccinated status of Navy service members when making deployment, 
assignment, and other operational decisions.  Reference (n) (series), 
regarding the assignment of unvaccinated personnel to operational or 
deployable units, continues to apply. 
 
6.  Screening Testing.  All unvaccinated Navy service members remain subject 
to screening testing against COVID-19, where required. 
 
7.  Reporting.  Database reporting in line with reference (q) continues to 
apply.  Commanders are directed to continue updating the CCDA database with 
the appropriate entry each time there is a change in vaccination status. 
 
8.  Accommodation Request Receipt.  In the case of all previously submitted 
religious accommodation requests, if a command did not receive confirmation 
of receipt from OPNAV N131, send an email with the members identifying 
information to the Religious Accommodations Program Manager at 
ALTN_Navy_Religious_Accommodations(at)navy.mil. 
 
9.  If in doubt as to how to adjudicate issues related to this guidance, 
Commanders should seek guidance from their chain of command, their staff 
judge advocate, and/or the CCDA before acting.  Commands without an assigned 
legal advisor may seek legal advice from a Region Legal Service Office.  In 
all cases, Commanders are accountable to ensure the health and safety of 
their command while treating every Navy service member with dignity and 
respect.
