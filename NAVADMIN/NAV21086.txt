NARR/ REF A IS CNO GUIDANCE TO COMMANDERS ON ADJUSTING HEALTH PROTECTION 
CONDITIONS AND BASE SERVICES.
REF B IS OUSD PR GUIDANCE FOR COMMANDERS RISK-BASED RESPONSES AND 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEALTH PROTECTION CONDITION FRAMEWORK DURING 
CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019.
REF C IS OPNAV OCCUPANCY EXEMPTIONS AUTHORIZATION.
REF D IS OPNAV PREVENTION FRAMEWORK.
REF E IS ALNAV 029-20 STATE AND LOCAL SHELTER-IN-PLACE ORDERS IMPACT ON 
DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY OPERATIONS.
REF F IS SECNAV MEMO DELEGATING AUTHORITIES AND AMPLIFYING HPCON GUIDANCE.

RMKS/1.  REFERENCES (A) AND (D) ARE CANCELLED.  THIS NAVADMIN INTRODUCES THE 
COVID-SPECIFIC DOD-DIRECTED HEALTH PROTECTION CONDITION (HPCON) FRAMEWORK 
OUTLINED IN REF (B); IDENTIFIES HPCON IMPLEMENTATION GOVERNANCE; IDENTIFIES 
CRITERIA AND OCCUPANCY LIMITATIONS ALIGNED WITH HPCON LEVELS PER REF (B); 
AND, PROVIDES NAVY EXEMPTION PROCESS FOR OCCUPANCY LEVELS.  THIS IS A 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM REF (A).
NAVY COMPONENT COMMANDERS (NCC) WILL USE TABLE 1 OF REF (B), ALONG WITH 
GUIDANCE SET FORTH IN REF (B) TO SET HPCON LEVELS, TRANSITION BETWEEN HPCON 
LEVELS AND DIRECT ACTIVITIES ACROSS HPCON LEVELS TO PROTECT THE FORCE AND 
PROVIDE MISSION ASSURANCE.

2.  MISSION.  HPCON IS AN AGILE FRAMEWORK ENABLING MISSION ASSURANCE WHILE 
PROTECTING PERSONNEL.  DECISIONS TO CHANGE HPCON WILL BE BASED ON LOCAL 
PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILLANCE DATA; GUIDANCE FROM THE CDC OR FROM HOST NATION 
EQUIVALENT IF OCONUS; COLLABORATION WITH STATE, TERRITORIAL, AND LOCAL PUBLIC 
HEALTH AND MEDICAL AUTHORITIES; COORDINATION BETWEEN NEARBY INSTALLATIONS; 
AND ADVICE FROM THE COMMAND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OFFICER
(PHEO) AND LOCAL MILITARY MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITY (MTF).

2.A.  THOSE WITH HPCON IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORITY WILL COORDINATE CHANGES IN 
HPCON LEVELS WITH OTHER MILITARY INSTALLATIONS IN THE SAME LOCAL COMMUTING 
AREA (E.G., APPROXIMATELY 30 MILES) TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO 
ENSURE CONSISTENCY IN RESPONSE AND CONSISTENT DOD UNITY OF MESSAGING IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH REF (B) AND AMPLIFIED IN REF (F).  ASSESSMENTS MUST INCLUDE 
BOTH THE INSTALLATION AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITY.  RESOURCES TO ASSESS 
COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION RATES AND CORRESPONDING HPCON LEVELS ARE IDENTIFIED IN 
REF (B).  NCCS WILL COORDINATE HPCON CHANGES WITH COMBATANT COMMANDERS AND/OR 
SUB-UNIFIED COMMANDERS AS NEEDED.  COMMANDER, NAVAL INSTALLATIONS COMMAND 
(CNIC) AND REGIONAL COMMANDERS (REGCOM) WILL GAIN APPROVAL FROM THE 
RESPECTIVE NCC TO ADJUST HPCON.  NCC MAY DELEGATE AUTHORITY TO CHANGE HPCON 
TO THE REGION OR INSTALLATION COMMANDER, BUT MAY NOT DELEGATE TO A LEVEL 
LOWER THAN THE O-6 INSTALLATION COMMANDER.

2.B.  EXTENSIVE DATA IS AVAILABLE TO INFORM THE HPCON REVIEW PROCESS VIA THE 
ADVANA COVID-19 MODELING PLATFORM.  ADVANA ACCOUNTS AND ACCESS CAN BE FOUND 
AT:  HTTPS://QLIK.ADVANA.DATA.MIL/.  NCC, FLEET AND INSTALLATION COMMANDERS 
CAN USE THIS PLATFORM TO ACCURATELY DEVELOP A COVID-19 COMMON OPERATIONAL 
PICTURE TO ENABLE DATA-INFORMED DECISION MAKING.  THE ADVANA SYSTEM INCLUDES 
LIVE DATA UPDATES ON CASES, TESTING CAPACITY, BEDS, PERSONNEL, SUPPLY AND 
LOGISTICS, GIVING COMMANDERS REAL-TIME SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WHILE PROJECTING 
IMPACTS TO READINESS.  NCC, OR DELEGATED AUTHORITY, WILL USE THIS HPCON 
TRANSITION FRAMEWORK TO INFORM DECISIONS THAT BALANCE OPERATIONAL READINESS, 
MAINTENANCE, TRAINING, EDUCATION AND THE NEEDS OF INSTALLATION BENEFICIARY 
POPULATIONS.  NCC SHOULD CONSIDER TRANSMISSION RATES, DISEASE TRAJECTORY AND 
MEDICAL FACILITY CAPABILITIES/CAPACITIES IN CHANGING HPCON LEVELS.  CASE-RATE 
THRESHOLDS SHOULD NOT BE THE SOLE DETERMINING FACTOR FOR AN INSTALLATIONS 
HPCON LEVEL.  CASE-RATES SERVE AS GUIDELINES FOR INTEGRATION INTO A 
COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW PROCESS PER REF (B).  ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENT MEASURES MAY 
INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:  (1) SHORT TERM COVID-19 TRAJECTORY CHANGES 
IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY; (2) ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS OF UNREPORTED
COVID-19 (I.E., DETECTED IN WASTEWATER); AND, (3) SUPPORTING MEDICAL CAPACITY 
AND CAPABILITY.  REF (B) TABLE 1 PROVIDES CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHANGING HPCON 
LEVELS.

2.C.  MEASURES LISTED IN TABLE 1 OF REF (B) WILL BE CONSIDERED AND MAY BE 
ADJUSTED AT EACH HPCON LEVEL BASED ON MISSION AND OTHER RISK CONSIDERATIONS, 
AND IN CONSULTATION WITH MILITARY PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL ADVISORS, TO THE 
EXTENT CONSISTENT WITH OVERARCHING DOD FHP GUIDANCE.
DIRECTIVE MEASURES IDENTIFIED IN TABLE 1 OF REF (B) SHALL BE IMPLEMENTED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH CORRESPONDING HPCON LEVELS. SUGGESTED MEASURES (CONSIDER, 
ENCOURAGE, ETC.) IDENTIFIED IN TABLE 1 OF REF (B) ARE PROVIDED TO MANAGE 
INSTALLATION ACCESS AND SERVICES AND INFORM AUTHORIZED AND PROHIBITED 
ACTIVITIES OFF-INSTALLATION COMMENSURATE WITH THE APPROPRIATE HPCON LEVEL.  
NCCS MAY MODIFY HEALTH PROTECTION MEASURES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE MISSION 
ASSURANCE WHILE ENSURING FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION.  INSTALLATION COMMANDERS 
SHOULD CONSIDER THE MERITS (WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THEIR AUTHORIZATION) OF 
PROVIDING PERSONNEL ACCESS TO CONTROLLED, ON-BASE FACILITIES OVER 
UNCONTROLLED OFF-BASE FACILITIES WHEN DETERMINING SERVICES TO PROVIDE AS PART 
OF THE HPCON RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN.

3.  HPCON LEVELS.  THE CRITERIA OUTLINED IN THIS NAVADMIN USE COMMUNITY 
TRANSMISSION RATES AS AN ANALYTICAL FOUNDATION FOR ASSESSMENT BY LOCAL 
COMMANDERS.  CASE-RATE THRESHOLDS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED THE EXCLUSIVE 
FACTOR FOR DETERMINING HPCON LEVELS.  NCC, OR DELEGATED AUTHORITY, SHOULD USE 
THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA WHEN CONSIDERING A CHANGE TO HPCON LEVELS:

3.A. HPCON D:  WIDESPREAD COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION. DAILY AVERAGE OF MORE THAN 
60 NEW CASES PER 100,000 POPULATION IN THE LAST 7 DAYS AND NO DECLINE IN 
CASES OR A DECLINE OF NEW CASES OF LESS THAN 7 DAYS.

3.B. HPCON C: SUSTAINED COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION.  DAILY AVERAGE OF 31-60 NEW 
CASES PER 100,000 POPULATION IN THE LAST 7 DAYS.

3.C. HPCON B+: ELEVATED COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION.  DAILY AVERAGE OF 16-30 NEW 
CASES PER 100,000 POPULATION IN THE LAST 7 DAYS.

3.D. HPCON B: INCREASED COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION.  DAILY AVERAGE OF 2-15 NEW 
CASES PER 100,000 POPULATION IN THE LAST 7 DAYS.

3.E. HPCON A: MINIMAL COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION.  DAILY AVERAGE OF FEWER THAN 2 
NEW CASES PER 100,000 POPULATION IN THE LAST 7 DAYS.

3.F. HPCON 0: COVID-19 GLOBAL PANDEMIC DECLARATION RESCINDED.  RETURN TO 
NORMAL OPERATIONS CRITERIA WILL BE ADDRESSED IN UPDATES TO FHP SUPPLEMENTS.
NOTE 1:  DUE TO VARIATIONS IN LOCALLY AVAILABLE COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION CASE 
RATES, PERIODICITY SHOULD BE BASED ON AVAILABLE DATA (E.G., 14 VICE 7 DAYS, 
EXTRAPOLATING CRITERIA AS APPROPRIATE, I.E. A DAILY AVERAGE OF 31-60 NEW 
CASES PER DAY PER 100,000 POPULATION IS EQUIVALENT TO 210-420 NEW CASES PER 
WEEK).
NOTE 2:  HOST NATION AND LOCAL REQUIREMENTS MAY NECESSITATE USE OF A 
DIFFERENT PERIOD FOR CASE RATE (E.G., 7- OR 14-DAY COMPARISON).
NOTE 3:  DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY OF DOCUMENTED COVID-19 CASES OR OF POSITIVE 
TESTS AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL TESTS OVER THE PRECEDING 7-DAY PERIOD SUPPORT A 
DECISION TO REDUCE HPCON TO THE NEXT LOWER LEVEL; LIKEWISE, UPWARD 
TRAJECTORIES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO INCREASE HPCON 
LEVELS.

4.  OCCUPANCY.  REF (B) LIMITS THE NUMBER OF PERSONNEL IN THE WORKPLACE BY 
MAXIMIZING REMOTE WORK, FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING, AND OTHER METHODS, SYNCHRONIZED 
WITH THE HPCON LEVEL.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH REF (B), OCCUPANCY RATES WILL BE 
CALCULATED BY COMPARING THE CURRENT DAILY IN-PERSON CENSUS WITH THE ASSIGNED 
BASELINE STRENGTH FOR THE INSTALLATION/FACILITY.  REF (B) ENCOURAGES 
COMMANDERS TO CONSIDER ADDITIONAL FACTORS INCLUDING OVERALL 
FACILITY/WORKSPACE SIZE, THE ABILITY TO SOCIAL DISTANCE, AND THE MOST 
CURRENT, APPLICABLE CDC GUIDANCE.
EACH COMMANDER SHOULD ASSESS THEIR SPECIFIC SITUATION AND CONSIDER ALL 
FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE OCCUPANCY RATE NEEDED TO PROVIDE 
MISSION ASSURANCE WHILE PROTECTING OUR FORCE AND MINIMIZING INFECTION SPREAD.  
IN CASES WHERE REQUIRED OCCUPANCY FOR MISSION SUCCESS EXCEEDS THE LIMITS IN 
REF (B), THE EXEMPTION PROCESS DESCRIBED BELOW SHOULD BE USED TO REQUEST 
OCCUPANCY LEVELS GREATER THAN AUTHORIZED BY REF (B).  COMMANDERS SHALL NOT 
REDUCE OCCUPANCY SUCH THAT CRITICAL NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS ARE 
JEOPARDIZED.

4.A. DIRECTED OCCUPANCY RATES FOR HPCON LEVELS ARE:

4.A.1. HPCON A:  LESS THAN 100% OF NORMAL OCCUPANCY IN THE WORKPLACE.

4.A.2. HPCON B:  LESS THAN 50% OF NORMAL OCCUPANCY IN THE WORKPLACE.

4.A.3. HPCON B+:  LESS THAN 40% OF NORMAL OCCUPANCY IN THE WORKPLACE.

4.A.4. HPCON C:  LESS THAN 25% OF NORMAL OCCUPANCY IN THE WORKPLACE.

4.A.5. HPCON D:  LESS THAN 15% OF NORMAL OCCUPANCY IN THE WORKPLACE.
NOTE:  WHEN DETERMINING WORKFORCE OCCUPANCY LIMITS, COMMANDERS ARE ENCOURAGED 
TO CONSIDER A RANGE OF FACTORS THEY DETERMINE ARE RELEVANT, INCLUDING 
FACILITY SIZE, MITIGATION MEASURES SUCH AS PHYSICAL BARRIERS, THE ABILITY TO 
SOCIAL DISTANCE, AND THE MOST CURRENT CDC GUIDANCE.  THE OVERALL GOAL IS TO 
PROTECT OUR FORCE BY MINIMIZING THE CHANCE OF INFECTION SPREAD WHILE 
PRESERVING MISSION ASSURANCE.

4.B.  OCCUPANCY LIMIT EXEMPTIONS.  OCCUPANCY EXEMPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE AS 
DESCRIBED IN REF (B).  UNIT COMMANDERS ARE REQUIRED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE 
HEALTH PROTECTION MEASURES REMAIN IN PLACE WHILE OPERATING UNDER OCCUPANCY 
EXEMPTIONS.  UNITS WITH AN EXEMPTION ALLOWING HIGHER OCCUPANCY LEVELS THAN 
PARA 4A OF THIS NAVADMIN ARE EXPECTED TO MEET MISSION REQUIREMENTS AND 
PROTECT PERSONNEL THROUGH RIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING HEALTH PROTECTION 
MEASURES.

4.B.1.  EXEMPTIONS.  PER REF (C), THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN GRANTED 
EXEMPTIONS FROM THE OCCUPANCY RATES PROMULGATED IN REF (B):  MEDICAL 
TREATMENT FACILITIES AND EXPEDITIONARY MEDICAL FACILITIES,  NAVY INSTALLATION 
FIRST RESPONDER UNITS, FORCES SUPPORTING CRITICAL NATIONAL CAPABILITIES, NAVY 
OPERATIONAL UNITS, COMMAND HEADQUARTERS, SHIPYARDS, FLEET READINESS CENTERS, 
AND UNITS PROVIDING ESSENTIAL MISSION SUPPORT.

4.B.2.  ADDITIONAL EXEMPTIONS.  AUTHORITY TO GRANT ADDITIONAL OCCUPANCY 
EXEMPTIONS IS DELEGATED TO THE RESPONSIBLE NCC, WITH FURTHER DELEGATION 
AUTHORIZED IN WRITING TO A LEVEL NO LOWER THAN A GENERAL/FLAG OFFICER IN THE 
GRADE OF O-7, SENIOR EXECUTIVE SERVICE MEMBER (OR EQUIVALENT).  A RECORD OF 
ALL OCCUPANCY EXEMPTIONS WILL BE RETAINED BY THE EXEMPTION AUTHORITY AND 
PROVIDED TO THE INSTALLATION COMMANDER AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE.

5.  ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

5.A.  LOCAL, COUNTY, AND STATE REGULATIONS AND DIRECTIVES.  IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH REF (E), IF NECESSARY TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF CRITICAL FUNCTIONS, 
FEDERAL LAW EXEMPTS MILITARY AND FEDERAL CIVILIAN PERSONNEL FROM STATE AND 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ORDERS WHEN PERFORMING OFFICIAL DUTIES.

5.B.  HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS.  WHEN IMPLEMENTING AN OCCUPANCY EXEMPTION, 
COMMANDERS SHALL GIVE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO SELF-IDENTIFY AS BEING HIGH RISK 
TO ADVERSE OUTCOMES IF INFECTED BY COVID-19, AND WHO HAVE NOT BEEN IMMUNIZED 
THROUGH VACCINATION, THE LATITUDE TO TELEWORK UNTIL REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS 
ARE PROVIDED.  COMMANDERS MAY DIRECT ANY EMPLOYEE TO RETURN TO THE WORKSITE 
TO PERFORM FUNCTIONS OF THEIR JOB PROVIDED THERE IS LEGITIMATE BUSINESS THAT 
CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY PERFORMED VIA TELEWORK.
SUCH DIRECTION MAY INITIATE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCEDURES.

5.C.  TESTING AND RESTRICTION OF MOVEMENT PLANS.  CONCURRENT WITH ANY HPCON 
CHANGE, COMMANDERS SHOULD HAVE ESTABLISHED PLANS AND READY CAPACITY TO 
CONDUCT COVID-19 TESTING, CONTACT TRACING, AND RESTRICTION OF MOVEMENT OF 
THOSE INDIVIDUALS RETURNING FROM HIGH-EXPOSURE LOCATIONS, EXHIBITING 
SYMPTOMS, OR THOSE EXPOSED TO POSITIVE COVID-19 CASES.

5.D.  SENTINEL SURVEILLANCE TESTING AND MONITORING PROGRAMS.  IN CONSULTATION 
WITH PHEOS AND LOCAL MTFS, INSTALLATION COMMANDERS WILL ENSURE SENTINEL 
SURVEILLANCE TESTING PROGRAMS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT DOD REQUIREMENTS 
TO HELP INFORM HPCON LEVEL CHANGES.  MONITORING PROGRAMS SUCH AS WASTEWATER 
DIAGNOSTICS WILL ASSIST IN ASSESSING FORCE HEALTH.

5.E.  LESSONS LEARNED.  EACH COMPONENT SHOULD UPDATE LESSONS LEARNED IN THE 
JOINT LESSONS LEARNED INFORMATION SYSTEM (HTTPS://WWW.JLLIS.MIL).

6.  COMMANDERS ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE A RISK-INFORMED APPROACH, AND ALL HANDS 
ARE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW HEALTH PROTECTION MEASURES TO ACCOMPLISH THE MISSION 
WHILE PROTECTING THE FORCE.  THESE CONCEPTS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND 
OUR FORCE HAS SHOWN RESILIENCE IN A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT, COMBATING
COVID-19 WHILE CONTINUING OUR GLOBAL MISSION. THROUGH AN ALL-HANDS EFFORT 
EMPHASIZING PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY, WE CAN BEGIN OUR RETURN TO NORMAL 
OPERATIONS WHILE MANAGING THE PERSISTENT RISK COVID-19 PRESENTS TO BOTH OUR 
MISSION AND FORCE.

7.  RELEASED BY VADM P. G. SAWYER, DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS FOR 
OPERATIONS, PLANS AND STRATEGY.//
