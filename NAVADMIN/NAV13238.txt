RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the schedule for Advancement Examination 
Readiness Reviews (AERR) from October 2013 to March 2014.  
The reviews are held at Naval Education and Training Professional Development 
and Technology Center (NETPDTC) on board Saufley Field, Pensacola, FL.  Per 
ref (a), this NAVADMIN supersedes ref (b) and should be read in its entirety.

2.  Temporary Additional Duty (TAD) travel in support of AERR is considered 
mission critical and is Flag-Approved.

3.  Chief, senior chief, and master chief petty officers on active duty, full 
time support (FTS), and reservists on active duty for special work (ADSW) are 
requested to volunteer for the AERR and serve as subject matter experts 
(SMES) in their respective ratings.  These reviews are designed to use TAD 
SMES, provided by fleet and shore-based commands, to assist with the review 
and development of rating advancement examinations.  All costs pertaining to 
TAD are completely funded by NETPDTC with no additional cost to the 
attendee's parent command.

4.  Every chief should view this solicitation as an opportunity to contribute 
to the development of our 21st Century leaders.  Nominations must be routed 
through, and endorsed by, the commanding officer/officer in charge and 
command master chief/senior chief/chief of the boat and submitted to the 
NETPDTC point of contact.  Depending on the Navy Advancement Center's needs, 
three to six nominees will be selected for each AERR.  The application form
