        (3) DETACHING MEMBERS SHALL PRE-REGISTER WITH THE IRR PRIOR TO

VOLUNTARY BASIS, IT REMAINS SECNAV S LEGAL AUTHORITY (REF P) TO 
MOBILIZE ANY MEMBER OF A RESERVE COMPONENT (INCLUDING THE IRR) WITHOUT 
THE CONSENT OF THE MEMBER AFFECTED.
7.  CNP COMMENTS:  I CANNOT STATE IT ANY PLAINER THAN THIS.
SATISFACTORY PARTICIPATION IN THE ANNUAL REPORTING PROGRAM FOR MEMBERS 
OF THE IRR IS THE LAW AND IT IS REQUIRED OF NAVY MEMBERS IN THE IRR, 
PERIOD.  WE ALL NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB AT GETTING THE WORD OUT AND 
KEEPING OUR IRR MEMBERS FULLY ENGAGED.  ANNUAL MUSTERS NOT ONLY AFFORD 
US THE OPPORTUNITY TO COLLECT REQUIRED INFORMATION BUT ALSO ALLOWS OUR 
FTS AND SELRES AT THE NOSC S TO REMIND IRR MEMBERS THAT THERE ARE A LOT 
OF OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO THEM THROUGH EITHER MORE ACTIVE IRR 
PARTICIPATION, AFFILIATION WITH THE SELRES OR VOLUNTEERING TO MOBILIZE 
IN SUPPORT OF THE GWOT IN AN IA STATUS.  IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, WE 
HAVE IDENTIFIED 272 IRR MEMBERS WHO HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO MOBILIZE WITH 
ANOTHER 82 SCHEDULED FOR FEB 2007.  AS THE CHIEF OF NAVAL PERSONNEL, I 
CLEARLY VIEW THE IRR AS A HIGHLY SKILLED AND TALENTED RESERVE ASSET 
WHOSE EXPERTISE SPANS THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF NAVAL OPERATIONS - A CLEAR 
FORCE MULTIPLIER.  ENSURE EVERY DETACHING MEMBER GETS A COPY OF THIS 
NAVADMIN AND THAT THEY FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR THEM TO 
SATISFACTORILY PARTICIPATE IN THE NAVY IRR.  ONE TEAM, ONE FIGHT.
