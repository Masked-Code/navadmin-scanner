RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES AND PROMULGATES THE BASIC CONCEPT, 
ORGANIZATIONAL AND POSITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE DEPLOYED RESILIENCY 
COUNSELOR (DRC) POSITION CREATED TO SUPPORT THE 21ST CENTURY SAILOR 
INITIATIVE.

2.  PER REFS (A) THROUGH (C), THE DRC IS A CIVILIAN LICENSED COUNSELOR WHO 
WILL WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH MILITARY AND CIVILIAN MEDICAL, SOCIAL SERVICE, 
LAW ENFORCEMENT, CHAPLAINS AND LEGAL PERSONNEL ON BEHALF OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 
VICTIMS TO PROVIDE SAILORS WITH CRITICAL SUPPORT SERVICES DURING DEPLOYMENTS.  
THE DRC WILL PROVIDE CLINICAL, EDUCATIONAL, AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES ACROSS A 
SPECTRUM OF CARE.  THE DRC WILL ALSO COMPLETE SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION AND 
RESPONSE (SAPR) TRAINING AND MAINTAIN CERTIFICATION TO PERFORM ASSOCIATED 
DUTIES AS REQUIRED.  FLEET AND FAMILY SERVICE CENTER (FFSC) DEPLOYED 
RESILIENCY COUNSELOR POSITIONS WILL BE INITIALLY ESTABLISHED ONBOARD AIRCRAFT 
CARRIERS (CVNS) AND LARGE-DECK AMPHIBIOUS ASSAULT SHIPS (LHAS AND LHDS) 
THROUGHOUT THE NAVY.

3.  REGIONAL FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM DIRECTORS AT COMMANDER, NAVY 
REGION SOUTHEAST; COMMANDER, NAVY REGION JAPAN; COMMANDER, NAVY REGION MID-
ATLANTIC; COMMANDER, NAVY REGION NORTHWEST AND COMMANDER, NAVY REGION 
SOUTHWEST ARE DIRECTED TO OVERSEE THE RECRUITMENT AND HIRING OF THE DRCS AT 
THOSE INSTALLATIONS WHERE IDENTIFIED HOMEPORTED SHIPS WILL UTILIZE THE DRC.  
RECRUITMENT FOR DRCS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE LOCAL FFSC AND THEIR 
SELECTION WILL BE COORDINATED WITH THE APPROPRIATE SHIP'S COMMANDING OFFICER.  
A SHIP'S REPRESENTATIVE MUST BE INVOLVED IN THE INTERVIEW PROCESS AND HAVE 
INPUT IN THE FINAL SELECTION OF THE DRC.
ALL CVNS, LHAS AND LHDS WILL HAVE DRCS ASSIGNED.

4.  JOB OFFERS TO DRC SELECTEES ARE CONTINGENT UPON TWO CRITERIA'S, A MEDICAL 
EXAM AND FITNESS FOR SHIPBOARD DUTY; AND A SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCE.
    A.  APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTS WILL BE SENT TO THE SELECTEE FOR COMPLETION BY 
THEIR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN AND RETURNED TO HUMAN RESOURCES PRIOR TO THE 
SELECTEE'S ORIENTATION.  MEDICAL EXAM DOCUMENTATION WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE 
SHIP'S GENERAL MEDICAL OFFICER WHO WILL MAKE THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE 
PROSPECTIVE DRC SELECTEE'S FITNESS FOR SHIPBOARD DUTY.
    B.  AN SF 86 APPLICATION FOR A SECRET CLEARANCE WILL BE SUBMITTED.  AN 
INITIAL BACKGROUND CHECK MUST BE COMPLETED IMMEDIATELY UPON ACCEPTANCE FOR 
THE POSITION.  A FAVORABLE INITIAL BACKGROUND CHECK WILL ALLOW FOR THE DRC TO 
START EMPLOYMENT AND AN INTERIM SECRET CLEARANCE WILL BE GRANTED.

5.  THE CORE DUTIES OF THE DRC INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:
CLINICAL COUNSELING; FAMILY ADVOCACY PROGRAM (FAP) SUPPORT AND PREVENTION 
ACTIVITIES AS DEFINED IN REFS (D) THROUGH (F); BRIEFINGS AND SUPPORT IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH THE 21ST CENTURY SAILOR INITIATIVES; AND SEXUAL ASSAULT 
RESPONSE SUPPORT, COORDINATION, AND LIAISON FOR THE HOMEPORT INSTALLATION 
SEXUAL ASSAULT RESPONSE COORDINATOR (SARC) WHILE DEPLOYED.
    A.  CLINICAL COUNSELING SERVICES.  THE DRC PROVIDES SHORT-TERM, 
CONFIDENTIAL, SOLUTION FOCUSED COUNSELING.  A WARM HAND-OFF TO THE SHIP'S 
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ASSETS, CHAPLAINS, OR TO THE HOMEPORT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH 
CLINIC WILL BE MADE IF A SAILOR PRESENTS ISSUES FALLING OUTSIDE OF THE NAVY'S 
FFSC SCOPE OF CLINICAL CARE, OR IF HIGH RISK CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ASSESSED (FOR 
EXAMPLE, SUICIDAL OR HOMICIDAL IDEATIONS).  THE DRC WILL SPECIFICALLY 
COLLABORATE WITH CHAPLAINS IN THE DELIVERY OF EDUCATIONAL AND SUPPORT 
SERVICES ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF CARE.  CHAPLAINS AND DRCS MAY EXERCISE 
RECIPROCAL REFERRALS WITH CHAPLAINS REFERRING INDIVIDUALS WITH CLINICAL 
ISSUES TO THE DRC AND THE DRC REFERRING INDIVIDUALS WITH RELIGIOUS OR 
SPIRITUAL NEEDS TO CHAPLAINS.  THE DRC PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE CARE THROUGHOUT 
ALL THE PHASES OF COUNSELING WHICH INCLUDE:  TRIAGE, INITIAL ASSESSMENT, 
TREATMENT PLANNING, CLINICAL TREATMENT, CASE MANAGEMENT AND CLOSURE.  ALL 
CASE RECORDS WILL BE MAINTAINED IN THE FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT MANAGEMENT 
INFORMATION SYSTEM (FFSMIS).
DURING INSTANCES OF INTERNET SERVICE INTERRUPTION, THE DRC WILL MAINTAIN 
PAPER DOCUMENTATION UNTIL CONNECTIVITY HAS BEEN RESTORED AND THE CASE CAN BE 
UPDATED IN FFSMIS.
    B.  FAP SUPPORT.  THE DRC ACTS AS A LIAISON TO THE HOMEPORT FAP.
THE DRC IS CONSIDERED A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER IN TERMS OF RECEIVING RESTRICTED 
REPORTS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE.  PER REFS (E) AND (F), THE DRC WILL REPORT ALL 
RESTRICTED AND UNRESTRICTED FAP DOMESTIC ABUSE INCIDENTS TO THE HOMEPORT FAP 
WITHIN PRESCRIBED TIMEFRAMES, OR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THE DRC WILL ASSIST 
THE HOMEPORT FAP IN EXECUTING A SAFETY PLAN IF NECESSARY, CONDUCT INTERVIEWS 
AND ASSESSMENTS WITH THE DEPLOYED SAILOR INVOLVED IN THE CASE AND PROVIDE 
ASSISTANCE WITH THE SERVICES RECOMMENDED BY THE CLINICAL CASE STAFF MEETING 
IF REQUESTED.
    C.  21ST CENTURY SAILOR TRAINING.  THE DRC WILL CONDUCT RESILIENCY 
TRAINING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 21ST CENTURY SAILOR INITIATIVES.  THE 
TRAINING WILL FOCUS ON SUICIDE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION, ALCOHOL AND 
DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION, AND OVERALL RESILIENCE (E.G. COMBAT OPERATIONAL STRESS 
FIRST AID).
    D.  SAPR.  THE DRC WILL SERVE AS A LIAISON TO THE HOMEPORT SARC.
THE DRC WILL BE FULLY TRAINED IN SEXUAL ASSAULT RESPONSE TO INCLUDE THE

TO THEIR ASSIGNED SHIP, UNDER THE GUIDANCE AND DIRECTION OF THE HOMEPORT 
SARC.  THIS CAN INCLUDE IMPLEMENTATION AND EXECUTION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 
AWARENESS AND PREVENTION TRAINING AND COMPREHENSIVE VICTIM ADVOCACY SUPPORT.

HAND-OFF TO THE HOMEPORT SARC AS THOROUGHLY AND EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE.

6.  DRC POSITIONS ARE HIRED AND ADMINISTRATIVELY MANAGED FROM THE FFSC WHERE 
THE DRC'S ASSIGNED SHIP IS HOMEPORTED.  THE FFSC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING 
THE DRC RECEIVES ALL TRAINING REQUIRED BY THE DRC POSITION DESCRIPTION IN 
ORDER TO SERVE ABOARD A DEPLOYED VESSEL.  THE FFSC PROVIDES ANNUAL 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS, REQUIRED CNIC TRAINING OVERSIGHT, CLINICAL 
SUPERVISION, QUALITY ASSURANCE REVIEW OF CLINICAL SERVICES, AND ALL OTHER

REQUIRED TO PASS A MEDICAL SCREENING TO ENSURE THEY CAN MEET PHYSICAL 
REQUIREMENTS OF SHIPBOARD LIVING.

SHIP SPONSOR WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSURING THAT THE DRC IS ORIENTED TO THE 
SHIP AND THAT ALL LOGISTICAL NEEDS HAVE BEEN MET.

8.  WHILE AT THE HOMEPORT AND AS DETERMINED BY THE SHIP'S CO, THE DRC MAY 
HOLD OFFICE HOURS ABOARD THE SHIP AND PROVIDE TRAINING OR GENERAL COUNSELING 
SERVICES.  WHEN NOT NEEDED ABOARD THE SHIP, THE DRC WILL FUNCTION AS A 
CLINICAL COUNSELOR AT THE FFSC.  THE FFSC DIRECTOR WILL COORDINATE DRC HOURS 
WITH THE SHIP'S EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO ENSURE OPTIMAL AVAILABILITY AND 
SCHEDULING OF THE DRC AT THE FFSC.

9.  THE CREATION OF THE DRC POSITION IS AN INNOVATIVE RESPONSE TO MEETING THE 
NEEDS OF OUR SAILORS IN A DEPLOYED ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDES LEADERSHIP WITH 
AN ADDITIONAL RESOURCE TO PROVIDE ENHANCED SUPPORT TO ALL SAILORS ABOARD.
