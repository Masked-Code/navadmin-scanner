RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE REALIGNMENT OF THE ENGINEMAN (EN) AND 
MACHINIST MATE (MM) RATINGS, AND DISESTABLISHMENT OF THE FULL TIME SUPPORT 
(FTS) ENGINEMAN RATING.  THIS REALIGNMENT APPLIES TO ACTIVE DUTY, FTS AND 
READY RESERVE SAILORS, AND IS BEING DONE TO IMPROVE DIESEL ENGINE PROFICIENCY.  
THE NAVY HAS CHANGED EN AND MM OCCUPATIONAL STANDARDS TO FOCUS DIESEL 
PROPULSION EXPERTISE IN THE EN RATING; EN SAILORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
DIESEL OPERATION, REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE.  TO CONFORM WITH THE NEW 
OCCUPATIONAL STANDARDS, A COMPLETE BILLET REVIEW TO RE-CODE EN AND MM BILLETS 
HAS BEEN CONDUCTED AND THE NEXT STEP IS TO REALIGN OUR WORKFORCE BASED ON 
THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS TO CENTRALIZE DIESEL EXPERTISE IN THE EN RATING.   
DURING THE BILLET REVIEW THE NUMBER OF FTS BILLETS
REQUIRING EN RATED SAILORS SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED, LEADING TO THE DECISION TO 
DISESTABLISH THE FTS EN RATING.  SAILORS WITH DIESEL EXPERIENCE WILL REMAIN 
WITHIN THE EN RATING, OR MAY REQUEST CONVERSION FROM MM TO EN.  SAILORS IN THE 
EN RATING WITHOUT DIESEL EXPERIENCE WILL CONVERT INTO THE MM RATING.  FTS EN 
SAILORS HAVE MANY OPTIONS TO CONSIDER, BUT ARE HIGHLY ENCOURAGED TO REENLIST 
IN THE ACTIVE COMPONENT.  COMMANDS ARE ADVISED TO CONDUCT CAREER DEVELOPMENT 
BOARDS WITH SAILORS AFFECTED BY THIS NAVADMIN IN ORDER TO FULLY REVIEW ALL 
CAREER OPTIONS.

2.  EN/MM WORKFORCE REALIGNMENT.  CURRENT EN RATED SAILORS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE 
IN DIESEL PROPULSION, AS INDICATED BY PRIMARY NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION

BACKGROUND WILL BE CONVERTED TO MM.  THE FOLLOWING NEC'S WILL REMAIN EN:  
4302, 4303, 4304, 4305, 4306, 4308, 4310, 4314, 4324, 4333, 4334, 4340, 4342, 
4343, 4346, 4366 AND 4370.  HOWEVER, SOME EN RATED SAILORS WITH LIMITED DIESEL 
PROPULSION EXPERIENCE MAY REMAIN AN EN BASED ON CAREER PROGRESSION IN REGARDS 
TO PAYGRADE, SEA SHORE FLOW, AND COMMUNITY HEALTH.  SAILORS CAN REQUEST TO 
CONVERT FROM EN TO MM.  SAILORS IN THE MM RATING WILL NOT BE AFFECTED, UNLESS 
THEY DESIRE TO CONVERT TO EN.  ENLISTED COMMUNITY MANAGERS (ECM) WILL MAKE 
FINAL APPROVAL AND DISPOSITION OF RATING CONVERSIONS TO SECURE OVERALL 
COMMUNITY HEALTH IN REGARD TO SAILOR DESIRE, CAREER PROGRESSION, SEA/SHORE 
FLOW AND BILLET DISTRIBUTION.
