2.  THE MSA PROGRAM IS TAILORED TO STUDENTS WHOSE CAREER PATHS DO

A BLENDED MIX OF DISTANCE LEARNING METHODS.  STUDENTS TAKE TWO
COURSES A QUARTER FOR EIGHT CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS WITH ONE COURSE
DELIVERED ASYNCHRONOUSLY USING WEB-BASED INSTRUCTION (ONLINE) AND
ONE COURSE DELIVERED SYNCHRONOUSLY USING VIDEO-TELE-EDUCATION (VTE).
THE WEB-BASED COURSES ARE PACED WEEK-TO-WEEK BY THE INSTRUCTORS,

3-HOUR SESSION ON TUESDAYS FROM 0800-1100 (PACIFIC TIME) EACH WEEK.
