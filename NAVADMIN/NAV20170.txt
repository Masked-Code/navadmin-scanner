3.  Background: 
a. The Olmsted Scholar Program offers outstanding young military leaders an 
unsurpassed opportunity to achieve fluency in a foreign language, pursue 
graduate study at an overseas university and acquire an in-depth 
understanding of foreign cultures, thereby equipping them to serve in 
positions of greater responsibility as senior leaders in the United States 
Armed Forces.  This unique scholarship opportunity supports the Secretary of 
Defense's emphasis on developing language skills and regional cultural 
knowledge across the force.  The Olmsted Scholar program also meets 
educational requirements for both Flag Officer and Major Command. 
b. The Olmsted Scholar Program is a three-year program for which career 
timing is an important consideration.  Applicants must contact their detailer 
for counseling on the career feasibility of participation in the Olmsted 
Scholar Program.  To be considered by the Navy selection board, a detailer 
written/signed statement, as stated in enclosure (3) of reference (a), must 
be included in the nomination package.

been extended for all eligible designators from 11 years to 13.5 years as

summer/fall 2021 at the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center in 
Monterey, CA or Washington, DC, begin two years of study at a foreign

the Olmsted Foundation Board of Directors will consider and select Navy 
scholars to receive this prestigious scholarship in March 2021.  Navy is 
seeking applicants who display the warfighting and intellectual qualities of 
dedicated career officers who aspire to command.
