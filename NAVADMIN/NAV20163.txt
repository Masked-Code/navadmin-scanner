RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces a modification to paragraph 3 of reference

allow twice failure of selection (2XFOS) lieutenants (LT) to be continued on 
Active Duty until retirement eligibility or for a period of 3 years.  The 
modification further removes from continuation engineering duty officer (EDO) 
2XFOS LT with less than 18 years of active service.
