SUBJ/NAVY LEADERSHIP CONTINUUM//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  LEADERSHIP IS THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR NAVY AND THE
KEY TO OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS.  STRONG LEADERSHIP ENSURES MISSION
READINESS FOR THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM (GWOT) AND PROVIDES OUR
MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WITH A SENSE OF PURPOSE AND COMMITMENT.
TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT AND THE WARFARE ENVIRONMENT OF THE FUTURE DEMAND
WELL LED, MOTIVATED SAILORS WHO ARE PREPARED TO EXECUTE NAVY'S
MISSIONS.  LEADERS AND THE SAILORS IN THEIR CHARGE MUST EMBRACE
THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND ENSURE SUBORDINATES' PERSONAL AND
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS A PRIORITY.  LEADERSHIP TRAINING AND
EDUCATION FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR NAVY IS AS ESSENTIAL TO OUR
LONG TERM SUCCESS AS THE INCORPORATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND
CAPABILITIES IN OUR WARFARE COMMUNITIES.
2.  THE LEADERSHIP CONTINUUM IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING THE TOOLS TO
MEET THESE CHALLENGES AND MUST BE VIEWED AS A MECHANISM FOR ENSURING
INDIVIDUAL AND UNIT SUCCESS.  THE CENTER FOR NAVAL LEADERSHIP (CNL)
HAS DESIGNED ROBUST AND INTENSIVE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THAT
CAPITALIZE ON SCENARIO-DRIVEN, DYNAMIC EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES.
SAILORS WHO COMPLETE THE LEADERSHIP PROGRAMS WILL BE BETTER PREPARED
TO MASTER THE COMPLEXITIES OF HUMAN INTERACTION AND THE CHALLENGES
AHEAD.  LEGACY LEADERSHIP COURSES HAVE BEEN FUNDAMENTALLY REVISED,
AND FUTURE COURSES WILL LEVERAGE CURRENT FLEET ISSUES AND THE
EXPERIENCES OF THOSE IN ATTENDANCE.
3.  THE NAVY'S LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT CONTINUUM CONSISTS OF
SEQUENTIAL AND PROGRESSIVE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (LDP)
ADDRESSING EACH LEVEL OF LEADERSHIP, BASED ON JOB ANALYSES AND
NAVAL LEADERSHIP PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS.  EACH LDP INCLUDES
LEARNING EVENTS THAT ARE TAILORED TO THE DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF
SPECIFIC LEADERSHIP POSITIONS (BILLETS) WITHIN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND
(E.G., LEADING PETTY OFFICER, LEADING CHIEF PETTY OFFICER, DIVISION
OFFICER, DEPARTMENT HEAD, COMMANDING OFFICER, ETC.).
    A.  THE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT CONTINUUM IS POSITION-BASED.
HOWEVER, AS PERSONNEL ARE ALSO ASSIGNED LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBILITIES
BASED ON PAYGRADE, VARYING LEVELS OF LEADERSHIP PROFICIENCY ARE
REQUIRED OF ALL NAVY PERSONNEL.  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ALL SAILORS
ACQUIRE THE TRAINING AND EDUCATION NECESSARY TO ENHANCE THEIR
LEADERSHIP SKILLS AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY FOLLOWING ADVANCEMENT
AND TO PREPARE THEMSELVES MOST EFFECTIVELY FOR POSITIONS OF
INCREASED RESPONSIBILITY.
    B.  THE LEADERSHIP CONTINUUM REFERS TO ALL TRAINING AND
DEVELOPMENT EVENTS FROM INITIAL ENTRY THROUGH RETIREMENT.  THE
CONTINUUM CONTAINS NUMEROUS LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS DESIGNED
TO PROVIDE ALL SAILORS, OFFICER AND ENLISTED, AC AND RC, WITH THE
KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND ABILITIES REQUIRED FOR POSITIONS THEY WILL
HOLD THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREERS.  LDP'S ARE COMPRISED OF IN-RESIDENCE
COURSES, E-LEARNING, COMMAND DELIVERED, ON-THE-JOB TRAINING (OJT),
AND OTHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING EVENTS.  SELECTED E-LEARNING
COURSES MUST ALSO BE COMPLETED TO SATISFY THE RESPECTIVE LDP
REQUIREMENTS.
