RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supports references (a) through (d) and announces the 
assignment optimization plan for Active Component and Training and 
Administration of Reserve Chief (CPO), Senior Chief (SCPO), and Master Chief 
Petty Officers (MCPO).  CPOs, SCPOs and MCPOs are collectively referred to as 
"Chiefs" in this message. Commander, Navy Personnel Command (COMNAVPERSCOM), 
Enlisted Distribution Division (PERS-40) will work with the Fleet Readiness 
Integrators (FRI), Type Commanders (TYCOMs) and Budget Submitting Office 
(BSO) N1 staffs to evaluate all Chiefs assigned to billets with incorrect 
paygrades or those who are not aligned to funded billet requirements.  The 
goal of this optimization plan is to ensure our most experienced enlisted 
Sailors are aligned to billets which specifically need their training, 
leadership and experience. This plan will lead to the realignment of Chiefs 
into billets appropriate to their skills and experience. 
 
2.  COMNAVPERSCOM will host one virtual Senior Enlisted Manning Summit in 
Millington, TN to evaluate and optimize all eligible candidates in the rates 
of MCPO, SCPO, and CPO.  The summit is tentatively scheduled 30 Oct - 10 Nov 
2023.  The aim of the summit will be to review all Chief assignments, with 
the goal of aligning the maximum number of Chiefs to appropriate 
billets.  This summit will allow Fleet and TYCOMs to work with COMNAVPERSCOM 
to fill their most impactful gapped billets. 
    a.  Enlisted Readiness and Placement Branch (PERS-4013) have 
provided a list of misaligned Chiefs to the FRIs.  The FRIs will distribute 
the lists of misaligned Sailors to the TYCOM and BSO N1s. Prior to the 
summit, PERS-4013 will evaluate Chief billet requirements in MyNavy 
Assignment (MNA). 
    b.  Chiefs who are aligned to billets of an incorrect paygrade may be 
subject to the following options: 
        (1) Realignment to an in-paygrade requirement at their current 
command. 
        (2) Movement to a valid billet at another command. 
Preference will be to avoid moving personnel out of their current geographic 
area, and maintaining sea-shore rotation to the maximum extent possible. 
        (3) If immediate alignment to a valid in-paygrade billet is not 
possible, then there will be an adjustment to the member's Projected Rotation 
Date (PRD), adjusted to enter the order negotiation window earlier than their 
current PRD.  Chiefs in receipt of a PRD adjustment should expect to 
negotiate for orders to fill an in-paygrade requirement and will be 
considered a sea or shore roller based on a ratio of sea and shore duty 
billets available within their paygrade. 
    c.  Enlisted manning stakeholders identified in paragraph 1 shall review 
misaligned personnel, as well as Fleet billet vacancies, and provide their 
recommendations for action at the manning summit. 
    d.  Fleet readiness concerns will guide all decisions and actions, but 
each move shall be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
    e.  The movement of realigned personnel will begin approximately 30 days 
after the summit concludes.  Any out-of-area moves will receive adequate time 
to prepare and execute.  All transfer timelines will take into account the 
vacancies that they will create and those they will fill, and limit or 
prevent "double-stuffing" of billets. 
 
3.  The summit precept requires participants to maintain integrity without 
prejudice or partiality for all Sailors evaluated.  Each participant must pay 
particular attention to each Sailor and billet to ensure that they are 
meeting the intention of CPO optimization. During deliberations, participants 
may discuss any negative impacts a realignment may have on the command or the 
Sailor.  Before any decisions are made, TYCOM/BSO and FRIs will provide their 
input.  If the requested actions are within one FRI, the FRI will make final 
decisions.  If the requested action involves more than one FRI and there is a 
disagreement, the manning control authority will make the final decision.  A 
copy of the precept will be provided to participants by the summit 
coordinators. 
 
4.  Fleet activities shall continue evaluating MNA alignments to ensure that 
Sailors are accurately aligned aboard their current activity.  Chiefs should 
be aligned to billets for their specific paygrades.  If Sailors of any 
paygrade need to be realigned to another billet, the command Activity Manning 
Manager (AMM) should submit a Member Realignment Request (MRR) in MNA.  If 
the MRR is approved, PERS-4013 will update the alignment.  AMMs should 
contact their command Placement Coordinator in PERS-4013 with any questions 
or concerns. 
 
5.  Key Messages: 
    a.  Sailors.  We are working to better align our enlisted supervisors to 
billets which require their skills and experience. 
The emphasis on operational readiness and unit prioritization reflect our 
identity as a sea service.  We must preserve the readiness of the Fleet and 
ensure that Chiefs are optimally assigned to meet mission readiness.  We will 
take each Sailor's personal considerations into account.  I know that this 
may induce additional hardship for some Sailors and their families, and I 
sincerely thank them for their service and sacrifice. 
    b.  Commands.  Commanders, commanding officers, executive officers, and 
senior enlisted leaders must ensure their Sailors understand the intent of 
this message.
