RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the restoration of the aviation command 
retention bonus (ACRB).  The ACRB is designed to retain for continued naval 
service those aviation officers with the talent and command experience in our 
warfighting missions that is critical for the future of our institution.  
These O-5 commanding officers lead our naval aviation force today, and their 
skill set and leadership experience are essential to our Navy*s success in 
the future.

2.  All officers sitting in command of eligible units beginning
8 September 2014 are eligible to apply.  Prospective commanding officers 
become eligible to apply for the ACRB on the day they take command; 
eligibility to apply ends on the officer*s last day in command of the 
eligible unit.  All eligible officers will be offered $36,000, paid in two 
installments of $18,000, in return for a commitment to remain on active duty 
as a Naval Aviator or Naval Flight Officer through the end of their 22nd year 
of commissioned service, or for two years from the date of contract approval, 
whichever is later.
