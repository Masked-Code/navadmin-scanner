RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the renewal and modification to the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) 
Critical Skills Retention Bonus (CSRB) for qualified NSW officers and cancels refs (a) and (b).  Retaining 
NSW officers is a priority for the Navy.  The NSW CSRB is a flexible retention incentive that focuses on 
improving retention of NSW control grade officers.  NSW officers who meet the eligibility criteria in this 
NAVADMIN and hold a 1130 or 1137 designator may apply for this incentive. 

2.  Program Overview.  This bonus is authorized under ref (c), section 355.  
Qualified officers will be offered the opportunity to commit to a five-year or a three-year agreement for 
bonus amounts listed in paragraph 5.  Specific designation of NSW officers as a critical skill and approved 
award levels were prescribed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  NSW Officer Community 
Manager (BUPERS-311D) is designated as the NSW CSRB Program Manager.  All applications for this 
bonus will be submitted to the program manager for approval, payment processing and tracking.  The 
eligibility criteria stated in this NAVADMIN can be changed at any time by the program manager if a 
bonus reduction is warranted based on the needs of the NSW community.

3.  Program Eligibility.  NSW officers with designators 1130 or 1137, who have completed at least 15 
years of active duty commissioned service (ADCS), may be offered the NSW CSRB.  Applicants must meet 
the following eligibility
criteria:
    a.  Designated as a NSW officer (designator 1130 or 1137).
    b.  Receive commanding officer's (CO) written endorsement.  CO must ensure applications are 
accurate and verify applicants meet eligibility requirements.

4.  Program Execution:  
    a.  Officers must submit their request letter to the NSW CSRB program manager via their chain of 
command.
    b.  Officers will receive their bonus amount upon agreement acceptance and then annual anniversary 
payments through the term of the agreement. 
    c.  Upon acceptance of an officer's agreement by the program manager, the amount of the bonus 
becomes fixed and the officer incurs a firm service obligation.
    d.  CSRB requests for personnel who are being processed for officer designation removal or additional 
qualification designation removal will be held in abeyance pending final resolution of the action in 
question. 

5.  NSW Officer CSRB contract lengths and payments are outlined below.
    a.  The NSW CSRB will be offered in two phases.  Officers will be paid a fixed amount per year of
