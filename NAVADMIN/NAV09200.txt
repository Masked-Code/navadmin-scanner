SUBJ/SAILORS ENABLED TO SUBMIT THEIR OWN JOB APPLICATIONS USING THE 
CAREER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM/INTERACTIVE DETAILING//

RMKS/1.  THIS MESSAGE ANNOUNCES RELEASE OF THE OPTIONAL CAPABILITY FOR 
ACTIVE DUTY SAILORS TO SUBMIT THEIR OWN PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION 
(PCS) JOB APPLICATIONS IN CMS/ID VIA THE INTERNET BEGINNING IN JULY 
2009.  THIS ADDED FUNCTIONALITY REFLECTS OUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO 
PLACE MORE CAREER MANAGEMENT TOOLS IN THE HANDS OF OUR SAILORS AS A 
CORE INITIATIVE IN THE NAVY'S TOTAL FORCE STRATEGY.
THIS NEW FUNCTIONALITY MIRRORS THE PROCESS ALREADY USED BY DRILLING 
RESERVISTS TO SUBMIT ASSIGNMENT REQUESTS.  AFLOAT SAILORS WITHOUT 
INTERNET ACCESS SHOULD CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR DETAILERS 
THROUGH THE CAREER COUNSELOR AND CHAIN OF COMMAND.  APPLICATIONS 
RECEIVED VIA TRADITIONAL METHODS WILL BE TREATED THE SAME BY DETAILERS 
AS APPLICATIONS RECEIVED BY CMS/ID, AS ALL JOB SELECTIONS ARE MADE 
AFTER THE MONTHLY APPLICATION CYCLE CLOSES.

2.  SAILORS MUST MEET PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) REQUIREMENTS AS OUTLINED 
IN NAVADMINS 017/09 AND 161/09 AND BE WITHIN THEIR ORDERS NEGOTIATION 
WINDOW IN ORDER TO SUBMIT APPLICATIONS.

3.  CAREER COUNSELORS AND DETAILERS WILL RETAIN THE ABILITY TO SUBMIT 
PCS JOB APPLICATIONS ON BEHALF OF SAILORS.

4.  ROBUST COMMAND INVOLVEMENT IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE NO SAILOR ENTERS 
THE ORDERS NEGOTIATING PROCESS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF GOOD CAREER 
COUNSELING AND CHAIN OF COMMAND MENTORSHIP.  SAILORS SHOULD CONTINUE TO 
SEEK COMMAND AND CAREER COUNSELOR GUIDANCE PRIOR TO APPLYING.
