2.  If a selected officer does not decline his or her promotion in writing
prior to his or her projected date of rank (noted above in paragraph 1), that
officer is considered to have accepted the promotion on the date indicated.
An officer who chooses to decline his or her promotion must submit the
declination in writing to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806), prior to the effective
date indicated above.  Limited duty officers declining appointment to
lieutenant will be reverted to enlisted status within 90 days of projected
promotion date.

3.  The commanding officer (CO), the Secretary of the Navy or his designee,
have the authority to delay projected appointments.  Upon the exercise of a
delay, the officer shall be notified in writing before the effective date of
the appointment, and not be tendered the appointment.  The delay authority
will immediately forward the recommendation to delay with supporting
documentation to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-83), copy to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806).

4.  COs are reminded of their responsibility to ensure the officers they are
promoting are mentally, physically, morally and professionally qualified.
Per reference (a), officers are ineligible for promotion if they have failed
the most recent Physical Fitness Assessment.  COs shall verify the promoting
officer's information in the Physical Readiness Information Management System
(PRIMS) to ensure compliance with reference (a) and delay the officers
promotion in accordance with paragraph 3 if required.

5.  Prepare a Delivery of Temporary/Permanent Appointment (NAVPERS form
1421/7) (Rev 10-13).  Use this NAVADMIN as reference (a).  Use section 624 of
title 10, U.S. Code as reference (b), for permanent lieutenants and above.
Use section 578 of title 10, U.S.C. as reference (b), for chief warrant
officers.  Use sections 624 and 5589 of title 10, U.S. Code as reference (b),
for limited duty officer promotion to lieutenant.  Limited duty officer
appointment to lieutenant is a permanent appointment; acceptance of the
appointment is acceptance of permanent appointment as a limited duty officer.
Mail the completed form to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806).

6.  Officers should review reference (b), for minimum time-in-grade
requirements for purposes of voluntary retirement.  Full time support
officers and those officers temporarily on active-duty anticipating release
from active-duty under reference (c), may accept promotion without incurring
any additional active-duty obligation.

7.  New photographs are required for all officers within three months after
acceptance of promotion.  See reference (d), for specific requirements.
