AMPN/REF (A) IS CNO INSTRUCTION ON ANNUAL COMMAND OPERATIONS REPORT//

RMKS/1.  Per reference (a), all officers in command (afloat and ashore, 
including all task forces, groups, and units) will submit an annual Command 
Operations Report (COR) for their unit by 1 March 2021.  Also, any CORs from 
the previous year (CY2019) will be submitted regardless of their delinquent 
status.

2.  CORs should be submitted electronically to the Naval History and Heritage 
Command (NHHC).  Reference (a) and a template with guidance are available on 
the NHHC's COR website. (See https://www.history.navy.mil/about-
us/instructions-and-forms/submit-a-command-operations-report.html).  
Questions about the report should be directed to NHHC_COR(AT)navy.mil.

3.  The COR must be classified at the level necessary to describe completely 
the respective commands operations and actions over the last year.  CORs 
classified no higher than the Secret level should be sent to 
NHHC_COR(AT)navy.smil.mil.
Reports classified higher than Secret are also accepted and welcome.  Contact 
listed SIPRNet email for instruction.

4.  Each command with a Unit Identification Code (UIC) is required to submit 
their own report with one exception:  If a command has 25 or fewer full-time 
employees, their ISIC can submit on their behalf.  Commands with 26 or more 
full time employees (including military, civilian, and/or contractor) will 
submit their own report.  ISICs are expected to ensure their subordinates 
submit reports.  Inquiries regarding submission status may be sent to 
NHHC_COR(AT)navy.mil.

5.  CY2020 CORs will include information pertaining to activities in response 
to COVID-19.  This information, including but not limited to, reports, 
briefs, messages, white papers, emails, and images, will be included in the 
COR package as supporting reports.  Narrative sections will include 
information recounting COVID-19 preparedness, challenges, impacts on 
operations, and command response.
Chronology sections will include dates corresponding to preparedness 
measures, incidents, and responses.  The classification level of this 
information should not be the determining factor of its inclusion.

6.  Point of Contact:  The COR Program may be contacted at comm: (202) 433-
9873 and email: NHHC_COR(AT)navy.mil or NHHC_COR(AT)navy.smil.mil.

7.  Released by Mr. Andrew S. Haeuptle, Director, Navy Staff.//
