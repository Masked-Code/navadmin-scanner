RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Blended Retirement System (BRS) 
mid-career Continuation Pay (CP) rates for Calendar Year (CY) 2025. 
For CY25 CP rates for Active Component is two and a half times the 
monthly basic pay for a Service Member of that grade who has reached 
12 Years of Service (YOS).  Total CP for Training and Administration 
of the Reserves is two and a half times the monthly basic pay for a 
Service Member of that grade who has reached 12 YOS.  Total CP for 
Selected Reserve is half the monthly basic pay for a Service Member 
of that grade who has reached 12 YOS. 
 
2.  In line with references (a) through (d), Service Members who 
want to receive the mid-career CP are reminded that they must be 
enrolled in BRS and request CP before 12 YOS.  The CP election is 
made via Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) which can 
be accessed via MyNavy Portal quick links.  For Service Members who 
have provided NSIPS with an up-to-date email address, NSIPS will 
send an email notification of CP eligibility at 11 years 6 months 
YOS, 11 years 9 months YOS and a final reminder at 11 years 11 
months YOS.  Service Members who are unable to elect CP through 
NSIPS may manually elect CP through their command career counselor 
via NAVPERS 1070-613.  CP information to include details on electing 
CP can be found in references (c) and (d).  A copy of the CY25 CP 
rate memorandum can be found at 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/Culture-Resilience/Family-
Readiness/Personal-Financial-Mgmt/.   
For any other CP issues, Service Members should reach out to MyNavy Career 
Center (MNCC) at 833-330-MNCC or askmncc.fct@navy.mil.
