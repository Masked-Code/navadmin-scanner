RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance for administration of the January 
2015 E7 Navy-Wide Advancement Examination and the FY-16 Active and Full Time 
Support (FTS) E7 Selection Board Cycle 226.
    a.  It is the responsibility of the candidate and command to ensure that 
the candidate*s official military personnel file (OMPF) is up-to-date and any 
discrepancy impacting the eligibility of the candidate, to include being in 
the correct competitive group, is identified to PERS-802/812 prior to board 
convening.
The authoritative source to determine if a candidate is selection board 
eligible or not is the profile sheet.  Because eligibility status can change 
without direct notification, candidates should verify their profile sheet on 
a continuous basis up to the board convening date.
    b.  Communication to the board must originate from the individual Sailor 
and must be accompanied under the candidate*s signed letter to the board 
(LTB).  Information received that is not under a signed LTB or not received 
by Navy Personnel Command
(NPC) Customer Service Center (CSC) by the established deadline will not be 
presented to the board.

2.  Timeline
    a.  15 January 2015:  Administration of exams for USN/USNR (Active), 
(FTS).
    b.  28 February 2015:  Individual Augmentation (IA) evaluations used for 
time-in-rate (TIR) waivers must have an ending date by this date and must be 
available to the board.
    c.  17 April 2015:  FTS board candidates changing rating must be in their 
new rating by this date to be considered for selection in the new rating.

reference (b), nuclear candidates will be assigned NEC 3359/3389 upon 
transfer of a nuclear propulsion plant operator to a non-nuclear billet at 
sea or ashore, or to duty under instruction including special college 
education programs.
Therefore, nuclear candidates transferred to a STA-21 duty station will not 
be selection board eligible.
    f.  Security Clearance.  Candidates in a rating requiring a security 
clearance must have a favorable investigation adjudication issued by the 
Department of Defense Central Adjudication Facility or the commanding 
officer*s interim clearance must have been granted before 1 January 2015. 
Refer to reference (c) for additional guidance.  Once Sailors have a 
clearance they must maintain that clearance eligibility.  If for any reason a 
clearance is denied or revoked, an exam is not authorized until a new 
clearance is granted.

binders, folders or tabs) and submitted under signed cover letter to the 
president of the board.  Candidates must verify that the correct board number

utilize the safe access file exchange (SAFE) website at 
https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/safe to transmit their LTB to
