SUBJ/RATING ENTRY FOR GENERAL APPRENTICES (REGA)// 

GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  ENSURING THE FLEET IS PROVIDING SAILORS WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS IN THE RIGHT JOBS IS THE PRINCIPAL GOAL OF THE NAVY'S TOTAL FORCE INTEGRATION, WHICH SHAPES THE FORCE TO MEET CHANGING MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS.  KEEPING SAILORS INFORMED OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES ENABLES GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND CONTROL OF THEIR CAREERS.

2.  HISTORICALLY, NAVY HAS COMBINED THE RATING ENTRY FOR GENERAL APPRENTICES
(REGA) AND CAREER REENLISTMENT OBJECTIVES (CREO) IN THE SAME NAVADMIN.
WHILE BOTH REGA AND CREO ARE APPLICABLE INDICATORS OF A SAILOR'S CAREER PROGRESSION, REGA IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE NON-DESIGNATED SAILORS WITH A VIABLE PATH TO ENTER THE PETTY OFFICER WORKFORCE.

3.  AS PART OF THE OVERALL COMMITMENT TO NAVYS "STRATEGY FOR OUR PEOPLE" AND TO PROVIDE SAILORS WITH RELEVANT AND TIMELY INFORMATION THAT WILL IMPACT CRITICAL CAREER DECISIONS, REGA WILL NOW BE PUBLISHED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING PUBLICATION OF THE PETTY OFFICER ADVANCEMENT RESULTS.  CREO INFORMATION WILL BE PUBLISHED SEMI-ANNUALLY FOLLOWING CHANGES TO THE ENLISTED PROGRAM AUTHORIZATIONS (EPA) AND WILL REFLECT PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) GUIDANCE, ADVANCEMENT FORECASTS, AND CONVERSION OPPORTUNITIES FOR SAILORS CURRENTLY IN OVERMANNED RATINGS.

4.  TO EXECUTE A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY FOR OUR NON-DESIGNATED SAILORS, COMMANDS SHOULD UTILIZE THE FLEET RATING IDENTIFICATION ENGINE (FLEET RIDE) AT HTTPS:/FLEETRIDE.SPAWARITC.NAVY.MIL TO VALIDATE QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE DESIRED RATING.  BASIC PERSONNEL DATA FOR ALL GENDETS HAS BEEN PRE-POPULATED INTO FLEET RIDE AND SHOULD BE VERIFIED FOR ACCURACY.  THIS INFORMATION INCLUDES SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (SSN), NAME, RATE, ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE DATE (ADSD), GENDER, AND THE MOST RECENT ARMED FORCES VOCATIONAL APTITUDE BATTERY (ASVAB)/ARMED FORCES QUALIFICATION TEST (AFQT) DATA AS REFLECTED IN THE ENLISTED MASTER FILE.  ADDITIONALLY, OTHER UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS FOR RATING ENTRY (E.G. MEDICAL, LEGAL, CITIZENSHIP AND SECURITY CLEARANCE ELIGIBILITY,
ETC.) SHOULD BE VERIFIED AND ENTERED PRIOR TO RATING ELIGIBILITY SCREENING.
COMMAND REPRESENTATIVES WILL UTILIZE THIS DATA TO CONDUCT CAREER DEVELOPMENT BOARDS (CDB) ON ALL NON-DESIGNATED SAILORS TO GUIDE THEM INTO A RATING THAT WILL PROVIDE FAVORABLE CAREER PROGRESSION.

5.  THIS PARAGRAPH LISTS EACH RATING AND THE PROCEDURES FOR NON-DESIGNATED SAILORS TO ENTER THAT RATING VIA EXAMINATION, IF AUTHORIZED.  COMMAND LEADERSHIP SHOULD UTILIZE THIS INFORMATION TO PROPERLY COUNSEL SAILORS TO ENSURE THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS.  THE COLUMNS LIST:  RATING; RATING ENTRY STATUS; OVERALL ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY TO E-4 FOR ALL SAILORS (LAST TWO CYCLES); OVERALL ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY TO E-4 FOR NON-DESIGNATED SAILORS (LAST TWO CYCLES); AND OVERALL OPPORTUNITY TO E-3 DESIGNATION FOR NON-DESIGNATED SAILORS (LAST TWO CYCLES).  RATING-SPECIFIC INFORMATION IS LISTED UNDER THE NOTES COLUMN AND CAN BE FOUND IN PARA 6 BELOW.  "N/A"
