NARR/REF A IS TASK FORCE NAVY FAMILY PLANNING ORDER.  REF B IS
NAVADMIN 236/05.//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  ON 15 FEBRUARY 2006, TASK FORCE NAVY FAMILY
(TFNF) WAS OFFICIALLY DISESTABLISHED.  AS THOSE PERSONNEL ASSIGNED
TO THE TASK FORCE REPORT BACK TO THEIR PARENT COMMANDS, PLEASE KNOW
THAT YOU HAVE MY -- AND THIS NAVY S -- UNMITIGATED GRATITUDE.
2.  WHEN I STOOD UP TFNF BACK IN SEPTEMBER 2005, I LIKENED THE
PLIGHT OF THE THOUSANDS OF NAVY FAMILY MEMBERS AFFECTED BY GULF
COAST HURRICANES TO A MAN OVERBOARD.  I SAID WE WERE GOING TO THROW
THE RUDDER HARD OVER AND PICK THEM UP, AND FOR THE GREAT MAJORITY,
WE DID.  YOU DID.  YOU GOT THEM BACK ABOARD AND HELPED THEM PUT THE
PIECES OF THEIR SHATTERED LIVES AND HOMES BACK TOGETHER.  THANK YOU
FOR YOUR DEDICATION TO THE TASK.
3.  THAT TASK, HOWEVER, IS NOT COMPLETE.  IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 4,000
SERVICE AND FAMILY MEMBERS ARE STILL "IN THE WATER," REQUIRING
ASSISTANCE IN SOME FORM OR FASHION.  THOUGH I AM COMFORTABLE WE HAVE
REACHED THE STAGE AT WHICH THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE UNDERPINNING
TFNF IS NO LONGER NEEDED, I STAND FIRM IN MY CONVICTION THAT THE
NAVY WILL ADDRESS AND RESOLVE -- TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE --
EACH AND EVERY REMAINING ISSUE.  TFNF MAY BE NO MORE, BUT THE MAN
OVERBOARD MANEUVER CONTINUES.  THE RUDDER WILL STAY HARD OVER.
4.  EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, THE OFFICE OF FLEET READINESS AND
LOGISTICS (OPNAV N4) ASSUMES OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
RESOLUTION OF ALL OUTSTANDING ISSUES.  SPECIFICALLY, OPNAV N4 WILL:
A.  PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO SUPPORT ASSIGNED
RESPONSIBILITIES AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES
B. DOCUMENT AND REPORT THE STATUS OF ALL AFFECTED MEMBERS OF THE
NAVY FAMILY
C.  PROVIDE FREQUENT, PERIODIC FOLLOW-UP WITH AFFECTED COMMANDS AND
MEMBERS.  COMMANDER, NAVY INSTALLATIONS; THE CHIEF OF NAVAL
PERSONNEL; THE BUREAU OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY; NAVY LEGAL SERVICE
COMMAND; THE OFFICE OF CIVILIAN HUMAN RESOURCES, AND ALL AFFECTED
LOCAL COMMANDS WILL SUPPORT OPNAV N4 WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE AREAS
OF EXPERTISE.
5.  SAILORS AND FAMILY MEMBERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONTINUE TO SEEK
LOCAL ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT CENTERS (CSC). CSC S
SERVE AS "ONE-STOP SHOPS" FOR ALL REFERRAL AND SUPPORT SERVICES, TO
INCLUDE HOUSING, TRANSPORTATION, MEDICAL, LEGAL, CIVILIAN HRO,
MILITARY PAY AND BENEFITS, CHAPLAIN/PASTORAL, CHILD CARE,
EMPLOYMENT, AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT.  THERE ARE CSC S AT NAVAL AIR
STATION/JRB NEW ORLEANS; NAVAL SUPPORT ACTIVITY MID-SOUTH
(MILLINGTON, TN), NAVAL STATION PASCAGOULA, MS; NAVAL CONSTRUCTION
BATTALION CENTER GULFPORT, MS; NAVAL AIR STATION JACKSONVILLE, FL;
NAVAL AIR STATION KEY WEST, FL; NAVAL STATION MAYPORT, FL; NAVAL AIR
STATION PENSACOLA, FL; NAVAL AIR STATION CORPUS CHRISTI, TX; AND JRB
FORT WORTH, TX.
6.  THE PROFESSIONALS MANNING THESE CENTERS ARE THERE TO HELP YOU.
THEY WILL STAY ON THE JOB FOR AS LONG AS YOU NEED THEM.  YOU CAN LOG
ON TO TASKFORCENAVYFAMILY.NAVY.MIL\NAVYFAMILIES\ FOR CONTACT AND
OTHER INFORMATION.  THE WEBSITE WILL STAY ACTIVE INDEFINITELY.  YOU
CAN ALSO SEEK HELP BY CALLING THE HELPLINE FOR HURRICANE-AFFECTED AT
(866) 345-8179 - THAT NUMBER WILL SOON BE AVAILABLE 24 HOURS A DAY.
7.  THE STORMS HAVE PASSED. LIFE, FOR SOME, IS RETURNING TO NORMAL.
BUT THERE IS WORK YET DO AND NEEDS YET TO BE MET.  WHEN AND ONLY
WHEN WE HAVE RESOLVED ALL REMAINING ISSUES -- TO THE SATISFACTION,
NOT OF OURSELVES, BUT OF THOSE FAMILIES STILL IN NEED -- WILL WE
HEAVE TO AND CALL IT A DAY.  THE NAVY FAMILY MAKES ALL THAT WE DO
POSSIBLE.  WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE WE CAN
FOR THEM.
8.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL MIKE MULLEN, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
