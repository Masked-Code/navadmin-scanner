RMKS/1.  FROM 19-26 APRIL 2009, THE NATION MARKS THE DAYS OF
REMEMBRANCE, WHICH RUN FROM THE SUNDAY BEFORE "YOM HASHOAH"
(HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY) THROUGH THE SUNDAY FOLLOWING.  THIS YEAR 
YOM HASHOAH IS TUESDAY, 21 APRIL 2009, AND THE NATIONAL THEME IS "NEVER 
AGAIN: WHAT YOU DO MATTERS."
2.  IN 1980, A JOINT CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTION ESTABLISHED THE
NATIONAL HOLOCAUST MUSEUM AND THE NATIONAL DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE.  THIS 
PERIOD IS A TIME FOR US TO REFLECT ON THE 12 YEARS OF HORRIFIC
PERSECUTION AND GENOCIDE THAT TOOK THE LIVES OF 6 MILLION JEWS, AS
WELL AS MILLIONS OF OTHERS.  DISTANCE AND DENIAL ANESTHETIZED MANY
AROUND THE WORLD TO THE FULL IMPACT OF THE PERPETRATORS' ACTIONS.  IT 
WAS NOT UNTIL ALLIED FORCES BEGAN LIBERATING CONCENTRATION CAMPS, THAT 
THE WORLD BECAME AWARE OF THE FULL EXTENT OF THE ATROCITIES THAT HAD 
TAKEN PLACE.
3.  HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR ELIE WIESEL SAID, "THERE MAY BE TIMES WHEN
WE ARE POWERLESS TO PREVENT INJUSTICE, BUT THERE MUST NEVER BE A TIME 
WHEN WE FAIL TO PROTEST."  REMEMBERING THE HOLOCAUST REMINDS US OF THE 
NEED FOR CONSTANT VIGILANCE IN OUR DEMOCRATIC IDEALS.  EACH OF US HAS 
THE POWER TO PROTEST OR REMAIN SILENT, BUT WE ARE ALL FORTUNATE TO LIVE 
IN A COUNTRY WHERE THESE RIGHTS ARE MAINTAINED.  YOU ARE OFTEN TASKED 
WITH SUPPORTING OTHERS LESS FORTUNATE AS THEY STRUGGLE FOR BASIC HUMAN 
RIGHTS AND SECURITY.  BE PROUD OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION, AND REMEMBER THAT 
WHAT YOU DO MATTERS.
4.  COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO OBSERVE HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY
THROUGH EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, EXHIBITS, PUBLICATIONS, AND PARTICIPATION 
IN MILITARY AND COMMUNITY EVENTS.
