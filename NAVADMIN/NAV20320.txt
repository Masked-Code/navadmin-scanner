QUALIFICATIONS//

NARR/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1220.1E, CHANGING OR REMOVING NAVY ENLISTED 
CLASSIFICATION CODES FOR NUCLEAR PROPULSION PLANT PERSONNEL.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the implementation of the N33Z Navy enlisted 
classification (NEC) code to document qualification as an engineering watch 
supervisor (EWS) and propulsion plant watch supervisor (PPWS).

2.  N33Z is a secondary NEC that is awarded after a Sailor qualifies EWS or 
PPWS and will be used in conjunction with the Sailors primary NEC.

3.  For Sailors to be assigned the N33Z NEC, the following is
required:
    a.  Submit a NAVPERS 1221/6 (NEC Change Request) signed by the commanding 
officer (CO), or reactor officer (RO) on CVNs, requesting assignment of N33Z 
NEC and the associated effective date in YYMM format.  By direction 
signatures are not authorized.
    b.  The *effective date* is defined as the year and month of the Sailors 
initial qualification of EWS or PPWS.  The effective date shall be annotated 
in block 12 of the NAVPERS 1221/6.
    c.  COs, or ROs on CVNs, must verify the effective date of qualification 
prior to submitting the NAVPERS 1221/6.
    d.  For commands with multiple Sailors who are qualified EWS or PPWS, a 
single NAVPERS 1221/6 shall be submitted with an attached letter signed by 
the CO, or RO on CVNs.  This letter shall identify the applicable Sailors 
names (last name, first name, middle initial), rates/ranks, social security 
number, and the qualification effective dates.  *REF ATTACHED* must be 
entered in blocks 3, 4 and
5 of the NAVPERS 1221/6.
    e.  No other documentation is required to be submitted to Nuclear 
Enlisted Community Manager (OPNAV N133D).

4.  For all future Sailors who qualify EWS or PPWS, a NAVPERS 1221/6 shall be 
submitted to request assignment of the N33Z NEC.  COs, or ROs on CVNs, shall 
verify the effective date is the qualification date and annotate the 
effective date in block 12 of the NAVPERS 1221/6.

5.  Submit all N33Z NEC requests to OPNAV N133D via e-mail to 
bullnuke(at)navy.mil.

6.  The N33Z NEC will be managed during re-qualifications as
follows:
    a.  Sailors shall nominally requalify within 6 months of reporting 
onboard a submarine or CVN.
    b.  ROs on CVNs shall determine the appropriate requalification time 
periods for personnel to qualify PPWS for those who previously qualified EWS 
on a submarine or a Nuclear Power Training Unit.
    c.  The removal of N33Z should be recommended by a CO when the Sailor 
fails to requalify in the allotted time described in paragraphs 6(a) or 6(b) 
and after failing to complete any upgrade programs.  In these cases, the CO 
must also address the disposition of the primary NEC (NEC N1XO/N2XO or 
N1XS/N2XS) of the Service Member.  The removal of the N33Z NEC does not 
require removal of the supervisor NEC of the Service Member for E-6 and below 
personnel but will result in removal of all nuclear NECs for E-7 and above.  
COs are required to submit a NAVPERS 1221/6 requesting removal of the N33Z.

7.  The removal of NEC N33Z should be recommended when the CO considers the 
Sailor no longer suitable to carry out the duties and responsibilities 
associated with the N33Z NEC.  In these cases, the CO must also address the 
disposition of the primary NEC (NEC N1XO/N2XO or N1XS/N2XS) of Service 
Members.  The removal of the N33Z NEC does not require removal of the 
supervisor NEC of Service Members for E-6 and below personnel but will result 
in removal of all nuclear NECs for E-7 and above.  COs are required to submit 
a NAVPERS 1221/6 requesting removal of the N33Z.

8.  Points of contact: for all questions and concerns, commands and Sailors 
should contact OPNAV N133D at (703)604-5491/DSN 664, (703)604-5492/DSN 664, 
or via e-mail at bullnuke(at)navy.mil.

9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until reference (a) is revised.
