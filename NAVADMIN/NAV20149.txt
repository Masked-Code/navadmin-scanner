RMKS/1. This NAVADMIN announces application procedures for the September 2020 
Distance Learning Executive Master of Business Administration (EMBA) program.

2.  Background:
    a.  The Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) defense focused EMBA is a 24 
month, fully-funded, part-time graduate program focused on financial 
management. The program targets middle to senior grade active-duty officers, 
lieutenant commander (select) and senior (lieutenant by waiver).
    b.  Classes are delivered via online technologies with synchronous, live 
interaction between faculty and students. All students are required to have a 
computer with internet access, a webcam and a microphone.
    c.  The EMBA program begins with a required one-week Temporary Duty (TDY) 
in-residence session at NPS in Monterey, CA., that is currently scheduled for 
21-25 September 2020. Pandemic restrictions on travel may result in 
rescheduling the in-resident portion.  The residency week includes an 
orientation and a graduate-level course on the management of teams. A second 
week of required TDY in-residence instruction will be scheduled during the 
second year of the EMBA program. Other than these two visits to NPS Monterey, 
students complete all instruction from their duty locations. The parent 
command of the student will provide official travel orders and funding for 
TDY travel. If command funding is not available, students may fund their own 
travel and utilize no-cost TDY orders from their commands.
    d.  Active duty Naval officers accepted into the EMBA program are 
integrated into cohorts with civilian students.  Typically, a cohort is 
comprised of approximately 25 students from which student teams are formed. 
Cohorts take all classes together during the 24 months of instruction on one 
day per week for approximately six to seven hours per day during regular 
continental United States duty hours.

3.  Criteria:
    a.  Eligibility requirements include an undergraduate degree from a 
regionally accredited 4-year college or university, 2.6 grade point average 
or higher on a 4 point scale, and at least one college-level mathematics 
course. A commanding officer endorsement letter is required to participate in 
the program. Department head or similar mid-level management experience and 
strong potential for promotion are preferred. Participants must have a 
projected rotation date no earlier than September 2022. The Graduate 
Management Admission Test is not required.
    b.  Admission to the EMBA program is available to applicants in any 
geographic location, regardless of the number of applicants in a location.

4.  Application Process:
    a.  Officers interested in the EMBA program can visit the NPS EMBA home 
page at www.nps.edu/emba for detailed eligibility and application process 
information. Deadline for the application process is no later than 6 July 
2020. Online instruction begins 29 September 2020.

5.  Post Graduation:
    a.  Graduates will be awarded an EMBA graduate degree from NPS and the 
Navy subspecialty code 3100P, Financial Management-Defense Focus.
Graduates working in acquisition billets will also earn Defense Acquisition 
University Level II equivalencies for all program management functional 
training.
    b.  As directed by reference (a), officers participating in this program 
must agree to remain on active duty following completion of graduate studies 
for a period of 3 years. This obligation is discharged concurrently with any 
other service obligation already incurred. This agreement does not obligate 
the Navy to retain the officer on active duty.

6.  Point of contact:
    a.  NPS EMBA program office, at (831) 656- 2562/DSN 756, or via e-mail at 
emba(at)nps.edu.

7. This message will remain in effect until superseded or 31 December 2020, 
whichever occurs first.
