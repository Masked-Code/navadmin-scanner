GENTEXT/RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the cancellation of 
automatic Family Service Members' Group Life Insurance (FSGLI) 
enrollment of spouses (active and reserve) who are military members 
and the intent to reimburse members who had premiums incorrectly 
deducted from their pay accounts.

2.  Per section 642 of ref (a), military members married to military 
members on or after 2 January 2013 will no longer be automatically 
enrolled for FSGLI coverage; this was codified into law in ref (b).  
In cases where Sailors married another military member on or after 
2 January 2013, neither member is currently covered under the FSGLI 
program, but premiums were automatically deducted from each member 
through April 2013, due to system configuration.  These erroneously 
collected premiums will be refunded. 

3.  Sailors married to non-military spouses are not affected by this 
change.  The non-military spouse of a Sailor with Servicemembers' 
Group Life Insurance (SGLI) coverage will automatically be enrolled 
in the FSGLI program.

4.  Sailors married to military members desiring to enroll their 
spouse in the FSGLI program should submit completed Family Coverage 
Election form (SGLV 8286A) to the personnel office or servicing 
Personnel Support Detachment (PSD).  The personnel office or PSD 
will retain the document until incorrectly collected premiums are 
refunded.  The SGLV 8286A will then be submitted electronically for 
adjudication.  Enrolled qualified spouses are covered from the date 
of submission to the personnel office or PSD.  Enrollment forms 
requiring Office of Servicemember's Group Life Insurance (OSGLI) 
approval of pre-existing health conditions should be forwarded to 
OSGLI by the PSD or personnel office upon receipt.  Upon completion 
of system updates and premium refunds, electronic enrollment will be 
processed, and premiums will be retroactively collected from the date
of enrollment.  

5.  The following scenarios illustrate a Service member's options:
    a.  Sailor married military member prior to 2 January 2013:    
        (1) Both members were automatically enrolled in FSGLI.
        (2) Coverage was effective as of the date of the marriage.
        (3) Premiums were collected as of the date of marriage.
        (4) Either member may decline FSGLI coverage per ref (b).
    b.  Sailor marries a military member on or after 2 January 2013:
        (1) Sailor is not enrolled in FSGLI.
        (2) Erroneous automatic premium deductions made between 
2 January 2013 and April 2013 have been stopped and are being 
refunded.  
        (3) Automatic enrollment did not constitute spouse FSGLI 
            coverage.
        (4) Sailors desiring to enroll their military spouse in the 
FSGLI program must complete and submit a SGLV 8286A.  Members are 
reminded to carefully follow instructions on the form including 
completion of the health questionnaire portion of the form.
    c.  Sailor married to a non-military spouse, who then enlists or 
is commissioned in a uniformed service after 2 January 2013:
        (1) Existing FSGLI coverage for the spouse remains in place.
        (2) Newly commissioned or enlisted spouse must complete and 
submit the SGLV 8286A if desired to enroll the Sailor in FSGLI.
    d.  Military members married to each other, and one separates 
from service:
         (1) If the separating spouse has FSGLI coverage, no action 
is required.
         (2) If the separating spouse has no FSGLI coverage the 
Sailor must complete an SGLV 8286A should they desire FSGLI 
coverage for the spouse that separated from service.
