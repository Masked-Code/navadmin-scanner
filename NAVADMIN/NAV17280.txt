RMKS/1.  As directed in reference (a), the Chief of Chaplains is program 
sponsor for the professional development of Chaplain Corps
(CHC) officers and enlisted Religious Program Specialists (RP).  The Chief of 
Chaplains conducts annual short-course training for CHC officers and RPs to 
update essential techniques and practices in military ministry.  Pursuant to 
reference (b), this training enables chaplains to obtain continuing education 
units which may be required to maintain their credentials with their 
religious organizations.

2.  FY-18 professional development training will consist of a total of four 
days.  The Professional Development Training Workshop (PDTW), conducted the 
first day, focuses on Professional Naval Chaplaincy in line with reference 
(c).  All chaplains and RPs are expected to attend.

3.  The subsequent 3 day Professional Development Training Course
(PDTC) will address A Strategy for the Delivery of Religious Ministry to 
Nones, Dones, and Millennials.  The goal of the training is to provide 
chaplains and RPs with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to deliver 
meaningful religious ministry to those who express no religious preference, 
or antagonism towards religion and those who are characterized as the 
millennial generation.
