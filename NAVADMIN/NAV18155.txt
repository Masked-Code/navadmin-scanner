SUBJ/REVISION OF NAVAL ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION CODE G29A FROM AWV TO AWO//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN is to announce the automatic rating change of all 
Sailors that hold the G29A Naval enlisted classification code (NEC) from the 
Aircrewmen Avionics (AWV) rating into the Naval Aircrewmen Operator (AWO) 
rating.  This rating change is effective as follows:

        E3-E5:  1 JUL 2018
        E6:  1 SEP 2018
        E7-E9:  15 OCT 2018

2.  These changes are a result of an extensive review of current and future 
billet structures, personnel inventory, training pipelines and career paths.  
With the downsizing of legacy P-3C/EP-3 aircraft for the more advanced P-8A 
and MQ-4C aircraft, we are capitalizing upon the existing work requirements 
and training provided to holders of NEC G29A which are more closely aligned 
with the AWO rating than the AWV rating.  In line with the above timeline, 
all personnel holding or in training for NEC G29A shall be automatically 
converted to the AWO rating.  The following is the navy-wide exam 
administration schedule:

        E4-E6:  AWO Exam-SEP 18 Exam Cycle
        E7:  AWO Exam-JAN 19 Exam

The following is the E7 and E8/9 Selection Board Schedule:

        E7:  Summer 19 (FY20 Board)
        E8-E9:  Spring 19 (FY20 Board)

3.  This NAVADMIN does not modify any previous guidance concerning early 
separation, fleet reserve, conversion packages, or C-Way reenlistment 
requests.

4.  A frequently asked questions information sheet is posted on the enlisted 
community mangers webpage at http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/enlisted/community.
