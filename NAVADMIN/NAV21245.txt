2.  If a selected officer does not decline promotion in writing prior to the 
projected date of rank (noted above in paragraph 1), that officer is 
considered to have accepted the promotion on the date indicated.  An officer

reverted to enlisted status within 90 days of projected promotion date. 
 
3.  The commanding officer (CO), the Secretary of the Navy, or his designee, 
has the authority to delay projected promotions.  Upon the exercise of a 
delay, the officer shall be notified in writing before the effective date of 
the promotion, and not be tendered the promoting appointment.  The delay 
authority will immediately forward the notification of delay with supporting 
documentation to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-83), copy to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806). 
 
4.  COs are reminded of their responsibility to ensure the officers they are 
promoting are mentally, physically, morally and professionally qualified in 
accordance with title 10, U.S. Code 624. Per reference (a), officers are 
ineligible for promotion if they have failed the most recent Physical Fitness 
Assessment.  COs shall verify the promoting officer's information in the 
Physical Readiness Information Management System to ensure compliance with 
reference (a), as modified by reference (b), and delay the officers promotion 
in accordance with paragraph 3 of this NAVADMIN, if required. 
 
5.  Prepare a Delivery of Temporary/Permanent Appointment (NAVPERS form 
1421/7) (Rev 10-13).  Use this NAVADMIN as reference (a).  Use section 624 of 
title 10, U.S. Code as reference (b), for permanent lieutenants and 
above.  Use section 578 of title 10, U.S. Code as reference (b), for chief 
warrant officers.  Use sections 624 and 8139 of title 10, U.S. Code as 
reference (b), for limited duty officer promotion to lieutenant.  For limited 
duty officers, acceptance of the appointment is acceptance of permanent 
appointment as a limited duty officer.  Mail the completed form to 
COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806) or email via MNCC at askmncc@navy.mil. 
 
6.  Officers should review reference (c) for minimum time-in-grade 
requirements for purposes of voluntary retirement.  Full time support 
officers and those officers temporarily on active-duty anticipating release 
from active-duty under reference (d) may accept promotion without incurring 
any additional active-duty obligation.
