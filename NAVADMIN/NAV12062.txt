NARR/REF A IS THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012 
(NDAA 2012).  REF B IS 37 U.S.C. 310, SPECIAL PAY:  DUTY SUBJECT TO HOSTILE 
FIRE OR IMMINENT DANGER.  REF C IS A MEMO FROM OUSD (P&R), PRORATION OF

RMKS/1.  REF A AMENDED REF B TO REQUIRE THE PRORATION OF IMMINENT DANGER PAY 
(IDP).  PER REF C, THE DEFENSE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING SERVICE (DFAS) BEGAN 
PRORATING IDP ON 1 FEBRUARY 2012.  THE DELAY BETWEEN THE SIGNING OF REF A AND 
IMPLEMENTATION OF PRORATION BY REF C WAS DUE TO PAY SYSTEM CHANGES THAT WERE 
NECESSARY TO PRORATE IDP.  DUE TO THIS DELAY, SERVICE MEMBERS THAT RECEIVED 
IDP BETWEEN 31 DECEMBER 2011 AND 31 JANUARY 2012, BUT WERE NOT IN AN IDP-
ELIGIBLE AREA FOR THE ENTIRE PERIOD MAY HAVE BEEN OVERPAID.  NAVY WILL NOT 
RECOUP THIS OVERPAYMENT AND NO ACTION BY THE MEMBER IS REQUIRED.  HOWEVER, 
SERVICE MEMBERS MAY LOG ONTO THEIR MYPAY ACCOUNT TO SEE IF THEY HAVE BEEN 
AFFECTED.

2.  REF A REQUIRES PRORATION OF IDP SO THAT SERVICE MEMBERS ARE ONLY PAID FOR 
THE ACTUAL DAYS THEY PERFORM DUTY IN AN IDP-ELIGIBLE AREA.  PRIOR TO 31 
DECEMBER 2011, SERVICE MEMBERS RECEIVED THE FULL $225 PER MONTH EVEN IF THEY 
PERFORMED DUTY ONLY ONE DAY IN AN IDP-ELIGIBLE AREA.  REF A NOW AUTHORIZES 
SERVICE MEMBERS TO RECEIVE $7.50 FOR EACH DAY THEY ARE ON DUTY IN AN IDP-
ELIGIBLE AREA UP TO THE MAXIMUM MONTHLY RATE OF $225.  REF D OUTLINES 
QUALIFICATION CRITERIA AND LOCATIONS ELIGIBLE FOR IDP WHICH REMAIN UNCHANGED.   

3.  HOSTILE FIRE PAY (HFP):  SERVICE MEMBERS EXPOSED TO HOSTILE FIRE OR A 
HOSTILE MINE EXPLOSION EVENT ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE NON-PRORATED HFP IN THE 
FULL MONTHLY AMOUNT OF $225.  MEMBERS MAY NOT RECEIVE BOTH IDP AND HFP IN THE 
SAME MONTH. 
4.  NAVY IS WORKING WITH DFAS TO WAIVE OR REMIT DEBTS CREATED BY OVERPAYMENTS 
DURING THE PERIOD OF 31 DECEMBER 2011 TO 31 JANUARY 2012. SERVICE MEMBERS DO 
NOT NEED TO TAKE ANY ACTION REGARDING WAIVERS FOR JANUARY IDP AT THIS TIME.  
SERVICE MEMBERS ENTITLED TO PRO RATED IDP ARE ADVISED TO CHECK THEIR FEBRUARY 
LEAVE AND EARNINGS STATEMENTS TO ENSURE ACCURATE IDP ENTITLEMENTS ARE 
RECEIVED.  OVERPAYMENTS OF IDP FOR FEBRUARY WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY BE WAIVED 
AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO RECOUPMENT.

5.  COMMANDERS OF PERSONNEL ELIGIBLE FOR IDP OR HFP, AS DELINEATED IN REFS D 
AND E, ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SERVICING PERSONNEL SUPPORT DETACHMENTS (PSD) 
OR PERSONNEL OFFICES WITH ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION REGARDING IDP AND 
HFP QUALIFYING DUTY PERFORMED BY INDIVIDUALS OF THEIR UNIT.  SERVICE MEMBERS 
WHO PERFORM DUTY IN AN IDP-ELIGIBLE AREA ARE REMINDED TO KEEP TRACK OF ENTRY 
AND EXIT DATES TO VERIFY CORRECT PAYMENT OF IDP.
