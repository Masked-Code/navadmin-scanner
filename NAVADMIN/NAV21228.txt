4.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a promotion 
selection board via the Letter to the Board (LTB) process.  NAVADMIN 220/19 
announced the introduction of a new application known as Electronic 
Submission of Selection Board Documents (ESSBD), accessible through MyNavy 
Portal (MNP).  ESSBD improves the speed, transparency and confidence of 
receipt over current LTB submission methods, such as hard copy and e-mail 
submitted letters and related attachments. 
    a.  ESSBD will be available for all promotion, advancement and selection 
boards. 
    b.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to electronically 
submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without attachments and 
will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) exactly what will 
be delivered and presented to the board. 
    c.  To use ESSBD, candidates must access document services through MNP 
at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record.  On-screen instructions will 
direct the submitter thereafter. 
    d.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted.  If required, a full visual user 
guide is available at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-
promotion. 
    e.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command not later than 2359 
(central time) 10 days prior to the convening date of the respective 
board.  Submitters are cautioned to not wait until the deadline date to 
submit LTBs via ESSBD or other available avenues. 
 
Selection To               Convening Date       Due Date / Time 
Rear Admiral               16 NOV 21            05 NOV 21 / 2359 CT 
Rear Admiral (lower half)  17 NOV 21            06 NOV 21 / 2359 CT 
 
    f.  If sending a board package from a non-NMCI network 
(bumed.mil, eu.navy.mil, etc.), please review procedures listed in NAVADMIN 
220/19. 
    g.  The written communication may call attention to the board any matter 
concerning the record of the officer that the officer considers 
important.  Written communication may include, as enclosures, correspondence 
from any individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not 
originated by the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of 
the eligible officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must 
contain a written acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she 
desires such correspondence be presented to the board. Correspondence without 
such an acknowledgement is considered third- party correspondence and will be 
returned without being presented to the board.  Classified correspondence 
will not be accepted.
