RMKS/1. It is with great pleasure that I announce the selection of Joint 
Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story as the FY13 winner of the USS 
BAINBRIDGE (CGN 25) award for overall excellence in community service. In 
accordance with reference (a), this award recognizes a navy command that 
engaged in exemplary voluntary community service activities working with

have greatly impacted the lives of more tha 135,000 members of their

partnerships with local agencies, and dedication of more than 20,000 
volunteer hours to programs such as America goes back to school, Sailors feed 
the hungry and homeless, and Virginia Beach public schools beach bag program. 

2. The selection was highly competitive with the winner chosen from a field 
of 12 outstanding nominees. Each nominee is a winner within its own region. 
The top four nominees were extremely close, and I extend a well-deserved 
"bravo zulu" to Naval Air Station Pensacola, USS GEORGE WASHINGTON (CVN 73),
