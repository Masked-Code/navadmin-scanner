SPECIALISTS.  THE CHIEF OF CHAPLAINS CONDUCTS ANNUAL SHORT-COURSE TRAINING FOR 
CHAPLAIN CORPS OFFICERS AND RP'S TO UPDATE ESSENTIAL TECHNIQUES AND PRACTICES 
IN MILITARY MINISTRY.
THIS TRAINING ENABLES CHAPLAINS TO OBTAIN CONTINUING EDUCATION UNITS REQUIRED 
TO MAINTAIN FAITH-GROUP CREDENTIALS.

2.  THE FY11 PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING COURSE (PDTC) "PROFESSIONAL 
NAVAL CHAPLAINCY" WILL PROVIDE TRAINING TO CHAPLAINS AND RP'S THAT INTRODUCES 
THE CONCEPT OF PROFESSIONAL NAVAL CHAPLAINCY (PNC) RECOGNIZING THAT NAVAL 
CHAPLAINCY EXISTS IN THE OVERLAP OF FOUR DIFFERENT AREAS OF INTEREST.  ALONG 
ONE AXIS IS THE TENSION BETWEEN THE NAVY'S NEED TO EXERCISE AUTHORITY OVER ITS 
PEOPLE IN ORDER TO EXECUTE ITS MISSION AND THE CONCERNS RELIGIOUS 
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE FOR THE NEEDS OF ALL SERVICE MEMBERS, NOT JUST CHAPLAINS.  
ALONG THE SECOND AXIS IS THE TENSION BETWEEN THE CHAPLAIN AS RELIGIOUS 
MINISTRY PROFESSIONAL AND THE CHAPLAIN AS STAFF OFFICER.  THE PDTC 
PROFESSIONAL NAVAL CHAPLAINCY WILL EXPAND AND EXPLAIN THE COMPLEX 
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE CHAPLAIN CORPS, THE NAVAL CHAPLAIN AND RP, AND THOSE 
WITH WHOM THEY WORK AND ARE INTENDED TO SERVE.  USING THE LATEST ITERATION OF 
THE NAVY'S STRATEGIC PLAN FOR RELIGIOUS MINISTRIES AND THE CHIEF OF CHAPLAIN'S 
INSTRUCTION (COCINST) ON PROFESSIONAL NAVAL CHAPLAINCY AS ITS FOUNDATION, THE 
PDTC WILL ADDRESS THE REQUIREMENTS AND THE PRINCIPLES FOR ASSOCIATED POLICY, 
DEFINE THE TERMS AND MODELS RELATED TO PROFESSIONAL NAVAL CHAPLAINCY, AND 
IDENTIFY THE CURRENT AND FUTURE MECHANISMS USED TO DEVELOP A PROFESSIONAL 
NAVAL CHAPLAINCY COMMUNITY.
