RMKS/1. In anticipation of and consistent with expected OSD coordinated 
revisions to reference (a), this message provides amplifying policy and 
permanent exceptions to specific minimum Department of Defense (DoD) 
antiterrorism (AT) Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) standards in reference 
(a).  Exceptions described in this message are effective immediately.

2. Policy.  Any Navy project that requires adherence to reference (a) must be 
planned and designed to the minimum DoD AT standards unless the applicable 
geographic combatant commander (GCC) has established more stringent measures 
in higher threat environments.

3. Exceptions.  Requests to deviate above or below minimum DoD AT Standards 
must be submitted and approved by Office of the Chief of Naval Operations 
Shore Readiness Division (OPNAV N46) per references (b) through (d), unless 
the deviation is to meet more stringent GCC measures, per paragraph 2, or to 
enhance protection of defense critical infrastructure (DCI) as identified in 
the Navy Critical Asset Management System.  Deviations for higher GCC or DCI 
measures may be approved by the installation commanding officer.  For all 
other projects located more than 50 feet on the interior side of a controlled 
installation perimeter, the following permanent exceptions to reference (a) 
apply:
    a.	Standard 1:  Site plans and designs do not need to incorporate 
minimum standoff distances, as defined in reference (a).
    b.	Standard 2:  Unobstructed space must extend out 33 feet from the 
building.  Roadways and parking are allowed within this space.
    c.	Standard 6:  Existing buildings do not need to incorporate 
progressive collapse resistance, as defined in reference (a).
    d.	Standard 10:  Window systems, to include glazing, framing, 
connections, and supporting structural elements, do not have to be designed 
for blast resistance.  Neither dynamic analysis nor testing is required.  
Subparagraph B-3.1.7 of reference (a) applies for all exterior glazing.
    e.	Standard 12:  Door assemblies, to include doors, framing, 
fasteners and anchorage, do not have to be designed or tested for blast 
resistance.  Swinging exterior doors for inhabited areas must open outward.  
Exterior doors for inhabited areas that do not swing outward should be 
designed per subparagraph B-3.3.3 of reference (a) to mitigate the potential 
to be propelled into inhabited areas.  Glazing in and around exterior doors 
must comply with subparagraph 3d.

4. Implementation of this policy is mandatory for all projects planned for 
FY20 and beyond.  This policy does not relieve commanders of their 
responsibility to identify and submit deviation requests to incorporate 
unique AT measures associated with the project based on mission, conditions, 
and terrorist threat.

5. This policy remains in effect until superseded by a revision of reference 
(a).
