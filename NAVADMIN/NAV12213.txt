RMKS/1. PURPOSE OF THIS MESSAGE IS TWOFOLD: 1) ENSURE COMMANDS ARE AWARE OF 
AND COMPLYING WITH MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AND 2) DIRECT 
NAVY-WIDE MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING OF MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE AND CERTIFICATION 
EXAM COMPLETION STATUS TO COMMANDER, NAVAL SAFETY CENTER, NLT 15 OCT 2012. A 
MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE 
PROGRAM IS ONE OF SEVERAL TOOLS AIMED AT PROTECTING OUR SAILORS WHO ARE 
EXPOSED OR POTENTIALLY EXPOSED TO HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES IN THE WORKPLACE OR TO 
ENSURE THAT PERSONNEL ARE FIT ENOUGH TO PERFORM CERTAIN JOBS OR TASKS.

2. MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS: PER REFERENCES (A) AND (B), ALL 
COMMANDS SHALL UTILIZE THE MOST RECENT COMMAND BASELINE OR PERIODIC INDUSTRIAL 
HYGIENE (IH) SURVEY AS THE PRIMARY REFERENCE TO IDENTIFY PERSONNEL REQUIRING 
ENROLLMENT IN "EXPOSURE-BASED" MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS AND ENSURE THAT 
REQUIRED EXAMS ARE COMPLETED ON THE APPLICABLE SCHEDULE AS DESCRIBED IN 
REFERENCE (C) (THE "MEDICAL MATRIX"). ADDITIONALLY, COMMANDS SHALL ENSURE THAT 
APPLICABLE SPECIALTY "CERTIFICATION" EXAMS DETAILED IN CHAPTER 7 OF REFERENCE 
(C) ARE COMPLETED AS APPROPRIATE (AVIATION, FIREFIGHTERS, FOOD SERVICE WORKER, 
EXPLOSIVE HANDLERS, ETC.).
A. THE COMMAND MEDICAL DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVE (MDR) OR SAFETY 
MANAGER/OFFICER TYPICALLY MANAGES THE PROGRAM AND ASSISTS SUPERVISORS IN 
IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC WORKERS REQUIRING ENROLLMENT IN EXPOSURE- BASED AND 
SPECIALTY (CERTIFICATION) MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS.
B. MOST OPERATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COMMANDS WILL HAVE LESS THAN TEN 
APPLICABLE MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS HEARING 
CONSERVATION (NOISE), RESPIRATOR USER, AVIATION, FOOD SERVICE WORKER, HEAT 
STRESS, ETC. INDUSTRIAL COMMANDS SUCH AS MAINTENANCE DEPOTS AND SHIPYARDS WILL 
HAVE A GREATER NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS WHICH INCLUDE PROGRAMS SUCH AS LEAD, 
CADMIUM, ASBESTOS WORKER, METAL FUMES, WELDER, ISOCYANATES, LASER, ETC. 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INCLUSION IN PROGRAMS MAY BE BASED ON QUANTIFIED OR 
POTENTIAL HIGH EXPOSURES TO CHEMICAL OR PHYSICAL HAZARDS OR JOB-SPECIFIC 
REQUIREMENTS.
C. EXAMS CAN BE SCHEDULED THROUGH THE LOCAL SUPPORTING OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH 
CLINIC OR, IN SOME CASES, THE SUPPORTING MEDICAL DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVE 
(MDR). WHILE ALL COMMANDS SHOULD HAVE A BASELINE IH SURVEY AND RECEIVE 
PERIODIC SURVEY UPDATES ACCORDING TO TABLE 8-B OF REFERENCE (A), THOSE WITHOUT 
AN EXISTING BASELINE OR PERIODIC SURVEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY 
DETERMINE WHETHER APPLICABLE MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS ARE 
BEING MET AND THEREFORE SHOULD REQUEST A SURVEY FROM THE SUPPORTING IH OFFICE.
D. INFORMATION AND ADVICE TO HELP COMMANDS EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THEIR MEDICAL 
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THE SUPPORTING SAFETY, INDUSTRIAL 
HYGIENE, OR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH OFFICE.
ADDITIONAL MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM INFORMATION IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN THE 
MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE TOOLBOX AT THE LINK LISTED IN PARAGRAPH 3(A).

3. NAVY-WIDE MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING BASELINE ASSESSMENT: REFERENCE
(D) REQUIRES COMMANDERS, SUPERVISORS, AND MANAGERS TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT 
SAFETY AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH POLICIES AND PROGRAMS.
REFERENCES (E) AND (F) REQUIRE DOD COMPONENTS TO EVALUATE THE DEGREE TO WHICH 
MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE EXAMS AND AUDIOGRAMS, RESPECTIVELY, ARE OCCURRING. 
COMMANDERS MAY TRACK MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM COMPLIANCE BY ANY ELECTRONIC 
OR MANUAL METHOD SO LONG AS IT LISTS NAMES OF PERSONNEL REQUIRED TO BE IN EACH 
PROGRAM, LAST EXAM COMPLETION DATE, AND DUE DATE OF NEXT EXAM. TO FACILITATE 
THIS NAVY-WIDE EFFORT, THE FOLLOWING APPLIES:
A. ALL COMMANDS SHALL USE THE MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE EXAM COMPLETION REPORT 
SPREADSHEET LOCATED AT

STATUS AS OF 30 JUN 2012.  DETAILED REPORTING GUIDANCE IS DESCRIBED IN THE 
MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE EXAM COMPLETION REPORT INSTRUCTIONS WHICH ARE ALSO 
LOCATED AT THE LINK LISTED ABOVE.
B. COMMANDS SHALL DEVELOP THEIR "AS IS" BASELINE REPORT AND FORWARD TO THEIR 
ADMINISTRATIVE IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR IN COMMAND (ISIC).  UPON RECEIPT OF 
SUBORDINATE INPUTS, ISICS SHALL DEVELOP A CONSOLIDATED REPORT FOLLOWING THE 
INSTRUCTIONS IN THE LINK ABOVE AND FORWARD TO THE NEXT ADMINISTRATIVE ISIC IN 
THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.
C. CONSOLIDATED REPORTS ARE DUE, FROM SUBORDINATE COMMANDS, TO THE ECHELON III 
COMMANDER NLT 15 SEPT 2012.

REFLECT THIS NEW REQUIREMENT.

5. COMMANDERS MUST REMAIN PROACTIVE AND ENGAGED TO ENSURE IDENTIFICATION AND

ESSENTIAL TOOL IN HELPING TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR MILITARY AND CIVILIAN 
PERSONNEL.
