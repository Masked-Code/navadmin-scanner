SUBJ/STAND DOWN TASK FORCE WARRIOR//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS TASK FORCE WARRIOR HAS
WORKED DILIGENTLY TO PUT IN PLACE THE PROCESSES AND STRUCTURE
NECESSARY TO BRING SEA WARRIOR TO LIFE.  AS WE CONTINUE TO REALIGN
ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THIS IMPORTANT PART OF OUR VISION FOR THE
FUTURE, THE NEW MANPOWER, PERSONNEL, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION
ORGANIZATION HAS ASSUMED THIS ROLE.  CONSEQUENTLY, I STOOD DOWN TASK
FORCE WARRIOR ON 1 OCTOBER 2005.  THE SEA WARRIOR EXECUTION TEAM,
UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF VADM KEVIN MORAN, HAS ASSUMED FULL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DELIVERY OF THE SEA WARRIOR PRODUCT TO THE
FLEET.
2.  I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ENTIRE TASK FORCE WARRIOR TEAM FOR ITS
IMPRESSIVE EFFORT TRANSFORMING THE NAVY'S APPROACH TO DEVELOPING AND
DELIVERING TRAINED MANPOWER TO THE FLEET.  UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF
REAR ADMIRAL CRISP AND REAR ADMIRAL CONWAY, TASK FORCE WARRIOR
ESTABLISHED THE FOUNDATION FOR SEA WARRIOR AND SET THE STAGE FOR A
DRAMATIC STEP FORWARD IN THIS IMPORTANT PART OF MY VISION FOR OUR
NAVY IN THE 21ST CENTURY.
3.  RELEASED BY ADM MIKE MULLEN, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
