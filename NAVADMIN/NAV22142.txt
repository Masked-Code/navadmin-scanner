fulfilling obligated service requirements are encouraged to work

    a. Service members with an approved separation or retirement 
date on or before 31 March 2023 are eligible to submit a request to 
their detailer to have their separation or retirement date delayed 
and projected rotation date (PRD) extended, up to 30 September 2023, 
if the billet they are in upon submission of the request will be 
gapped upon their departure.  Requests to extend beyond 30 September 
2023 will be considered on a case by case basis for expected gaps in 
operational billets. 
    b.  All Service members interested in extending retirements are 
invited to apply to their PERS-40 detailer to have their PRD 
extended no later than 90 days prior to the start of their

sea duty and critical billets that would otherwise be gapped. 
    c.  In line with reference (f), Service members who are 
separating or retiring due to high year tenure (HYT) may apply for a

would otherwise be gapped, while maintaining the service members 
eligibility for advancement.  Those service members will submit a 
command-endorsed ePAR to MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) via MyNavy 
Portal or by emailing the ePAR request directly to 
askmncc(at)navy.mil.  Requests will be approved on a case by case 
basis. 
    d.  Service members with an approved separation or retirement 
date that are in a sea duty billet, will remain on sea duty if their 
request for voluntary extension is approved.

who are in billets that are eligible for Sea Duty Incentive Pay 
(SDIP), and who are approved for a voluntary extension that exceeds 
their prescribed sea tour by at least 12 months, will receive SDIP. 
        (2) Exceptions to the timeline to request SDIP and to the 
length of extension for SDIP will be granted by Enlisted 
Distribution Division (PERS-40) to accommodate these requests.  The 
latest SDIP eligibility chart can be found at
