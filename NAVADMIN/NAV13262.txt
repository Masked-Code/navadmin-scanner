STRESS CONTROL PROGRAM.  REF C IS THE COMBAT AND OPERATIONAL STRESS CONTROL 
PUBLICATION. 

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ESTABLISHES MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMAND LEVEL 
NAVY OPERATIONAL STRESS CONTROL (OSC) SKILLS TRAINING WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF 
DEPLOYING.  THIS TRAINING IS PROVIDED BY MOBILE TRAINING TEAMS (MTT).  IN 
SUPPORT OF NAVY'S 21ST CENTURY SAILOR INITIATIVE, LEADERS MUST BE ABLE TO 
ASSESS INDIVIDUAL AND UNIT STRESS, TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO MITIGATE 
STRESS ISSUES BEFORE THEY BECOME PROBLEMATIC, AND ELIMINATE NEGATIVE 
ATTITUDES ASSOCIATED WITH GETTING HELP.  BUILDING RESILIENCE AND MITIGATING 
STRESS IS A LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBILITY THAT DIRECTLY IMPACTS OUR WARFIGHTING 
READINESS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR NAVY. 

2.  EFFECTIVE 1 JANUARY 2014, COMMANDERS AND COMMANDING OFFICERS (COS) ARE 
DIRECTED TO SCHEDULE SPECIFIC OSC TRAINING FOR THEIR OFFICERS, CHIEFS, AND 
DECKPLATE LEADERS WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF DEPLOYMENT.  OSC MTTS WILL PRIORITIZE 
SCHEDULING OSC TRAINING WITH ALL DEPLOYING COMMANDS AT NO COST TO THE COMMAND 
TO MEET THE SIX MONTH OBJECTIVE.  MTTS TRAVEL BOTH WITHIN THE CONTINENTAL 
UNITED STATES-CONUS AND OUTSIDE THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES-OCONUS TO 
DELIVER TWO TARGETED COURSES; NAVY OSC-LEADER (NAVOSC-LEAD) FOR E7 AND ABOVE 
AND NAVY DECKPLATE LEADER OSC (DPL-OSC) FOR E4-E6 PERSONNEL. UNDERWAY 
TRAINING BY MTTS ARE AN OPTION.  COMMANDS SHOULD CONTACT ONE OF THE POINTS OF 
CONTACT LISTED IN PARAGRAPH 6 TO SCHEDULE COURSE(S). 
    A.  EACH COURSE, WHICH TAKES A HALF-DAY TO COMPLETE, PROVIDES OFFICER AND 
ENLISTED LEADERS TRAINING AND PRACTICAL TOOLS TO RECOGNIZE AND MITIGATE 
STRESS AND PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLNESS, STRENGTH, AND RESILIENCE IN 
SAILORS AND COMMANDS.  THE COURSES ARE INTERACTIVE, FACILITATED DISCUSSIONS 
FOCUSED ON LEADERS' RESPONSIBILITIES IN MAINTAINING THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL 
WELLNESS OF THEIR PERSONNEL. 
    B.  COURSE SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT UPON DEMONSTRATED SUPPORT FROM COMMAND 
LEADERS.  THIS IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR UNIT PERSONNEL TO BE TOGETHER IN 
ONE LOCATION TO DISCUSS REAL ISSUES IN AN INFORMAL SETTING. 
    C.  COMMANDS WILL DOCUMENT COMPLETION OF NAVOSC-LEAD AND DPL-OSC TRAINING 
IN THE FLEET TRAINING MANAGEMENT AND PLANNING SYSTEM (FLTMPS) PRIOR TO 
DEPLOYMENT. 

3.  COMMANDERS AND COS WILL ENSURE MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION WITH AT LEAST 75 
PERCENT OF OFFICERS, CHIEFS AND E4-E6 PERSONNEL COMPLETING TRAINING WITHIN A 
SIX-MONTH WINDOW PRIOR TO DEPLOYING. 
    A.  CLASS SIZES FOR BOTH COURSES SHOULD BE LIMITED TO 35-50 PARTICIPANTS 
TO ENHANCE THE TRAINING EXPERIENCE.  COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO SCHEDULE 
MULTIPLE SESSIONS OF BOTH COURSES AS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE REQUIRED 
NUMBER OF PERSONNEL RECEIVE TRAINING. 
    B.  TO ENSURE THE BEST USE OF LIMITED RESOURCES, COS SHALL ENSURE THE 
NUMBER OF PERSONNEL ATTENDING TRAINING IS WITHIN 90 PERCENT OF WHAT WAS 
COMMITTED WHEN COURSES WERE SCHEDULED WITH MTTS. 

4.  MTTS WILL PROVIDE EACH PARTICIPANT AN ANONYMOUS QUESTIONNAIRE BEFORE THE 
BEGINNING OF EACH COURSE AND AN EVALUATION AT THE END OF EACH COURSE TO 
UNDERSTAND PARTICIPANT ATTITUDES, SOURCES, LEVELS, AND PERCEPTIONS ABOUT 
STRESS.  TO MEASURE COURSE RETENTION, EFFECTIVENESS IS SURVEYED THROUGH A 
SIX-MONTH FOLLOW-UP EMAIL QUESTIONNAIRE. 

5.  COMPLETION OF EITHER "NAVOSC-LEAD" OR "DPL-OSC" MEETS AND EXCEEDS THE 
ANNUAL GENERAL MILITARY TRAINING REQUIREMENT FOR OSC - SUPERVISORY (CPPD-GMT-
OSCS-1.0) OR OSC NON-SUPERVISORY (CPPD-GMT-OSCNS-1.0) COURSES.  TO MINIMIZE 
REDUNDANT TRAINING, INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATING IN NAVOSC-LEAD MAY RECEIVE 
CREDIT FOR COMPLETING CPPD-GMT-OSCS-1.0 COURSE AND INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATING 
IN DPL-OSC MAY RECEIVE CREDIT FOR COMPLETING CPPD-GMT-OSCNS-1.0 COURSE AS 
LONG AS TRAINING WAS COMPLETED IN THE SAME FISCAL YEAR. 

6.  MTTS ALONG WITH SELECTED PERSONNEL UNDER COMMANDER, NAVY EXPEDITIONARY 
COMBAT COMMAND ARE THE ONLY PERSONNEL SPECIFICALLY TRAINED AND CERTIFIED TO 
PROVIDE NAVOSC-LEAD AND DPL-OSC AS DIRECTED BY THIS NAVADMIN.  MTTS ARE PRE-
POSITIONED ON THE EAST AND WEST COASTS SPECIFICALLY TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS 
FOR OSC LEADER TRAINING, BOTH IN CONUS AND OCONUS.
