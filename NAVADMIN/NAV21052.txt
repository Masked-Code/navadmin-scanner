and provides updated references and additional procedures for foreign 
visitors to U.S. Navy facilities based on new requirements for COVID-19 to 
include testing prior to entry into the U.S. from a foreign country, as 
directed by references (b) and outlined in references (c) thorugh (e). 
 
2.  Foreign visits are authorized but must adhere to guidance established for 
U.S. travel in reference (d) and the travel procedure requirements in 
accordance with (IAW) references (b) through (f).  All foreign personnel 
traveling from outside the U.S. to visit a U.S. Navy command will be required 
to complete a 14 day restriction of movement (ROM) period upon arrival in the 
U.S. Additionally, all foreign personnel traveling to the U.S. from a foreign 
country, are required to have a negative viral COVID-19 test (molecular or 
antigen) IAW procedures outlined for U.S. personnel in reference (b). Foreign 
visitors must possess, and present on request, proof of a negative viral 
COVID-19 test administered within 72 hours of embarkation for international 
travel to the U.S.  Valid proof may be electronic or printed for commercial 
flights. 
 
3.  COVID-19 travel information for travelers entering the U.S. may be found 
on the Department of State website 
(https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/ 
covid-19-information.html). 
 
4.  Foreign personnel already in the U.S. in a location categorized as red in 
either factor 1 or 2 as per MyNavyPortal travel tracker 
(https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/don-covid-19-travel-tracker) will be required 
to complete a 14 day ROM period prior to visiting a U.S. Navy command outside 
a 50 mile radius of their location. If a 14 day ROM period cannot be 
completed, a Foreign Visit Requests (FVR) waiver will be required.  All other 
FVRs will be processed as per normal procedures.  CNO has delegated waiver 
approval authority to OPNAV N3/N5 for FVRs to U.S. Navy commands. 
 
5.  Waivers will only be considered if requesting command provides written 
determination that the FVR is mission essential.  Requesting commands will 
provide the following information to the points of contact via email at least 
seven days in advance of the visit: FVR number; name of visitor; country 
represented; dates and purpose of visit; and, recommendation with 
justification.  Commanding officers, officers-in-charge, or civilian 
equivalent directors must endorse waiver request submissions. 
 
6.  Travelers with valid proof of COVID-19 vaccination are currently not 
exempt from the testing requirement nor the FVR waiver requirement, however, 
proof of vaccination will be considered as part of mitigating factors for a 
waiver. 
 
7.  Within two days of any foreign visit, host commands will make contact 
with the foreign visitor or embassy representative to confirm the visitor is 
not symptomatic as per reference (f) (e.g., temperature over 100.4 degrees 
Fahrenheit, fever, cough, breathing difficulty, loss of taste or smell).  If 
symptomatic or confirmed COVID-19 positive, the visit must be canceled or 
postponed.

jeffrey.roman(at)navy.mil and Mark Galvin at mark.galvin.ctr(at)navy.mil.
