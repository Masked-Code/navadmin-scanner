SUBJ/ALIGNMENT OF THE NUCLEAR LIMITED DUTY OFFICER DESIGNATOR.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the realignment of the nuclear power limited 
duty officer (LDO) designator within the 62XX series. This NAVADMIN will 
serve as an interim change to SECNAVINST 1400.1B, Officer Competitive 
Categories for the Active-Duty List of the Navy and Marine Corps.  A revision 
to the instruction will be forwarded by separate correspondence.

same designator series, the Secretary of the Navy has approved alignment of

accessions, career management, and the distribution of LDOs within the 
submarine enterprise.

620X nuclear power (disestablishes 640X).
