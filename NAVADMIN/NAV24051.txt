RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a) and cancels reference (b).  
References (c) through (f) will be updated in CY 2024 to reflect changes from 
this NAVADMIN.

2.  I am releasing Culture of Excellence 2.0 (COE 2.0), the foundation by 
which our Navy builds its Warfighters - our People, Leaders, and Teams - as a 
key enabler of delivering the decisive combat power I talked about in 
"America's Warfighting Navy."  COE

2.0, empowered by the "Get Real, Get Better" (GRGB) call to think, act, and 
operate differently, will advance our approach to building our warfighters 
and warfighting Teams.  We are taking the best parts of what has made our 
Navy great and building upon them.

3.  This is not a new requirement.  Rather COE 2.0 simplifies, streamlines, 
and aligns several Navy programs and concepts into an actionable approach for 
building great culture, providing new tools for Command Triads to better 
understand and act on the needs of their People.  In doing so, we will raise 
the level of our lowest- performing commands and make our best commands even 
better.
COE 2.0 will prepare us to operate in uncertain, complex, and rapidly 
changing environments by ensuring every member of the Navy Team has the 
opportunity to become Forged by the Sea:  becoming the best version of 
themselves and doing the most valuable work of their lives alongside Sailors 
and civilians they trust and respect.
With the right tools, such as COE 2.0, a winning mindset, and the highest 
levels of integrity, we will operate safely as a Team to deliver warfighting 
excellence.  America is counting on us to do so.

4.  We have been working with leadership at all levels from across the entire 
Navy - both at sea and ashore - over the past year to lay the foundation for 
the COE 2.0 launch.  This includes:
    a.  Mental Health Playbook V1.1, reference (g).  Supports command leaders 
in preventing mental health issues from occurring and, when they do, to 
connect Sailors with the proper mental health care, at the right level, at 
the right time.
    b.  MILPERSMAN 1320-307, Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Warm- Handoff, 
reference (h).  Ensures Command Triads maintain an unbroken chain of 
supervision as a Sailor with known challenges or issues transfers from one 
command to another.
    c.  NAVADMIN 006/24, Policy for the Assignment of Pregnant Sailors and 
Sailors Who Experience Perinatal Loss, reference (i).
Improves Sailors' ability to balance family and career goals and gives them 
some flexibility in assignments for continued career advancement, including 
the option to PCS to another geographic location to fill a critical gap 
ashore.
    d.  Suicide Related Behavior Response and Postvention Guide, reference 
(j).  Provides command leaders a streamlined reference to manage suicide 
crisis response, suicide related behavior response, reintegration, and 
suicide postvention, to include Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC) 
responsibilities.
    e.  NAVADMIN 037/24, Establishment of Navy Women's Initiative Team (Navy-
WIT), reference (k).  Broadens awareness and influences policy to support the 
recruitment and retention of women by building communities, developing best 
practices, discussing opportunities and recommending policy and program 
changes to remove barriers.

5.  Navy Culture and Force Resilience Office website.  This website supports 
hyperlinks from the COE 2.0 playbook, and has additional instructions, 
messages, and policies which will be regularly updated for easy consultation.  
COE 2.0 products are available at
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/Culture-Resilience/Culture-of-
Excellence/, and there are three entry points for every Sailor to access COE 
2.0:
    a.  COE 2.0 Placemat, reference (l).  The front of the COE 2.0 placemat 
sets the standard for "what right looks like," where our shared Core Values 
and Warrior Toughness are the starting point for a winning mindset from which 
we build great people, great leaders, and great teams.  The back of the COE 
2.0 placemat is a self- assessment tool for foundational programs, moving 
beyond checklists and towards outcomes that make a difference.
    b.  Forged by the Sea:  COE 2.0 Playbook, reference (m).  The Playbook 
aligns existing Navy programs into an approach for building a cultural 
foundation, to include one-pagers for key programs.

6.  In support of COE 2.0, the following tools are now available to every 
Navy command:
    a.  Warrior Toughness Placemat, reference (n).  Navy is combining Warrior 
Toughness (taught at Recruit Training since 2018) and Expanded-Operational 
Stress Control (taught Fleet-wide since
2020) into one continuum.  This placemat is the first step in that process, 
outlining a series of skills scientifically proven to enhance personal and 
team performance, toughness, and resilience.
    b.  Virtual CO's suggestion box.  Page 33 of reference (m) describes the 
QR code CO's suggestion box that can be employed alongside the traditional 
physical box.  This anonymous feedback is only available to the command triad 
and is automatically deleted every 90 days.  To request a virtual suggestion 
box, a member of the command triad can scan the QR code on page 33 or go to 
https://usnavy.gov1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cx3MPZ0dS6OX0V0.
    c.  Commander's Risk Mitigation Dashboard (CRMD).  Page 34 of reference 
(m) introduces CRMD, a new tool for commanders to better understand the risk 
of destructive behaviors within their commands, enabling them to take 
appropriate action.  Command leadership can scan the QR code on page 34 to 
get access for their command.

7.  Today's release of COE 2.0 is the first step in an enduring process of 
continuous evaluation and improvement, and we will provide updates to Culture 
and Force Resilience resources, policy, and processes as needed.  In the 
coming months, the following resources will be made available:
    a.  Navy will release an updated necessary conversations guide, providing 
all hands with tools to better listen and understand each other, especially 
those with a different background than their own, including age.
    b.  The Navy Leader Development Framework, reference (o), will be updated 
to reflect the "Great Leaders" column of the COE 2.0 placemat, including 
those leadership behaviors initially rolled out as part of GRGB.
    c.  Navy will build on reference (p) and provide updated guidance for the 
CY24 Command Climate Assessment (CCA) annual window.  This will include a 
revised template for conducting the ISIC debrief and the ability for every 
Navy command to leverage additional survey tools to better listen to their 
people, take corrective actions, and better their quality of service.
    d.  Supporting instructions will be revised to incorporate COE 2.0.

8.  During this month's Naval Flag Officer/Senior Executive Service/ Senior 
Enlisted Leader conference, specific tasks will be provided to Navy leaders 
as part of the broader COE 2.0 rollout.  These tasks include:  Highlighting 
leaders and commands in their community that best embody the tenets of COE 
2.0; providing best practices that build COE 2.0; and providing vignettes and 
training plans that explain COE 2.0 using the language of our Navy's 
communities, at all ranks E1 to O10.

9.  Closing Thoughts.  Our Navy's mission could not be more significant or 
consequential in this decisive decade.  COE 2.0 is central to investing in 
the warfighters needed for mission success.
I am proud to serve alongside you, and I thank you and your families for what 
you do every day to support our Navy and our Nation.

10.  Point of contact is OPNAV N172, who can be reached via e-mail at 
n17coe@us.navy.mil.

11.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.

12.  Admiral Franchetti sends, 33rd Chief of Naval Operations.//
