RMKS/1. THE NAVY AND OUR NATION LOST ONE OF OUR HEROES LAST WEEK WITH THE 
PASSING OF NEIL ARMSTRONG.  MR. ARMSTRONG WAS AN OUTSTANDING CITIZEN AND 
PATRIOT WHO SERVED OUR GREAT NATION IN UNIFORM FOR 22 YEARS. HE WAS A 
DEDICATED HUSBAND, FATHER, GRANDFATHER, AND SHIPMATE, WHOSE LEGACY LEFT AN 
INDELIBLE MARK ON ALL HE TOUCHED. WE PAUSE AND CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF AN 
AMERICAN HERO.

EARNED HIS GOLD WINGS AS A NAVAL AVIATOR. ASSIGNED TO VF-51, HE MADE HIS FIRST 
FLIGHT IN A F9F-2B PANTHER IN JANUARY 1951, AND IN JUNE MADE HIS FIRST JET 
CARRIER LANDING ON BOARD THE USS ESSEX AND SET SAIL FOR KOREA. IN SEPTEMBER

3. AFTER RESIGNING FROM THE NAVAL SERVICE, MR. ARMSTRONG JOINED THE NASA 
ASTRONAUT CORPS IN SEPTEMBER 1962 WHERE HE MADE TWO SPACE FLIGHTS. HIS FIRST 
SPACE FLIGHT WAS IN 1966 AS COMMAND PILOT OF THE GEMINI 8 MISSION. HIS SECOND, 
AND MOST FAMOUS SPACE FLIGHT, WAS IN JULY OF 1969 AS MISSION COMMANDER OF THE 
APOLLO 11 LUNAR LANDING MISSION. ON 20 JULY, AFTER A NEARLY 250,000-MILE 
JOURNEY TO THE MOON, MR. ARMSTRONG PILOTED AND LANDED THE LUNAR MODULE EAGLE 
ON THE LUNAR SURFACE AND LATER BECAME THE FIRST PERSON TO SET FOOT ON THE 
MOON.
MR. ARMSTRONG'S ICONIC PHRASE: "THAT'S ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN, ONE GIANT LEAP 
FOR MANKIND" INSPIRED GENERATIONS TO LOOK SKYWARD AND TURN DREAMS INTO 
REALITY. FOR HIS SERVICE AT NASA, HE WAS AWARDED PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF 
FREEDOM, THE CONGRESSIONAL SPACE MEDAL OF HONOR AND THE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD
