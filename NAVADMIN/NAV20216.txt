EXAM REVISED BUSINESS RULES.  
REF B IS NAVADMIN 167/20, SEPTEMBER 2020 (CYCLE 107) NAVY-WIDE ADVANCEMENT

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN amends references (a) and (b) by modifying the 
Professional Military Knowledge Eligibility Exam (PMK-EE) due date 
requirement for Navy-Wide Advancement Examination (NWAE) Cycles 248 and 107. 
The revised deadline is now 31 August 2020.

2.  Due to technical issues, which may have hindered Sailors ability to be 
marked as PMK-EE complete in the Fleet Management and Planning System 
(FLTMPS), all E4-E6 candidates, who are required to complete PMK-EE in order 
to participate in the Cycle 248 Active Duty and Full Time Support NWAE, and 
the Cycle 107 Selected Reserve NWAE, are granted a PMK-EE due date extension 
to 31 August 2020.  As a reminder, PMK-EE is only required to be completed 
once per paygrade, not every cycle.

3.  For additional information about PMK-EE, go to the MyNavy Portal
(MNP) at https://my.navy.mil, select Career & Life Events, Advancement and 
Promotion page, then scroll down and click on the PMK-EE link.  There you can 
download PMK-EE Smart Sheet detailed supplemental guidance.

4.  For questions about PMK-EE that are not answered by visiting MNP, contact 
the MyNavy Career Center Help Desk at 1-833-330-6622, or via email at 
askmncc(at)navy.mil.

5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
