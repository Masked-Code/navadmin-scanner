RMKS/1.  This message is an interim change to reference (a) and publishes the 
Bill of Rights and Responsibilities for residents of Navy Unaccompanied

Sailors is a fundamental right.  Likewise, maintaining cleanliness of UH and 
identifying and reporting deficiencies are the responsibilities of both our 
Sailors and the chain of command.

2.  The Navy is committed to ensuring that UH residents are knowledgeable of 
their rights and responsibilities regarding quality housing and fair 
treatment while residing in government-owned and controlled UH.  This bill of 
rights and responsibilities (BOR&R) outlines what expectations and

appliances, and utilities;
    c.  The right to verify the condition and cleanliness of the assigned 
room, shared space (if applicable), and the furnishings provided during 
check-in and check-out inspections;
    d.  The right to clearly defined regulations regarding occupancy of UH 
and use of common areas and amenities; and
    e.  The right to report inadequate housing standards or deficits in 
habitability of the housing unit to the UH staff, housing management office, 
and the chain of command without fear of:
        (1) reprisal or retaliation;
        (2) decreased services or increased obligations as a Resident;
        (3) interference with right to privacy or harassment as a Resident;
        (4) refusal to honor the terms of occupancy; or
        (5) interference with the career of a Resident.

4.  The Resident Responsibilities for government-controlled UH are as 
follows:
    a.  The responsibility to take pride and ownership of your assigned 
quarters, common areas, and amenities, and to comply with UH Rules and 
Regulations.
    b.  The responsibility to maintain Daily Living Standards in accordance 
with the Welcome Aboard Handbook.

Resident BOR &R into all UH Welcome Aboard/ New Resident Orientation 
Handbooks.
