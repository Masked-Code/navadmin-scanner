3.  For promotion to the grade of lieutenant, an All-Fully- Qualified-
Officers List (AFQOL) consisting of those officers recommended for promotion 
on their most recent fitness reports will be sent to the SECNAV, who will 
certify the AFQOL and forward the list to the Secretary of Defense.  Those 
officers determined not fully qualified for promotion will be omitted from 
the AFQOL, constituting a failure of selection.  The All-Fully-Qualified 
(AFQ) standard applies to all designators.  The AFQ standard will also be 
utilized for any officers administratively missed when the original lists 
were compiled.

4.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a promotion selection board.  
Written communication may invite to the attention of the board any matter 
concerning himself or herself that the officer considers important.  The 
written communication must be in accordance with MILPERSMAN 1420-010 
(Communication with Officer Promotion Selection Boards) and may include, as 
enclosures, correspondence from any individual concerning the eligible 
officer.
Correspondence not originated by the eligible officer, including endorsements 
to the officer letters, and letters written on behalf of that officer, must 
contain a written acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she 
desires that such correspondence be presented to the board.  Correspondence 
without such acknowledgment is considered third party correspondence and will 
not be accepted.
Correspondence must arrive no later than 10 calendar days before the 
convening date of the board.  In line with NAVADMIN 220/19 (Electronic 
Submission of Letters to Promomtion and Selection Boards through MyNavy 
Portal), electronic submission of selection board documents (ESSBD) is the 
preferred method of submitting a letter to the board (LTB).  To utilize 
ESSBD, candidates must access document services through MyNavy Portal at 
http://mnp.navy.mil/group/myrecord.  On-screen instructions will direct the 
submitter thereafter.  Submissions should be prepared with attachments (if 
applicable), prior to initiating the LTB in ESSBD.  There is no save and 
return function between sessions.
Submitters will receive an e-mail confirmation regarding the status of their 
LTB.  If ESSBD is unavailable, LTBs may be submitted via postal mail or 
encrypted e-mail to the MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) and shall be addressed 
to:  Navy Personnel Command (NPC) MyNavy Career Center (MNCC), President FY-
21 Navy Reserve, (Grade), (Line or Staff Corps, as applicable) Promotion 
Selection Board, Board #XXX, (Board number is a required field and may be 
found on the FY-
21 selection board schedule located at
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/selectionboardsupport/Pages/FY-20-Board-Schedule.aspx),
5720 Integrity Drive, Millington, TN 38055-6300.  To check on receipt of your 
package, go to http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/reserveofficer/Pages/default.aspx or call the MNCC at 833-330-MNCC 
(6622) or askmncc(at)navy.mil.

5.  Officers in the grades of lieutenant, lieutenant commander and commander 
are elgible for consideration for promotion only if they have served 
continuously on either the RASL or Active-Duty List (or a combination of both 
lists) during the one-year period ending on the date of the convening of the 
promotion board.  Accordingly, officers returning to an active status from a 
period of inactive or broken service (USNR-S2, discharge) are eligible for 
consideration for promotion only after continuously serving in an active 
status for one full year.  Membership in the Individual Ready Reserve does 
not qualify for deferment of eligibility for consideration.

6.  All officers are reminded it is their responsibility to ensure their 
personnel records are substantially accurate and complete.

7.  The cscselboard(at)navy.mil mailbox account is capable of receiving 
encrypted correspondence in line with Department of Defense policy.  If you
