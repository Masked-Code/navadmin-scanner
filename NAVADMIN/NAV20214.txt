SUBJ/CNO USS INDIANAPOLIS (CA 35) MESSAGE TO THE FLEET//

RMKS/1.  On 30 July 1945, just 3 minutes after midnight, the heavy cruiser 
USS INDIANAPOLIS (CA 35) was struck by two Japanese torpedoes in the dark of 
night while conducting a solo transit of the Philippine Sea.  Despite their 
best efforts, the ship went down in 12 short minutes.  While around 900 of 
the 1,195-member crew escaped the ship that night, tragically only 316 were 
rescued.

2.  While much is written about the crews four harrowing days in the waters 
of the Pacific waiting to be found with few lifeboats, over-exposure to the 
elements, and almost no food or water, one thing is certain: those brave 
Sailors and Marines endured impossible hardships by banding together.  And we 
must do the same today.

3.  So, I ask you to pause and take a moment between 1103 - 1115 EDT to 
remember the brave Sailors and Marines of INDIANAPOLIS.  Remember their 
courage and devotion to each other in the face of the most severe adversity.  
Remember their valor in combat and the role they played in ending the most 
devastating war in history.  Honor their memory and draw strength from their 
legacy.

4.  America. Has. A. Great. Navy.  Our nation counts on you and so do I.  
Never more proud to be your CNO.

5.  Released by Admiral Mike Gilday, Chief of Naval Operations.//
