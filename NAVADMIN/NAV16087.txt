RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels and supersedes REF A.  This message 
establishes a new completion date for Fiscal Year 2016 (FY16) Cybersecurity 
(CS) awareness training and provides additional options for afloat units to 
accomplish required training.

2. All Department of the Navy military, civilians, and contractors with 
access to Unclassified and Secret networks must complete the Department of 
Defense Cyber Awareness Challenge (DoD CAC) Version Three (V3) by 30 
September 2016 to satisfy FY16 General Military Training requirements.

3. All Department of the Navy military, civilians, and contractors with 
access to information and information systems that process, store, and/or 
transmit Sensitive Compartmented Information applicable to both those 
connected to the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System or 
standalone as well as those directly supporting Director of Naval 
Intelligence initiatives must complete DoD IC CAC V2 to satisfy FY16 GMT 
requirements by 30 September 2016.  These personnel do not have to complete 
DoD CAC V3.

4.  Authorized methods for training delivery:
       a.  Total Workforce Management Service (TWMS), 
https://twms.navy.mil/selfservice/login.asp;
       b.  Navy e-Learning (NEL) via the Navy Knowledge Online portal;
       c.  CAC V3 is available at:  
http://iatraining.disa.mil/eta/cyberchallenge_v3_fy15/launchPage.htm
       d.  IC-CAC V2 is available at:  
http://iatraining.disa.mil/eta/cyberchallenge/launchpage.htm
       e.  Other approved training sources, include general military lectures 
delivered by a certified Information Security Systems Managers (ISSM) and 
Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Digital Video Discs.

5. Ships can access the annual training from the Navy e-Learning afloat (NEL) 
application hosted on the Navy Information/Application Product Suite (NIAPS) 
server, eliminating the need to reach back to shore hosted NEL websites. 
Download LMS_Pub Amendment 95 using the normal (manual) NIAPS DS_Update 
process. If unable to download LMS_Pub Amendment 95, ships can request a DVD 
with these files be shipped by submitting a support request to Navy 311.  
Additionally, DoD CAC V3 on CDs will be available for online order from DISA 
in three to four weeks.  To pre-order them now, download and submit a DoD IA 
Training and Awareness Product order form from 
http://iasecontent.disa.mil/eta/products_order_form.pdf.  Include a written 
note in the comments section to ask for "Cyber Awareness Challenge" Version 
3.0 CDs, when available.

6.  Although, CS awareness training is an individual responsibility, 
Commanders and Commanding Officers are accountable for 100 percent 
certification of their personnel.  Echelon II Command ISSM and training 
officers are responsible for tracking and reporting compliance to meet annual 
Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 requirements.

7.  Command training officers must validate training via the TWMS or Fleet 
Training Management and Planning System,
(https://ntmpsweb.ncdc.navy.mil/Fltmps/) authoritative database.  Training 
officers will manually input training completed via NEL or AILE.  Report 
discrepancies to the Navy Training Management Planning System Operational 
Support office at ntmps.support(AT)navy.mil or 1-866-438-2898/DSN 922-1867.

8.  Echelon II training officers are responsible for maintaining a list of 
personnel which have fulfilled the training requirement in addition to  
compiling data in TWMS for their respective area of responsibility.  The 
command ISSM shall disable the accounts of users who fail to complete the 
training by 30 September 2016.

9. This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.

10. Released by VADM Ted N. Branch, Deputy Chief of Naval Operation for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
