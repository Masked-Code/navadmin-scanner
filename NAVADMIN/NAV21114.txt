RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN informs eligible Service Members that the Blended 
Retirement System (BRS) mid-career Continuation Pay (CP) rates for calendar 
year (CY) 2022 have been released.  Please visit MyNavy Portal (MNP) 
at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/pay-and-benefits to view the CY-22 CP pay 
rates memorandum. 
 
2.  In line with references (a) and (b), Service Members who want to receive 
the mid-career CP are reminded that they must be enrolled in BRS and request 
CP before 12 years of service (YOS).  The CP election is made via Navy 
Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) which can be accessed via MyNavy 
Portal Quick Links.  For Service Members who have provided NSIPS with an up-
to-date e-mail address, NSIPS will send an e-mail notification of CP 
eligibility at 11 years six months YOS, 11 years nine months YOS and a final 
reminder at 11 years 11 months YOS.  Service Members who are unable to elect 
CP through NSIPS may manually elect CP through their Command Career Counselor 
(CCC).  CP information to include details on electing CP can be found in 
references (c) and (d).  For any other CP issues, Service Members should 
reach out to MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) at 833-330-MNCC or 
askmncc(at)navy.mil. 
 
3.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
