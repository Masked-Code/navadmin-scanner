RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN introduces the Rapid Assess and Incorporate Software 
Engineering in a Day (RAISED) process, which is the Risk Management Framework
(RMF) for agile software based systems.  The RAISED process takes advantage 
of lessons learned from the Air Force Continuous Authorization process, 
Department of Defense (DoD) Software Assurance, and Industry best practices 
for Development Security Operations (DEVSECOPS) to enable the modernization 
of applications and significantly reduce RMF workload and timelines.  In 
anticipation of transition to RAISED framework later this year, application 
owners should review the RAISED guidance contained in the RMF Process Guide 
and RAISED Playbook which are posted to the following location:
https://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs/OPNAV/N2N6/DDCION/N2N6BC1/ArchGovPolicy
/RAISED/Forms/AllItems.aspx.


2.  RAISED utilizes the Assess and Incorporate process under the Assess Only 
construct established in reference (a).  For applications that are within 
established risk tolerance levels, the Assess Only construct incorporates 
applications into the hosting system/enclaves existing authorization boundary 
without changing the security posture or level of risk, precluding the need 
for a separate authorization.  By leveraging the defined development process, 
shared infrastructure, and automated security testing, it allows applications 
to utilize a reduced security control set and streamlined assessment process.  
RAISED is focused on streamlining the RMF approval processes, with the 
ultimate goal of assessing and deploying RMF approved applications as needed 
to meet Fleet operational requirements.


3.  The RAISED workflows and reduced security control set are being finalized 
by the offices of the Navy Authorizing Official (NAO) and Navy Information 
Warfare Systems Command (NAVWAR) with an anticipated completion in January 
2020.  The request to develop the RAISED workflows will be submitted to 
Defense Information Systems Agency upon OPNAV N2N6 approval.
    a.  Upon approval of the revised workflows and reduced security control 
set, NAVWAR will test the RAISED concept by using established workflows and 
RAISED methods and procedures to assess and approve a DEVSECOPS containerized 
application for deployment.  RAISED workflows will be manually implemented 
during this testing period.  The objective of this test is to validate the 
ability of the RAISED process to accelerate the RMF assessment and approval 
process, validate methods and procedures, and incorporate lessons learned.
    b.  The anticipated availability of the RAISED Enterprise Mission 
Assurance Support Service (eMASS) workflows for program use is the 3rd 
quarter of fiscal year 2020.  Criteria for determining application 
suitability will be provided when the RAISED process is officially approved 
for use.


4.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.
