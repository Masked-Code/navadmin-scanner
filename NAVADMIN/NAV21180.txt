RMKS/1.  This message supersedes reporting guidance in refs (a) and (b), 
and supplements reporting guidance in ref (c) for COVID-19 reporting only, 
making vaccination status a required field for all military personnel.  In 
order to track the efficacy of our vaccine against the COVID delta variant, 
daily roll-up should include: vaccination/immunization status, 
symptomatic/asymptomatic status, why tested.  The updated mass-upload excel 
file includes vaccination status as a required field and will be downloaded 
and used by all unit level commands no later than 03 September 2021. 
 
2.  OPREP-3 Navy Blue Message traffic is required in addition to sharepoint 
reporting for 1) COVID-19 deaths, 2) media interest events, 3) COVID positive 
cases while at sea regardless of vaccine status, and/or 4) significant 
operational impacts. 
 
3.  Reporting via OPNAV SharePoint site is required by all commands for all 
COVID cases for all military, civilians, dependents, and contractors.  Once 
entered, commands are required to update changes in case status via the OPNAV 
SharePoint site within 24 hours.  An updated mass-upload excel file is 
available on SharePoint site at My Navy Portal 
site https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-covid-19-reporting, with an 
effective implementation date of 03 September 2021.  After the implementation 
date, old excel files for mass-uploads will no longer be accepted. 
 
3.A.  VACCINATION STATUS.  Vaccination status is a required entry for all 
active and reserve service members.  Report vaccination status for civilians, 
contractors or dependents if known.  If unknown, report as unknown.
