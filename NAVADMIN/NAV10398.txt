RMKS/1.  REF A ELIMINATED THE ENLISTED FIELD SERVICE RECORD (EFSR) FOR ACTIVE 
DUTY, FULL TIME SUPPORT AND DRILLING RESERVE SAILORS IN SUPPORT OF THE 
MANDATORY USE OF NSIPS ESR AS THE FIELD'S SINGLE DATA ENTRY POINT FOR 
PERSONNEL RECORD MAINTENANCE PER REF B.  ALTHOUGH ESR AND OTHER OFFICIAL DATA 
TOOLS, SUCH AS THE ENLISTED DATA VERIFICATION REPORT (EDVR), PROVIDE THE 
COMMAND WITH MUCH OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS CONTAINED IN THE EFSR, COMMANDS 
MAY OCCASIONALLY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHICH MAY ONLY BE CONTAINED IN 
THE OFFICIAL MILITARY PERSONNEL FILE (OMPF).  THEREFORE, AN EFFICIENT AND 
CONTROLLED MEANS FOR COMMANDS TO VIEW THEIR SAILORS' OMPF HAS BEEN DEVELOPED.  
THIS NAVADMIN OUTLINES ACTIONS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN AND USE THE OMPF -COMMAND 
VIEW APPLICATION (OMPF VIEWER), OMPF-ADMIN ACCESS APPLICATION (MANAGE OMPF 
ACCESS ROLES), AND THE WAY AHEAD FOR OMPF RECORDS MANAGEMENT.

2.  OMPF ACCESS.  THE OMPF-COMMAND VIEW APPLICATION WILL PROVIDE ACCESS TO 
DESIGNATED USERS AS DEFINED IN PARAGRAPH 4 TO VIEW THIRD-PARTY RECORDS WITH 
JURISDICTION LIMITED WITHIN A UNIT IDENTIFICATION CODE
(UIC) DOMAIN.  THIRD-PARTY CONSTITUTES ANY INDIVIDUAL OTHER THAN THE SERVICE 
MEMBER WHOSE RECORD IS BEING REQUESTED OR VIEWED.  SYSTEMATIC ACCESS CONTROL 
LISTS (ACLS), AS WELL AS DESIGNATED ROLES WITHIN BOTH THE COMMAND VIEW AND 
ADMIN ACCESS APPLICATIONS, WILL CONTROL AUTHORITY TO GRANT ACCESS TO THE 
APPLICATION AS WELL AS VIEWING OMPF.  THE USER'S ACCESS WILL BE AUTHENTICATED 
BY USE OF COMMON ACCESS CARD (CAC) DOD PKI CERTIFICATES AND BOTH APPLICATIONS 
WILL BE ACCESSED THROUGH BOL.

3.  ACCESS CONTROL LISTS.  FLEET AND SHORE ADMINISTRATIVE ISIC/SUBORDINATE 
HIERARCHY ACCESS CONTROL LISTS (ACLS) WERE ESTABLISHED USING THE NAVY FORCE 
STRUCTURE AS DETERMINED IN REF C.  ACLS FOR RESERVE UNITS AND THEIR ADMIN 
SUPPORT ACTIVITIES WERE ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE USE OF ADMIN UNIT 
IDENTIFICATION CODES (ADMIN UIC) AND RESERVE UICS (RUIC), AS DETAILED IN REF 
D.  THE ACLS FOR PERSONNEL SUPPORT DETACHMENTS (PSD)/CUSTOMER SERVICE DESKS 
(CSD) AND THEIR CUSTOMER COMMANDS WERE ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE USE OF PAY 
PERSONNEL UICS (PPUICS).

4.  APPLICATION ACCESS ROLES.  THE TYPES OF ACCESS TO THE OMPF -COMMAND VIEW 
APPLICATION ARE ADMINISTRATOR (ADMIN) ACCESS USER, DELEGATED ADMIN ACCESS 
USER, COMMAND VIEW USER, AND COMMAND ONLY VIEW USER.
    A.  ADMIN ACCESS USERS ARE BASED ON BILLET SEQUENCE CODES CONTAINING 
SPECIFIED NAVY OFFICER BILLET CODES AND DISTRIBUTION ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION 
CODES (EX. FLAG OFFICER, CO, OIC, XO, CSO/COS AND
CMDCMS) THAT WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO THE APPLICATION.  THESE POSITIONS 
HAVE THE ABILITY TO MANAGE USER ACCESS FOR ONBOARD AND SUBORDINATE UICS WITHIN 
THE ACL, AS WELL AS HAVE ACCESS TO THE OMPFS.
    B.  DELEGATED ADMIN ACCESS USERS WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO
    MANAGE
USERS' VIEW ACCESS FOR ONBOARD AND SUBORDINATE UICS WITHIN THE ACL AND THE 
ABILITY TO VIEW THE OMPF.  COMMANDS ARE RESTRICTED TO ONE DELEGATED ADMIN 
ACCESS USER PER 200 BILLETS AUTHORIZED (BA).
    C. COMMAND VIEW USERS WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO VIEW OMPF FOR
    ONBOARD AND
SUBORDINATE UICS.
    D.  COMMAND ONLY VIEW USERS WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO VIEW
    OMPFS FOR THEIR
ONBOARD UIC(S).  THE TOTAL NUMBER OF USERS WITHIN A UIC WILL BE LIMITED TO TEN 
PERCENT OF BILLETS AUTHORIZED.

5.  PSDS/CSDS.  FOR PSDS AND CSDS, THE TYPES OF ACCESS OR USER ROLES ARE 
DELEGATED ADMIN ACCESS USER, COMMAND VIEW USER, AND COMMAND ONLY VIEW USER.
DUE TO THE LACK OF DEFAULT COMMAND IDENTIFIERS, SUCH AS NOBCS AND DNECS EACH 
PSD AND CSD MUST SUBMIT REQUESTS TO PERS-313, AS OUTLINED IN THE OMPF COMMAND 
VIEW USERS GUIDE, FOR DELEGATED ADMIN ACCESS USER RIGHTS.  EACH PSD AND CSD IS 
LIMITED TO THREE DELEGATED ADMIN ACCESS USERS AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF USERS 
WITHIN A PSD OR CSD IS 20. DELEGATED ADMIN ACCESS USERS WILL HAVE THE ABILITY 
TO MANAGE USERS' ACCESS WITHIN THE PSD OR CSD.

6.  PROGRAM MANAGERS REQUIRING GLOBAL ACCESS OR OTHER LIMITED ACCESS DUE TO 
UNDEFINED UIC HIERARCHY WILL SUBMIT THE REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO PERS -313, AS 
OUTLINED IN THE OMPF COMMAND VIEW USERS GUIDE, WITH JUSTIFICATION AND 
APPROPRIATE TERMINATION DATE OF THE REQUESTED ACCESS.

7.  INITIAL ACCESS.  OMPF INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED SENSITIVE - FOR OFFICIAL 
USE ONLY.  PRIOR TO ACCESSING THE OMPF-COMMAND VIEW APPLICATION THROUGH THE 
BUPERS ONLINE (BOL) PORTAL, USERS MUST REVIEW THE OMPF-COMMAND VIEW USER'S 
MANUAL AND HAVE A REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO ELECTRONIC MILITARY PERSONNEL RECORDS 
SYSTEM (EMPRS), NAVPERS 1070/857, ON FILE WITH THE FINAL APPROVAL AUTHORITY.  
THE OMPF-COMMAND VIEW USER'S MANUAL DETAILS THE COMPLETION STEPS AND APPROVAL 
AUTHORITIES FOR THE EMPRS REQUEST FORM.  THE MANUAL ALSO DETAILS THE LIST OF 
DESIGNATED BILLET NOBCS/DNECS FOR ADMIN ACCESS ROLES, LISTS THE SECTIONS OF 
THE OMPFS WHICH ARE VIEWABLE, THE STEPS REQUIRED TO ASSIGN AND UNASSIGN USERS, 
VIEW, PRINT, AND DOWNLOAD OMPF DOCUMENTS, AS WELL AS GUIDANCE FOR REPORTING 
AND UPDATING PPUICS.  THE MANUAL IS LOCATED AT 
HTTP://WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/CAREERINFO/RECORDSMANAGEMENT
/OMPF_CMDVIEW.HTM.

8.  OMPF-MY RECORD.  THE FUTURE OF OMPF RECORDS MANAGEMENT INVOLVES 
SIMPLIFYING THE CURRENT VIEW CAPABILITY OF OMPF RECORDS AND DETERMINING A 
LONG-TERM TECHNICAL SOLUTION TO VIEW OMPF RECORDS.  TO SIMPLIFY THE CURRENT 
OMPF VIEW CAPABILITY, THE NAME OF WEB-ENABLED RECORD REVIEW (WERR) HAS CHANGED 
TO OMPF-MY RECORD.  AS OUTLINED IN REF C WERR ALLOWS A SAILOR TO VIEW THEIR 
INDIVIDUAL OMPF AND ITS NAME HAS BEEN CHANGED TO CLARIFY ITS PURPOSE.  OMPF-MY 
RECORD ALLOWS EACH SAILOR TO VIEW THEIR SPECIFIC OMPF, AND OMPF-COMMAND VIEW 
WILL ALLOW AUTHORIZED USERS TO VIEW OMPF RECORDS FOR SAILORS UNDER THEIR 
COMMAND HIERARCHY. FOCUS GROUPS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN FY
2011 AT VARIOUS
FLEET CONCENTRATION AREAS TO DETERMINE A LONG-TERM PLAN FOR OMPF VIEW 
CAPABILITY.
STAKEHOLDERS WILL BE ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FOCUS GROUPS AND TO PROVIDE 
RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENHANCE OR MODIFY THE USABILITY AND FUNCTIONALITY THE OMPF-
COMMAND VIEW APPLICATION.

9.  QUESTIONS CONCERNING OMPF-COMMAND VIEW MAY BE DIRECTED TO THE NPC CUSTOMER 
SERVICE CENTER AT 1-866-U-ASK-NPC, DSN 882-5672 OR CSCMAILBOX(AT)NAVY.MIL.
