SUBJ/TASK FORCE LIFE/WORK (TFLW) UPDATE// 
RMKS/1. LAST MONTH WE ANNOUNCED THE STAND UP OF TASK FORCE LIFE/WORK
(TFLW) WITH THE MISSION OF DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES, 
PROGRAMS, AND CHANGES WITH REAL POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE OUR SAILORS 
LIFE/WORK BALANCE.  THESE PROGRAMS ARE BEING CREATED TO BENEFIT SAILORS 
AND FLEET INPUT IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL DURING THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE.  WE 
WELCOME AND VALUE THE THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, AND INSIGHTS OF THOSE WHO ARE, 
AND WILL BE, THE LEADERS OF THE 21ST CENTURY NAVY.  WE NEED YOU TO TELL 
US WHAT LIFE/WORK BALANCE MEANS TO YOU AND WHAT INITIATIVES WOULD 
IMPACT YOU MOST POSITIVELY.  TO MEET THAT GOAL, TFLW DEVELOPED THREE 
METHODS BY WHICH TO SUBMIT YOUR FEEDBACK:  THE TFLW WEBSITE, THE TFLW 
ONLINE BLOG, AND THE TFLW ROADSHOW.

UNDER THE HEADING <SUPPORT SERVICES> OR VIA THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS:

ANNOUNCEMENTS AND BRIEFS, ROADSHOW SCHEDULE, AND AN EMAIL LINK TO 
SUBMIT DIRECT FEEDBACK TO TASK FORCE REPRESENTATIVES.
3.  AT THE NPC WEBSITE, YOU CAN ALSO ACCESS THE TFLW ONLINE COMMUNITY 
BLOG AND APPLY FOR MEMBERSHIP TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ONGOING DISCUSSION. 
CREATE A NEW BLOG ACCOUNT BY USING YOUR .MIL EMAIL ACCOUNT.
