RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces Detailing Marketplace Assignment Policy 
(DMAP) Phase III.  Beginning in the June 2023 MyNavy Assignment (MNA) cycle, 
Active Component Sailors in the following six sea intensive ratings will be 
incorporated into DMAP in line with references (a) through (c):
          ABE(A101)         QM(B450)
          EM (B210)         AO(A420)
          AME(A131)         GM(B320)
DMAP Phase I and Phase II ratings (ABH, ABF, GSM, CS, MM, DC, IC, and RS) 
continue in DMAP.

2.  Sailors on sea duty in these six DMAP Phase III ratings with projected 
rotation dates (PRD) on or before 1 June 2024 may opt out of DMAP for their 
upcoming assignment process and enter the legacy sea shore flow marketplace 
in line with references (d) and (e) by submitting an Electronic Personnel 
Action Request (NAVPERS 1306/7) to their detailer, via their command, no 
later than 31 May 2023.  All other Sailors in the six DMAP Phase III ratings 
will be automatically enrolled in DMAP and have their PRDs updated 
accordingly.

3.  References (a), (b), and (c) remain in effect and are now applicable to 
DMAP Phase III ratings.  Anywhere guidance is specified for DMAP Phase I 
and/or II ratings will now be read as applying to DMAP Phase I, II, and III
