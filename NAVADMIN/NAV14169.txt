SUBJ/COAST GUARD BIRTHDAY MESSAGE//

RMKS/1.  Congratulations to the men and women of the Coast Guard and your 
families as you celebrate the 224th birthday of the United States Coast Guard 
on 4 August 2014.

2.  From conducting at-sea rescues in stormy weather, combating seaborne 
threats, or guaranteeing the safety and health of our waterways, the Coast 
Guard is there, always ready.

3.  Our services share a common maritime tradition, and our continued 
collaboration in support of our shared maritime service will, no doubt, 
strengthen our service to our Nation.  I look forward to increased 
cooperation between the Navy and Coast Guard in the future.

4.  The men and women of the U.S. Navy along with the citizens of America are 
thankful for the Coast Guard that is *Semper Paratus* to protect us from 
danger or defend our shores from seaborne threats. Happy Birthday, Shipmates.

5.  Released by the Chief of Naval Operations.//
