RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE ONE TO REF A AND ANNOUNCES 
CHANGES TO NUCLEAR OFFICER INCENTIVE PAY (NOIP) CONTINUATION PAY (COPAY) RATES.

2.  NAVY LEADERSHIP REMAINS COMMITTED TO RETAINING THE RIGHT QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF 
NUCLEAR-TRAINED OFFICERS.  THE NAVY IDENTIFIED A CRITICAL SHORTFALL OF COMMAND SERVED 
SUBMARINE OFFICERS BEYOND 24 YEARS OF COMMISSIONED SERVICE (YCS).  AS SUCH, THE NUCLEAR 
OFFICER COPAY RATE FOR OFFICERS WITH AT LEAST 24 YCS IS BEING RAISED IN FISCAL YEAR 2013 TO 
IMPROVE RETENTION OF THESE HIGHLY SKILLED OFFICERS.

3.  EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, THE COPAY RATE WILL INCREASE FROM $30,000 TO $35,000 FOR 3-YR, 4-
YR, 5-YR, AND 6-YR CONTRACTS FOR SUBMARINE COMMAND SERVED OFFICERS WITH AT LEAST 24 YCS.  
THE INITIAL 3-YR COPAY CONTRACT RATE REMAINS UNCHANGED AT $17,500.  THE COPAY CONTRACT 
RATE FOR ALL OTHER CONTRACTS REMAINS UNCHANGED AT $30,000.

4.  PER REF A, OFFICERS CURRENTLY UNDER A COPAY CONTRACT MAY EXECUTE A REPLACEMENT 
CONTRACT IF THEY MEET ALL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.  AN OFFICER WITH AN EXISTING CONTRACT MAY 
REQUEST A NEW CONTRACT PROVIDED THE TOTAL AMOUNT TO BE PAID UNDER THE NEW CONTRACT IS 
GREATER THAN THE TOTAL AMOUNT AGREED TO IN THE EXISTING CONTRACT.
THE NEW CONTRACT MUST BE EQUAL TO OR EXCEED THE REMAINING PERIOD OF THE EXISTING 
CONTRACT SO LONG AS THE PERIOD OF OBLIGATED SERVICE DOES NOT EXTEND BEYOND 30 YCS.  
OFFICERS WHO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS AND DESIRE A NEW CONTRACT MAY SUBMIT THEIR REQUEST 
PER ENCL (3) OF REF A.

5.  ANNUAL INCENTIVE BONUS REMAINS UNCHANGED AT $12,500 FOR UNRESTRICTED LINE OFFICERS, 
$10,000 FOR LIMITED DUTY OFFICERS AND $22,000 FOR CAPTAINS WITH GREATER THAN 26 YCS OR 
SCREENED MAJOR COMMAND/MAJOR PROGRAM MANAGER.  THE NUCLEAR OFFICER ACCESSION 
BONUS ALSO REMAINS UNCHANGED.

6.  QUESTIONS REGARDING NOIP SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO NPC PERS-421D, AT
(901) 874-3933/DSN 882.
