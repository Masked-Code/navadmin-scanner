NARR/REF A IS THE NAVADMIN 160/22, SKILLBRIDGE EMPLOYMENT SKILLS TRAINING 
GUIDANCE.   
REF B IS THE DOD FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT REGULATION.// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN message updates SkillBridge registration procedures to 
be conducted within the new SkillBridge application portal.  It additionally 
institutes new policy controls.  Reference (a) remains in full effect except 
as modified below. 
 
2.  Policy and procedure changes in this NAVADMIN are effective immediately 
for all new SkillBridge applicants.  In line with reference (a), Sailors with 
prior command approval are grandfathered and may start or continue their 
SkillBridge program as approved by their command.  Sailors without command 
approval must reapply under the guidelines of this message. 
 
3.  From this point forward, Sailors desiring to participate in SkillBridge 
must register and apply for SkillBridge approval using the application portal 
via MyNavy Education at https://myeducation.netc.navy.mil/.  E-mail 
registrations are no longer being accepted.  Application portal instructions 
can be found at  
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Transition/SkillBridge/.  
 
4.  SkillBridge is intended to provide transition assistance and skill 
development for Service members leaving the Navy.  However, it is not an 
entitlement and participation does impact readiness.  As such, the time 
allowed for program participation is now based on paygrade.  If approved, 
SkillBridge must occur prior to any terminal leave or permissive temporary 
duty associated with separation, fleet reserve, or retirement.  The following 
limits indicate the maximum amount of time prior to the actual separation, 
fleet reserve, or retirement date that SkillBridge participation can 
commence. 
    a.  Tier one (enlisted E5 and below) - 180 days or less. 
    b.  Tier two (enlisted E6-E9) - 120 days or less. 
    c.  Tier three (officers O4 and below) - 120 days or less. 
    d.  Tier four (officers O5 and above) - 90 days or less. 
 
5.  SkillBridge applications for tier four personnel shall not be approved if 
participation would result in a gapped billet. Additionally, tier four 
applicants now require positive endorsement from the Director, Military 
Personnel Plans and Policy (OPNAV N13) before they can begin 
SkillBridge.  Commanding officers (CO) must certify in any approval for tier 
four applicants that SkillBridge participation will not result in a gap.  The 
Office of the Chief of Naval Personnel (OPNAV) SkillBridge registrar will 
forward command-approved requests for tier four personnel to OPNAV N13.  The 
registrar will then notify applicants of OPNAV N13's decision. 
 
6.  Personnel who have received service-funded education, to include tuition 
assistance, under-graduate and post-graduate education, will not be permitted 
to start SkillBridge until all obligated service for that education is 
complete. 
 
7.  Officers must fulfill their minimum service requirement for commissioning 
prior to starting SkillBridge. 
 
8.  Officers serving under a retention bonus will not be permitted to start 
SkillBridge until the service obligation for that bonus is complete. 
 
9.  COs should consider whether allowing SkillBridge participation by Sailors 
in receipt of skill or billet-based special and incentive pays would 
negatively impact mission readiness.  In line with reference (a), COs are 
always fully authorized to deny or curtail SkillBridge requests in light of 
mission readiness impacts. 
 
10.  Sailors who relinquish an overseas housing allowance or overseas 
military housing to return to the continental United States for SkillBridge 
participation are not currently eligible for a housing allowance in line with 
reference (b).  This is a recognized gap that OPNAV is actively working with 
the Department of Defense in order to develop a solution. 
 
11.  All other policies in reference (a) remain in effect. 
 
12.  Additional resources are available at 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Transition/SkillBridge/. 
 
13.  Direct all questions regarding SkillBridge policy to 
navy_skillbridge.fct(at)navy.mil or by phone at (703) 604-5310. 
 
14.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
