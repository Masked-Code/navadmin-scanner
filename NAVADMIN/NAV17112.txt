RMKS/1.  Before announcing our Navy nominees selected to compete for the 2017 
Secretary of Defense Maintenance Awards, I want to personally thank the 
numerous commands who took time to recognize the tremendous contributions 
from your field-level maintenance units and depot-level maintenance programs.  
Your continued participation in this competition ensures that our outstanding 
maintenance teams are recognized for their remarkable efforts and support 
they provide to our warfighters.  It was an honor to review such a large and 
competitive field of deserving units.  This years submissions were all 
exceptional, making it particularly difficult to select our nominees to 
compete as finalists against the rest of the Department of Defense 
maintenance community.

2.  Annually, the Secretary of Defense will select six winners from across 
the Department of Defense to be awarded the SECDEF Field-Level Maintenance 
Award, two from each competitive category (small, medium, and large).  From 
these six winning units, one will be selected as the best of the best and 
named the annual SECDEF Phoenix Award winner.  Our Navy nominees selected for 
the field-level competition categories are:
    a.  Small Commands:
        Patrol Squadron FIVE (VP-5), Jacksonville, FL
        Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Detachment (AIMD) Atsugi, Japan
    b.  Medium Commands:
        Fleet Readiness Center Mid-Atlantic (FRCMA) Oceana, Norfolk, VA
        Assault Craft Unit FOUR (ACU-4), Virginia Beach, VA
    c.  Large Commands:
        USS HARRY S TRUMAN (CVN 75), Norfolk, VA
        Southwest Regional Maintenance Center, San Diego, CA

3.  Annually, the Secretary of Defense will also select one program from an 
organic depot-level maintenance activity to be awarded the Robert T. Mason 
Award for Depot Maintenance Excellence.  Our Navy nominees selected for the 
depot-level competition are:
    a.  Fleet Readiness Center Southwest (FRCSW) F/A-18 IPT, San Diego, CA
    b.  Fleet Readiness Center Southeast (FRCSE) Manufacturing IPT,
        Jacksonville, FL

4.  A Secretary of Defense Selection Board comprised of senior maintenance 
leaders from each service will evaluate nominated submissions from the 
Services and select six field-level winners (two per category), and one 
depot-level winner.  All SECDEF Maintenance Award winners will be recognized 
by the Office of the Secretary of Defense at a formal awards ceremony 
scheduled to be held on 5 December 2017 in Salt Lake City, UT.  Selected 
winners and details on the awards ceremony will be announced later this year 
in a separate NAVADMIN message.

5.  Thank you to all who submitted entries into this years SECDEF Maintenance 
Awards competition.  The outstanding initiative, imagination, and 
professionalism demonstrated from our entire maintenance community is a true 
reflection of our Navy-wide core attributes; Integrity, Accountability, 
Initiative, and Toughness.  Congratulations to our selected Navy nominees, I 
know that you will represent the Navy well in the SECDEF competition!
