RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE 39TH CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF JOINT 
PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION (PME) FOR SENIOR LEADERS.  THE NAVAL WAR 
COLLEGE (NWC) FLEET SEMINAR PROGRAM (FSP) OFFERS NAVY AND JOINT INTERMEDIATE 
LEVEL PME THROUGH A SET OF THREE COURSES:  STRATEGY AND WAR (S&W), THEATER 
SECURITY DECISION MAKING (TSDM), AND JOINT MARITIME OPERATIONS (JMO).  EACH 
COURSE NORMALLY REQUIRES ONE ACADEMIC YEAR TO COMPLETE.  ALL THREE COURSES 
ARE NOT OFFERED SIMULTANEOUSLY AT ALL LOCATIONS.  THERE IS NO TUITION FEE AND 
COURSE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED ON A LOAN BASIS AT NO COST TO THE STUDENTS.

2.  THE NWC FSP WILL BE OFFERED IN 19 REGIONAL LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES 
FOR ACADEMIC YEAR 2014-2015.  PLANNED LOCATIONS AND COURSES ARE:

COMMAND AND STAFF IN NEWPORT, RI.  SEMINARS FOR EACH COURSE MEET ONE EVENING 
PER WEEK FOR APPROXIMATELY 34 WEEKS, COMMENCING IN EARLY SEPTEMBER 2014 AND

VISITING NWC FACULTY, THESE COURSES REPLICATE BOTH THE CONTENT AND ATMOSPHERE 
OF THE RESIDENT COURSES OF STUDY.  SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF ALL THREE COURSES 
RESULTS IN THE AWARD OF A COLLEGE OF NAVAL COMMAND AND STAFF DIPLOMA, AS WELL 
AS CREDIT FOR INTERMEDIATE LEVEL JOINT PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION PHASE 
ONE (JPME-I).  THE FSP SEMINARS AT THE 19 LOCATIONS ARE CONDUCTED IN-STEP
