RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancel references (a) through (e), and provides 
updated guidance to DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) requirements.  Below 
is the mandatory timeline to complete the implementation of PKI for Nonsecure 
Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) and Secret Internet Protocol 
Router Network (SIPRNet).  This NAVADMIN applies to all Navy owned, operated, 
and controlled NIPRNet and SIPRNet networks, web servers, and applications.

2.  Definition.  Tactical networks and systems are defined in alignment with 
references (g) through (i).  A tactical network or system directly supports a 
combat element or forward deployed operation whether ashore, afloat, or 
aloft.  Non-tactical networks are business systems or systems that do not 
directly support maintenance and training efforts associated with tactical 
(warfighting) systems.  These systems are specifically excluded from tactical 
network and tactical system characterization.

3.  Background.  Per reference (f), DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) 
directed strict enforcement on the use of PKI to access all accounts on DoD 
Information Networks.  Navy will execute DOD CIOs objective of enhancing our 
cybersecurity posture with the following actions.

4.  Immediate action.  General end user and privileged accounts must meet the 
following requirements:
    a.  For NIPRNet, eliminate the use of all username/password accounts, 
non-tactical and tactical, by 29 February 2016.  Eliminate the use of 
username/password access to PKI enabled websites by 31 May 2016.
    b.  For SIPRNet, eliminate the use of all username/password accounts, 
non-tactical and tactical, by 31 July 2016.
    c.  Accounts not in compliance by applicable deadlines will be disabled.
    d.  SIPRNet National Security Systems (NSS) tokens will be issued to new 
personnel by all accession sources (e.g., Naval Academy, Reserve Officers 
Training Corp) before members are transferred to operating forces or initial 
training.  All Navy personnel will retain their SIPRNet NSS token when 
transitioning between commands and when transitioning to a different network 
enclave (e.g., Next Generation Network to OCONUS Navy Enterprise Navy 
Network).  SIPRNet NSS tokens must be suspended by the losing command and 
reactivated by the gaining command during transition.  Service members will 
retain their token until separated from the Navy.

5.  Exceptions.
    a.  All approved PKI exceptions (waivers) are rescinded, except for 
accounts on networks, systems, or applications that are technically unable to 
implement a solution to provide two-factor authentication.  New exception 
requests will only be considered for networks, systems, or applications 
technically unable to implement a PKI solution or two-factor authentication.
    b.  If PKI authentication or alternate two factor authentication method 
cannot be implemented within the required deadlines, system owners must 
submit a waiver request endorsed by the first Flag Officer in the chain of 
command.  Echelon II exception requests must be submitted to OPNAV N2N6BC 
using the PKI waiver template and process posted at:  
https://infosec.navy.mil/PKI/pkipolicy.jsp and include a fully resourced Plan 
of Action & Milestones to implement PKI.  Additionally, Echelon IIs will 
audit approved excepted accounts every 30 days and take action as required to 
mitigate risk to the Navy enterprise.
    c.  Exception requests do not have to be submitted for Windows service 
accounts (computer-to-computer accounts with passwords that provide services 
such as active directory connector or SQL server express).
    d.  Submarine Force commands that have not completed the Navy Certificate 
Validation Infrastructure server installation are exempt from given timeline 
for SIPRNet and will continue to use username/password for account access.

6.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.

Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
