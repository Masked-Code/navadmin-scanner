DEPLOYABLE SERVICE MEMBERS.  REF C IS THE COMMANDING OFFICERS TOOL KIT.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces reference (a), which establishes the Navy 
Deployability Assessment and Assignment Program.  To improve personnel 
readiness across the force, this program will ensure the timely disposition, 
processing and accountability for Active Component (AC), full-time support 
(FTS) and Selected Reserve
(SELRES) Service members who are either medically, legally or 
administratively limited from deployment.

2.  The Deputy Chief of Naval Personnel (DCNP) is the single process owner of 
the Navy Deployability Assessment and Assignment Program.
Assistant Commander, Navy Personnel Command for Career Management
(PERS-4) is the AC and FTS Program Manager.  Deputy Commander, Navy Reserve 
Force (DCNRF) is the SELRES Program Manager.

3.  Commands are charged to proactively manage overall personnel readiness to 
meet force lethality objectives.  Ultimately, it is the personal 
responsibility of every Sailor to maintain individual readiness, including 
medical, dental, physical and administrative (e.g., maintaining a family care 
plan) readiness.  Medical deployability will be considered during each 
healthcare encounter.

4.  A Sailor is deployable if he or she does not have a Service- determined 
reason that precludes him or her from deployment.
References (a) and (b) provide guidance for assessment of the deployability 
of Service members, classification of that deployability and execution of the 
policy objectives of the Department of Defense with regard to increasing 
force lethality.
Military treatment facilities (MTF) and commands will make deployability 
assessments by determining the ability of a Service member to perform 
appropriate military duties commensurate with his or her office, grade, rank 
and skill in light of ongoing medical treatment or administrative 
limitations.

5.  The deployability of Sailors will be tracked by the respective AC/FTS and 
SELRES Deployability Assessment and Assignment Program Managers.  Starting 1 
October 2018, in line with reference (b), Sailors who have been non-
deployable for 12 consecutive months will be notified of mandatory processing 
for administrative separation or referral to the Disability Evaluation System 
as appropriate.
Reference (a) provides guidance on submitting requests for retention.

6.  Commands will use written counseling and fitness reports/performance 
evaluations to document a Service members knowing failure to comply with 
responsibilities to maintain individual readiness (e.g., missing medical or 
dental appointments or intentional failure to disclose status affecting 
deployability).
Maintaining medical readiness through prescribed healthcare encounters (e.g., 
PHA, annual dental exam, medical screenings in conjunction with PARFQ, etc.) 
is a key component of identifying and correcting non-deployable conditions.  
When Service members fail to maintain individual readiness by design or 
neglect, it results in a less lethal and deployable force.  Accordingly, 
commands must be diligent in ensuring Service members meet obligations and 
document the failure of those who demonstrate an unwillingness to do so.
Failure of a Service member to comply with this policy could ultimately 
result in administrative separation.  MILPERSMAN 1610-015 and BUPERS 1610.10D 
update provide additional guidance.
