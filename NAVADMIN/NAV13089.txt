SUBJ/NATIONAL CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION MONTH//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE OBSERVANCE OF CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION 
MONTH, DESIGNATED BY CONGRESS IN 1983.  NAVY'S GOAL IS TO SUPPORT THE NATIONAL 
CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION INITIATIVE BY PROMOTING CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT 
AWARENESS ACTIVITIES THROUGH NAVY-WIDE EVENTS, RENEWING OUR COMMITMENT TO 
PROTECT OUR CHILDREN, REDUCING INCIDENCES OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT, AND 
SUPPORTING THE AFFECTED FAMILIES.  THE FY-12 DON HISTORICAL REVIEW OF DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE FATALITIES REVEALED THAT 71 PERCENT OF NAVY CHILD 
FATALITIES WERE RELATED TO CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT.

2.  NAVY COMMANDS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF CHILD ABUSE 
PREVENTION RESOURCES AND SERVICES WHILE REINFORCING SAFETY FOR OUR CHILDREN 
WHERE "ALL CHILDREN ARE SAFE."  THE CAMPAIGN THEME FOR THIS YEAR IS "BREAK THE 
CYCLE."  EVENTS MAY INCLUDE INTERACTIVE WORKSHOPS, SEMINARS, COMMUNITY 
AWARENESS EVENTS, PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS, SIGNING OF PROCLAMATIONS, 
LEADERSHIP VIDEO MESSAGES, AND TRAINING EVENTS.  DOWNLOADABLE CHILD ABUSE 
PREVENTION MONTH MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE AT HTTP://GO.USA.GOV/24RE (MUST USE 
LOWER CASE E IN INTERNET BROWSER).

3.  COMMANDERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO REFER SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS TO 
PARTICIPATE IN PARENT EDUCATION SERVICES TO LEARN SOUND PARENTING TECHNIQUES 
AT FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS (FFSC).
NAVY PARENTING EDUCATION FOCUSES ON SIX CRITICAL FACTORS:
A.  NURTURING AND ATTACHMENT;
B.  KNOWLEDGE OF PARENTING AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT; 
C.  PARENTAL RESILIENCE; 
D.  SOCIAL CONNECTIONS; 
E.  CONCRETE SUPPORTS IN TIME OF NEED; 
F.  SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL COMPETENCE FOR CHILDREN.
