REMARKS/1.  HAPPY HOLIDAYS SHIPMATES - DARLEEN AND I SEND YOU OUR WARMEST 
WISHES THIS HOLIDAY SEASON.  WE ARE CONTINUALLY IMPRESSED BY YOUR EXEMPLARY 
SACRIFICE AND SERVICE.

2.  IT HAS BEEN A REMARKABLE YEAR, A YEAR OF CHALLENGES AND A YEAR OF 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  WE REMAIN THE GREATEST NAVY IN THE WORLD BECAUSE OF EACH AND 
EVERY SAILOR, CIVILIAN, CONTRACTOR, AND FAMILY MEMBER ON OUR NAVY TEAM.  YOU 
HAVE DISPLAYED EXTRAORDINARY RESILIENCE AND ALWAYS COMPLETED THE MISSION.

3.  TO OUR HEROES DEPLOYED AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES, PLEASE REMEMBER THAT YOUR 
SACRIFICE IS AN INVALUABLE AND PRICELESS GIFT THAT OUR ENTIRE NATION GREATLY 
APPRECIATES.  BECAUSE YOU STAND THE WATCH, THE REST OF OUR NATION CAN ENJOY 
THIS TIME WITH FAMILIES AND FRIENDS.
 WE SALUTE YOUR COURAGE AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR SAFE RETURN HOME.

4.  FOR THOSE OF US AT HOME, WE SHOULD TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMEMBER OUR 
SHIPMATES ABROAD AS WELL AS OUR FALLEN HEROES WHO HAVE MADE THE ULTIMATE 
SACRIFICE.  PLEASE ALSO REMEMBER TO ENJOY THIS TIME WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND 
LOVED ONES.  WE COULDN'T DO WHAT WE DO WITHOUT THEIR SUPPORT.

5.  DARLEEN AND I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR FELLOW 
SHIPMATES, CELEBRATE RESPONSIBLY, AND TRAVEL SAFELY.  YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES 
ARE IN OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS THIS SEASON AND ALWAYS.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
SERVICE AND WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR.
