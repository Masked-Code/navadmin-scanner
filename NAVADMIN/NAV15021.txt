WOMEN.  REF B IS NAVADMIN 020/15, FY16 ENLISTED WOMEN IN SUBMARINES CHIEF 
PETTY OFFICER CONVERSION PROCESS.  REF C IS BUMED MANUAL FOR MEDICINE.

RMKS/1.  Per reference (a), the Navy*s plan to integrate enlisted women into 
the submarine force has been approved, and all submarine ratings and 
submarine Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) codes are open to enlisted 
women.

2.  The submarine force is seeking high caliber female applicants from all 
ratings.  Sailors from all communities are eligible to apply for submarine 
service as part of this initiative.  Per this NAVADMIN and reference (b), the 
Submarine Enlisted Community Manager (ECM) is accepting conversion 
applications for ranks E-1 through E-8.  The application process for E-7/8 is 
outlined in reference (b).

3.  Female recruits interested in submarine nuclear duty will be selected as 
part of the normal recruiting process.  Female Sailors in the nuclear 
training pipeline or serving as junior staff instructors
(JSIs) at a Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU) should contact their Command 
Career Counselors for details on how to volunteer for submarine service.

4.  In an effort to identify the most qualified Sailors and to ensure the 
success of this initiative, Sailors will be selected based on the following 
attributes:
    a.  COs endorsement describing the Sailor*s sustained superior 
performance.
    b.  Sea service experience.
    c.  Warfare qualification.
    d.  Job experience (i.e., assignments that can be related to
    success
in future submarine service)

5.  In addition to sustained superior performance and future potential of the 
Sailor, consideration will be given to current overall manning of the 
applicant*s rating, time served at the current command, and other factors 
that may affect the command or community*s manning.

6.  Application process for E-6 and below (non-nuclear trained personnel).
    a.  All conversion Sailors, regardless of rating or rank, must
    meet
the following minimum criteria to be eligible for conversion:
        (1) Must be medically screened and suitable for duty aboard a 
submarine per reference (c), MANMED Chapter 15 (to be completed within
30 days following selection).
        (2) Must be a US citizen already in possession of, or capable
        of
receiving, a secret security clearance.
        (3) Must meet ASVAB requirements for the desired rating(s) as

        (5) No marks less than *3.0* on the last five evaluations.
        (6) No PFA failures in the last three years.
    b.  Active duty and Full Time Support (FTS) reserve duty Sailors must

(see note 1), Electronics Technician -Navigation (ET-NAV), Electronics 
Technician-Communications (ET-COM), Logistics Specialist (LS), Culinary 
Specialist (CS), Yeoman (YN), and Machinist Mate-Auxiliary (MMA).  Each

following:
        (1) Last five performance evaluations.  (Sailors with minimal service 
may not have five evaluations * submit as many as the Sailor has on record.)
        (2) PRIMS data covering at least the last four years of PFA 
information, if available.
        (3) ASVAB scores.
        (4) NAVPERS 1306/7 signed by the Sailor and the Sailor*s CO 
identifying the Sailor*s top three submarine rating conversion choices and 
clearly stating the recommended *earliest and latest release* dates for the 
current command.
        (5) Official statement volunteering for submarine service as outlined 
in MILPERSMAN 1306-402.
    c.  Non-FTS reserve duty Sailors will submit packages per

ECM.  E-mail applications to joseph.m.hanley(at)navy.mil, 
aaron.norton(at)navy.mil, and james.drumgole(at)navy.mil.

    process
will begin on 16 April 2015.

8.  Application process for E-6 and below (nuclear-trained personnel).
The application process for E-6 and below nuclear-trained personnel will be 
coordinated by the individual Sailor*s Command Career Counselor at the NPTUs.  
Female JSIs or Sailors in initial training at NPTU interested in volunteering 
for submarine duty should inform their chain of command.  The chain of 
command at NPTU will develop an application package on each submarine 
volunteer that includes the following:
    a.  Last five performance evaluations.  (Sailors with minimal service may 
not have five evaluations * submit as many as the Sailor has on record.)

forward this information, along with the two ranked lists (JSI ranking and 
initial trainee ranking) of applicants, to the nuclear ECM at OPNAV N133.

9.  Once final selections are made for E-6 and below Sailors by the ECM, 
selectees will be notified via naval message.  Alternates will be utilized in 
the event that a selectee is found ineligible for conversion.

10.  This round of selections will apply to the women scheduled to integrate 
the first two submarine crews.  Subsequent NAVADMINs announcing follow-on 
submarine integrations will be periodically released to commence future 
application cycles.  Opportunities to reapply for assignment in submarines 
will be available at least annually.
