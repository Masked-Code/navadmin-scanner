RMKS/1.  September is National Insider Threat Awareness Month (NITAM).  This 
year the theme is Bystander Engagement, which means See Something, Say 
Something, Do Something.  The Navys priority is to take care of its people, 
which includes each of us knowing how to recognize insider threat indicators 
and taking action when we see them.  This requires All Hands on Deck! 
 
2.  The Navy Insider Threat Program developed a list of Insider Threat 
Potential Risk Indicators (PRI) to help identify concerning behaviors and 
appropriate actions to take.  A downloadable brochure can be found under the 
documents tab at https://flankspeed.sharepoint-
mil.us/sites/OPNAV/N2N6/NIA/InsiderThreat.  Concerning behaviors, such as 
described by these PRIs, should be reported to your chain of command and to 
the Navy Insider Threat Hub at (703) 695-7700, insiderthreat.fct(at)navy.mil, 
or https://www.secnav.navy.mil/itp/Pages/default.aspx.  The Navy Insider 
Threat Hub provides highly trained, multi-disciplinary, insider threat 
analysts to assess the potential risk an insider may pose and help Navy 
choose the best action.  When you report, you are providing the opportunity 
to prevent or mitigate risks and restore the Sailor, civilian, or contractor 
back to a trusted status. 
 
3.  This month, a variety of events are offered to raise awareness regarding 
insider threat.  Some are located in Washington, DC, while others are
