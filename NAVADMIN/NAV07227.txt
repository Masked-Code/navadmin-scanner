SUBJ/RETENTION - STAY NAVY CAMPAIGN// 
REF/A/DOC//OPNAV/03DEC06// APMN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1040.11B GOVERNING 
NAVY RETENTION AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS// 
RMKS/1.  THIS IS THE THIRD IN A RECURRING SERIES OF MESSAGES DESIGNED 
TO ENCOURAGE OUR SAILORS TO STAY NAVY.  THE FOCUS OF THIS MESSAGE IS 
THE IMPORTANCE OF WELL-EXECUTED CAREER DEVELOPMENT BOARDS.
2.  TO DESCRIBE THE CURRENT PERSONNEL BATTLESPACE, REENLISTMENT TRENDS 
PROJECT NAVY WILL COMPLETE FY07 BELOW NAVY REENLISTMENT RATE GOALS IN 
TWO OF THE THREE KEY ZONES.  IN ZONE A, SAILORS WITH UP TO SIX YEARS OF 
SERVICE, NAVY'S GOAL IS TO REENLIST 50 PERCENT OF THOSE SAILORS 
APPROACHING EAOS.  PROJECTIONS AT THE END OF JULY ESTIMATED THE YEAR-
END RESULTS AT APPROXIMATELY 46-47 PERCENT.  IN ZONE B, SAILORS WITH 
SIX TO TEN YEARS OF SERVICE, THE GOAL IS TO REENLIST 60 PERCENT.  HERE, 
PROJECTIONS AT THE END OF JULY ESTIMATED YEAR-END RESULTS AT 57-58 
PERCENT.  WHILE THESE RATES, WHEN COMBINED WITH INCREASED SHORT-TERM 
EXTENSION BEHAVIOR, WILL STILL KEEP US WITHIN
FY07 END STRENGTH REQUIREMENTS, WE MUST CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE OUR 
SAILORS TO MAKE A LONG TERM COMMITMENT BY REENLISTING AND STAYING NAVY.  
WE HOPE TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INCREASED SHORT-TERM 
EXTENSION TREND FROM THE RESULTS OF AN AUG 07 NAVY-WIDE QUICK POLL OF 
SAILORS WHO ARE CURRENTLY UNDER SHORT-TERM EXTENSIONS. 
ENCOURAGING LONG TERM RETENTION IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AS THE FORCE IS 
STABILIZED OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.  WE NEED THE BEST SAILORS WITH THE 
RIGHT SKILLS TO MAKE THE CHOICE TO STAY NAVY BASED ON VALID CAREER 
DEVELOPMENT INFORMATION. 
3.  SAILORS MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THE INFORMATION THEY HAVE.  IF THE 
PRIMARY SOURCE OF CAREER INFORMATION IS ?SCUTTLEBUTT? OR OTHER 
UNOFFICIAL CHANNELS, AND NOT TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FROM THEIR 
COMMAND LEADERSHIP, THEN SAILORS WILL MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON 
INCOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE.  WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE OUR MOST VALUABLE 
ASSETS, SAILORS IN WHOM WE HAVE INVESTED SO MUCH, BECAUSE OF INACCURATE 
CAREER INFORMATION.  I AM CONFIDENT OUR NAVY WILL BE A VERY COMPETITIVE 
CAREER OPTION IN THE MINDS OF OUR SAILORS WHEN THEY ARE WELL-INFORMED 
REGARDING THE MANY CAREER OPTIONS AND SERVICE BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO 
THEM.
4.  THE PROVEN DELIVERY METHOD OF CAREER INFORMATION TO OUR SAILORS IS 
VIA CAREER DEVELOPMENT BOARDS (CDB).  OFFICIAL GUIDANCE FOR CDB 
EXECUTION IS OUTLINED IN REF A.  WHEN CONDUCTED PROPERLY, CDB?S PROVIDE 
SAILORS THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO MAKE AN INFORMED CAREER DECISION.  
CDB?S ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMMAND MASTER CHIEF AND ARE 
COORDINATED BY THE COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR.  MEMBERSHIP SHOULD INCLUDE, 
BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, COMMAND MASTER CHIEF, COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR, 
EDUCATIONAL SERVICES OFFICER, DEPARTMENT AND DIVISION LEADING CHIEF, 
DEPARTMENT AND DIVISION CAREER COUNSELOR, DIVISION OFFICER, LEADING 
PETTY OFFICER, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE SAILOR.  AN EFFECTIVE CDB CAN 
NORMALLY BE COMPLETED WITHIN 20 TO 30 MINUTES AND SHOULD INCLUDE 
INFORMATION AND DISCUSSION ON WATCH QUALIFICATIONS, EDUCATION, 
ADVANCEMENT, PAY, FAMILY READINESS, RATING HEALTH, COMMAND EXPECTATIONS, 
AND SAILOR GOALS.  CDBS ARE REQUIRED UPON REPORTING (WITHIN 30 DAYS), 6 
MONTHS ON BOARD, 12 MONTHS ON BOARD, AND IN 12 MONTH INTERVALS 
THEREAFTER.  IDEALLY, CDBS ARE TRACKED AND NOTES ARE RECORDED IN THE 
CAREER INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (CIMS) DISCUSSED IN PARA 5 BELOW.  
THE GOAL OF SAILORS APPLYING FOR ORDERS BY THEMSELVES VIA CMS-ID CAN 
ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED IF EVERY SAILOR IS KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THEIR OWN 
CAREER PROGRESSION.  AN EFFECTIVE CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IS AN 
EXTREMELY VALUABLE INVESTMENT IN OUR SAILORS AND OFFERS THE BEST 
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO STAY NAVY.
5.  CAREER DEVELOPMENT TOOL:  CIMS IS A WEB-BASED SYSTEM BUILT BASED ON 
REQUIREMENTS GENERATED BY THE FLEET.  THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF CIMS IS 
TO ASSIST THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CAREER DEVELOPMENT OF 
SAILORS WITH TRACKING, CONDUCTING, AND DOCUMENTING CDB?S.  CIMS IS NOT 
ONLY WEB-BASED AND AVAILABLE TO EVERY NAVY COMMAND WHICH HAS ACCESS TO 
THE INTERNET BUT IT IS ALSO FUNCTIONING VIA THE NAVY STANDARD 
INTEGRATED PERSONNEL SYSTEM (NSIPS) DISCONNECTED OPERATIONS WEB-SERVER 
ON 147 SHIPS (AIRCRAFT CARRIERS TO FRIGATES).  BY VIRTUE OF CIMS 
RESIDING WITHIN NSIPS, CIMS DISPLAYS THE SERVICE MEMBER?S COMPLETE 
ELECTRONIC SERVICE RECORD, AS WELL AS INFORMATION SHARED FROM THE 
PHYSICAL READINESS INFORMATION SYSTEM (PRIMS), PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS), 
THE NAVY COLLEGE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (NCMIS), THE VIEWING OF 
PCS ORDERS, AND ALLOWS THE ASSIGNMENT OF SPONSORS.  FURTHER, CIMS CAN 
BE USED TO CREATE REPORTS ON A VARIETY OF TOPICS OF INTEREST TO COMMAND 
RETENTION TEAMS, BOTH ACTIVE AND RESERVE, INCLUDING STATUS OF PTS 
APPLICATIONS, UNIT TRACKING (EAOS/EOS, PRD, HYT, AGE 60) AND MORE. 
EVERY CCC SHOULD HAVE A CIMS ACCOUNT.  FOR ASSISTANCE IN ESTABLISHING A 
CIMS ACCOUNT, CONTACT NCCM KENNAMORE AT (901) 874- 2470/DSN 882 OR 
EMAIL AT JEFF.KENNAMORE(AT)NAVY.MIL OR NCCM MACK AT
(901) 874-3194/DSN 882 OR EMAIL JOSEPH.MACK(AT)NAVY.MIL AT THE CENTER 
FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT (CCD).
6.  BEST PRACTICES:  THE LEADERS AT NAVAL MOBILE CONSTRUCTION BATTALION 
FIVE (NMCB-5), HOMEPORTED IN PORT HUENEME, CALIFORNIA, HAVE ENSURED 
CDB?S ARE CONDUCTED EVEN WHEN THE COMMAND?S NCC BILLET IS UNFILLED.  
THE COMMAND FORMED A SELF DESCRIBED ?SUCCESS TEAM? AND BEGAN A CAMPAIGN 
CALLED ?60 DAYS TO SUCCESS,? RAISING AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF 
CDB?S AND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR SAILORS. 
CDB?S ARE COMPLETED DURING THIS CAMPAIGN.  THE COMMAND PROVIDES A 
PERSON TO ASSIST THE CAREER COUNSELOR FOR CIMS INPUT TO BE MORE 
EFFICIENT.  THE TEAM CONSISTS OF CAREER COUNSELORS, CPO?S, AND A SENIOR 
FIRST CLASS PETTY OFFICER TO ASSIST THE SAILOR, AND CONDUCTS CDB?S ON 
ALL ENLISTED SEABEES AT THE COMPANY LEVEL BEFORE DEPLOYMENT REGARDLESS 
OF THE NORMAL CDB REQUIREMENT.  NMCB-5?S PROGRAM HAS BEEN ONLINE AND 
RUNNING EFFICIENTLY AND THEY CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS TO IMPROVE THE 
DELIVERY AND QUALITY OF THE CDB?S TO THE INDIVIDUAL SEABEES.  MANY 
COMMANDS HAVE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES.  THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE 
PROCESS IS ENSURING THE BOARDS ARE HELD AND EACH SAILOR IS GIVEN THE 
INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION NECESSARY TO ENSURE THEY MAKE INFORMED CAREER 
DECISIONS.
