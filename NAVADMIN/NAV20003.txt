RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN highlights Navy Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 retention 
behavior, outlines the FY-20 retention environment, provides FY-20 
reenlistment benchmarks and updates the FY-20 Retention Excellence Award 
(REA) criteria.  Additionally it reemphasizes our commitment towards 
promoting a culture of excellence in line with reference (a), and the need to 
retain the best and brightest talent on our Navy team.

2.  FY-19 Retention Behavior.  Our FY-19 retention and attrition results were 
outstanding and reflected your considerable efforts in recruiting and 
retaining our talented pool of Sailors.  We experienced an appreciable 
decrease in attrition and exceeded our FY-19 retention benchmarks in all 
zones attaining 64% for Zone A (55% benchmark), 72% for Zone B (65% 
benchmark) and 85% for Zone C (80% benchmark).  Despite a strong U.S. 
economy, we have maintained excellent retention since FY-18, largely 
accomplished through our Sailor 2025 initiatives which are intended to 
provide Sailors with the choices, flexibility and transparency they have come 
to expect and could already receive from the private sector.  Our Sailors are 
proudly declaring that the Navy remains their employer of choice.
We endeavored to provide the right mix of monetary and non-monetary 
incentives to retain all eligible Sailors and their families.  In FY-20, we 
are positioned for even greater retention across all zones with continuation 
of the Meritorious Advancement Program and other initiatives such as the 
Advance to Position program and the Pay for Performance pilot.

3.  FY-20 Retention Environment.  Recognizing that we are in a Great Power 
Competition, challenges at-sea and across the globe require that we retain 
the experience and proficiency required to ensure we are operationally ready.  
Every Sailor is critical in that endeavor, whether inport, during training 
exercises, or sailing into harms way.  Your leadership and engagement at 
every level is needed to maintain our retention momentum and ensure we are 
properly manned for every mission.

4.  FY-20 Reenlistment Benchmarks.  To retain the right talent, in the right 
mix of skills and communities, we must surpass the retention benchmarks set 
in previous years.  To this end, the All- Navy FY-20 reenlistment benchmarks 
have increased for Echelon II and III commands to use as part of their REA:

Zone A (0 TO 6 Years of Service)       57 percent
Zone B (6 TO 10 Years of Service)      67 percent
Zone C (10 TO 14 Years of Service)     82 percent
Zone A Attrition                       4.5 percent or less

Reserve affiliations will continue to be a part of the computation.
We are a total force, both active and reserve meeting the mission together.
    a.  As detailed in reference (d), Echelon II commands will align their 
recognition programs to support the achievement of the FY-20 All-Navy 
reenlistment benchmarks.
    b.  Echelon II commands, type commanders (TYCOM) and immediate superiors 
in command (ISIC) will determine the necessity of waivers where command-level 
performance and personnel complement dictate.

5.  Retention Excellence Award.  The annual REA is built upon the tenets in 
references (b) and (c), Brilliant on the Basics.  Commands will be REA 
eligible if they meet the FY-20 retention and attrition benchmarks cited in 
paragraph 4.  Benchmarks must be met for at least two quarters of the fiscal 
year.
    a.  Computation Exceptions.  A zone with zero transactions at or before 
end of active obligated service will qualify as a 100 percent reenlistment 
rate if the command has qualifying transactions in the other zones.  Only two 
zones may be allowed to default to 100 percent.
    b.  Loss transactions on a Sailor transferred from a command due to 
pending separation, medical hold or a legal hold will reflect on the command 
the Sailor was last attached to in an accounting code 100 status.
    c.  Commands must have, at a minimum, one zone of qualifying transactions 
to be eligible for the REA.  Waivers may be considered on a case-by-case 
basis for small commands that have outstanding programs but no junior 
Sailors.
    d.  Requests for waivers of any award element in paragraph 4 must be 
submitted in writing via the respective ISIC/TYCOM with specific 
justification.  Waiver requests must be signed by the commanding officer.  
Requests not positively endorsed at any level will not be considered.  Waiver 
approval authority resides with Echelon II commands.
    e.  TYCOM and direct reporting counselors will evaluate and submit 
eligible commands to their respective Echelon II commands no later than 1 
December 2020.

6.  REA Announcement and Recognition.  Echelon II commands should announce 
their FY-20 REA recipients following the consolidation of Echelon III and 
direct reporting command submissions no later than 31 December 2020.  
Following the announcement message, awardees may fly the retention excellence 
pennant or paint their anchor gold until the release of the following FY 
award message.

7.  Command Information Program Review (CIPR).  CIPR is the primary resource 
to assess the effectiveness of the command career development program (CDP) 
which focuses on Sailor retention.  To incentivize healthy retention behavior 
and give time back to focus on training and warfighting readiness, commands 
who earn the REA and achieve reenlistment benchmarks are exempt from a TYCOM 
and ISIC review not to exceed 2 consecutive years.  To ensure no degradation 
of the CDP, TYCOM and ISICs are strongly encouraged to conduct spot checks on 
subordinate commands to include those exempted.  Echelon II commands with 
TYCOM input will determine the percentage of CDP spot checks.  A key 
component in running an effective program is the ability to access and 
transmit information.  In line with references (d) and (e), it is vital that 
command career counselors have the highest level of internet access to 
accomplish mission requirements.
