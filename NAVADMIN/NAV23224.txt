RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the next application window for positions on 
the Navy Electronic sports (Esports) Team by Commander, Navy Recruiting 
Command (CNRC).  The Navy Esports Team significantly contributes to the 
multi-faceted outreach campaign of CNRC by engaging with prospective Sailors 
online and at gaming venues.  Centennials are moving into digital spaces for 
most of their content consumption and social interactions, and the Esports 
domain is one of the most popular and vibrant online arenas to date. 
Connecting with future Sailors requires the Navy to be in the same spaces 
where those future Sailors reside. 
 
2.  Open to all Sailors E-5 and above, the qualifications to become a team 
member are identical to the qualifications needed for recruiting duty.  Refer 
to reference (a) for further details.

Upon selection, they will receive a set of three year orders to CNRC in 
Millington, Tennessee.  All team members receive recruiting training at Navy 
Recruiter Orientation Unit (NORU), Pensacola, Florida, en route to CNRC.  The 
intent of NORU training will be to further develop communication skills and 
to ensure that team members understand the types of information sought by 
those inquiring about service in the Navy. 
 
4.  The team members will operate at the Navy Esports facility which is 
specifically designed for the team to practice, stream, and compete.  Upon 
arrival at CNRC, they will develop a routine streaming cadence, encouraging 
followers and viewers to interact with the members and outreach content, and 
compete against high schools, colleges, and Esports league events across the 
country.
