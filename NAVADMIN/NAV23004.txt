RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and announces the authorization 
of the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Navy Sea, Air, and Land (SEAL)/Special 
Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen (SWCC) Senior Enlisted Retention Bonus 
(SSRB).  The NSW SSRB is part of the overarching effort of the Navy to size, 
shape, and stabilize the force. 
 
2.  Program Overview.  This bonus is authorized under references (b) and 
(c).  The Naval Special Warfare Enlisted Community Manager (BUPERS-324) will 
act as the NSW SSRB program manager.  All applications for this bonus will be 
submitted to the program manager for processing and tracking.  By law, 
Sailors may receive no more than 360,000 dollars in retention bonus monies 
over a career. 
Selective reenlistment bonus (SRB) awards are included in that cap. 
The eligibility criteria stated in this NAVADMIN can be reduced at any time 
by the program manager based on the needs of the NSW community, with the 
approval of the Director, Military Personnel Plans and Policy (OPNAV N13). 
 
3.  Eligibility.  NSW senior enlisted Sailors with the O26X or O52X 
Navy enlisted classification (NEC), in paygrades E-7 and above, who have 
between 20 and 28 years of active service (YOAS), will be eligible to apply 
for the NSW SSRB, but must also meet the following eligibility criteria: 
    a.  Be serving on active duty in the Active Component. 
    b.  Have the favorable recommendation of the commanding officer (CO) for 
receipt of NSW SSRB.

contract are not eligible to receive a SSRB for service outlined in the

    c.  Sailors with documented misconduct or below standard performance may

5.  Contract Terms.  NSW SSRB contract lengths, payments, and Active 
Component service obligations are outlined below.

serves a partial year, that year will be prorated pursuant to the bonus

        (4) SSRB Contract.  SSRB contract phases may be combined as long as 
the Sailor is eligible to receive payments to the contracted end dates. 
    b.  NSW SSRB contracts will be for a minimum of 2 and a maximum of  
3 years.  Sailors under the SSRB contract will not submit a request for 
retirement with an effective date that is prior to the completion of the 
agreement.  Sailors must reenlist or extend their enlistment contract, soft 
end of active obligated service, for a period of at least 2 years.  Sailors 
are authorized early reenlistment in order to align SSRB and reenlistment 
contracts. 
Reenlistments and extensions may be combined to align service dates for the 
maximum opportunity, up to a reenlistment of 6 years and an extension of up 
to 12 months. 
 
6.  Program Execution: 
    a.  Sailors should submit requests for NSW SSRB to the program manager 60 
to 180 days prior to entering into an NSW SSRB contract via their chain of 
command.  If operational commitments limit the ability to submit SSRB 
applications via this manner, commands should submit requests through their 
immediate superior in the chain of command who can submit the request to the 
program manager. 
    b.  Upon acceptance of an agreement of the Sailor by the program manager, 
the amount of the bonus becomes fixed and the Sailor incurs a firm service 
obligation. 
    c.  Sailors will receive the bonus in a lump sum payment, effective from 
the date of contract execution. 
    d.  SSRB requests for personnel who are being processed for disciplinary 
action, NEC removal, or restoration will be held in abeyance pending final 
resolution. 
 
7.  Payment Processing.  SSRB approval does not currently update the Navy 
Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) of the intent of the Sailor to 
reenlist.  Until NSIPS can be programmed to accept SSRB reenlistment 
payments, manual processing is required.  Payment should post to the account 
of the member by the second pay period following the day the SSRB program 
manager receives the notification of reenlistment.  Master Military Pay 
Account (MMPA) must reflect contract or obligated service for enlisted 
Sailors and tax-free status (if applicable) must post to MMPA prior to final 
payment. 
 
8.  Application.  The following documents are required: 
    a.  60-180 days prior to contract: 
        (1) Letter of the Sailor requesting a NSW SSRB contract. 
        (2) COs endorsement letter. 
    b.  Prior to payment, Sailors will submit a copy of reenlistment contract 
and/or extension agreement with proof of tax-free status, if applicable.
