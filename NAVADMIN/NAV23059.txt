RMKS/1.  As part of Navy's Get Real, Get Better movement, this NAVADMIN 
announces both the release of the Mental Health Playbook and the name change 
from the Navy 21st Century Sailor Office (OPNAV
N17) to the Navy Culture and Force Resilience Office.

2.  Download the Mental Health Playbook at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/ or
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/Culture-Resilience/Leaders-
Toolkit/Mental-Health-Playbook/.

3.  Mental Health Playbook (MHPB):
    a.  As a Navy, we must ensure that every member of our team - their 
minds, bodies, and spirits - are ready for combat, or for supporting those 
who go forward.  For this reason, ensuring our people's health, especially 
their mental health, is paramount.
    b.  A team of professionals from across the Fleet developed the MHPB to 
assist Navy leaders in preventing, mitigating, or addressing mental health 
issues.  It defines roles and responsibilities (from triad to deckplate), 
describes how to have conversations that matter, and helps leaders understand 
how to identify and respond to a mental health related concern, navigate 
support systems, and understand available mental health capabilities and 
resources.
    c.  Leaders at all levels should read the MHPB from cover to cover in the 
same way one would read a technical or tactical manual.
In addition, the MHPB contains a point of contact list that should be filled 
in and kept current at every Navy command.
    d.  The MHPB provides a link and QR code on page 24 to submit questions 
about the content, or comments about how to make the next version of the MHPB 
better.

4.  Navy Culture and Force Resilience Office:
    a.  Recognizing the challenge of adding the Get Real, Get Better mindset, 
leadership behaviors, and problem solving to an already complex set of 
personnel programs and policies, the Chief of Naval Operations tasked the 
Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Personnel, Manpower, and Training, N1, 
to advance Navy culture.
This work, led by OPNAV N17, will simplify, streamline, and align existing 
(e.g., Culture of Excellence) and new (e.g., Get Real, Get
Better) standards into an integrated approach for how the Navy will build its 
people, leaders, and teams.
    b.  The first step of this journey is the release of the MHPB and the 
change of OPNAV N17's name to one that more deliberately represents CNO's 
charge to advance Navy culture, ensuring we build a Force that is tougher and 
more resilient in how it comes together to solve our hardest problems, fight, 
and win.  In addition, OPNAV N17 has assumed ownership of Navigation Plan 
(NAVPLAN) Integration Framework (NIF) within reference (a) task to align 
Navy's toughness, resiliency, and mental health programs into one continuum.
    c.  Initial integration work will be developed, tested, and deployed by 
the end of calendar year 2023.  In calendar year 2024, the Navy will further 
adjust its talent management system to reflect a culture that rewards its 
people not only for the outcomes they achieve, but also for the culture and 
teams they build in achieving these outcomes.

5.  The OPNAV N17 section of the MyNavy HR website will be refined over the 
next year, but has been initially updated to reflect Navy's pivot towards 
more deliberately building great people, leaders, and
teams:
