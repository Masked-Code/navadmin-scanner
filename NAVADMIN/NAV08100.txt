RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE NAVY COUNSELORS ASSOCIATION
(NCA) 20TH ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM AT THE TOWN AND COUNTRY RESORT AND 
CONVENTION CENTER SAN DIEGO, CA FROM 21-25 JUL 08.  THIS YEAR'S THEME 
IS:  GETTING BRILLIANT ON THE BASICS.
2.  I REQUEST EVERY COMMAND MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE 
MEMBER OF THEIR COMMAND LEADERSHIP TEAM IN ATTENDANCE.  THIS SYMPOSIUM 
IS MY NUMBER-ONE FORUM TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE NC COMMUNITY ON 
RETENTION POLICIES, NEWS AND BEST PRACTICES.  RETAINING OUR BEST 
SAILORS IS A PRIORITY FOR EVERY NAVY LEADER, AND IT STARTS WITH HAVING 
THE BEST INFORMATION AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.
3.  THIS SYMPOSIUM OFFERS AN OUTSTANDING OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT 
CAREER DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES THAT MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN THE 
LIVES OF OUR SAILORS.  THE NCA SYMPOSIUM PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
DISCUSSION AND TRAINING ON A BROAD RANGE OF CAREER DEVELOPMENT 
PROCESSES AND POLICIES THAT FOCUS ON INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO RETENTION, 
ATTRITION, AND CAREER MANAGEMENT CONCERNS.  
PARTICIPATION BY CAREER DEVELOPMENT TEAM MEMBERS, INCLUDING COMMAND 
CAREER COUNSELORS AND COMMAND MASTER CHIEFS IS HIGHLY ENCOURAGED. 
RECRUITERS, DETAILERS, AND OTHER MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL 
INVOLVED IN SAILORS' PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ARE ALSO WELCOME.  
4.  EACH YEAR DURING THE SYMPOSIUM, THE NCA SELECTS TWO CAREER 
COUNSELORS OF THE YEAR, ONE FROM SEA DUTY (TYPE 2, 3 OR 4) AND ONE FROM 
SHORE DUTY (TYPE 1 OR 6).  COMMANDS MAY NOMINATE ASSIGNED CAREER 
COUNSELORS (E6 AND BELOW) USING THE FORMAT IN THE NCA BY-LAWS AVAILABLE 
AT WWW.USNCA.ORG.  NOMINATIONS SHOULD ADDRESS SPECIFIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS
