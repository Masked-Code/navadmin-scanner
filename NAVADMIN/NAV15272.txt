SUBJ/CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS THANKSGIVING MESSAGE 2015//

Rmks/1.  Team, Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays.
This weekend, many of us will gather with family, friends, and loved ones to 
celebrate each others' company over a nice meal in our homes.  Dana and I 
wish you a peaceful and safe weekend, and we thank YOU for all that you do to 
keep our Navy and nation prosperous and secure.

2.  As we take this time to pause and reflect, let us remember those who are 
quietly celebrating while underway or forward deployed around the world.  
While we take with family, they have the watch.  We've all been there and 
know those mixed feelings of pride at accomplishing the mission, but also 
missing our loved ones while deployed during this time.  For those at home, 
please keep these shipmates in your thoughts and prayers.  If you're forward, 
reach out, be good company for each other, and wish your shipmate a Happy 
Thanksgiving.

3.  Finally, I must add that in addition to turkey, pumpkin pie, and 
football, wherever you are, please add safety to your list of things to keep 
track of this weekend.  Remain alert and cognizant of your surroundings.  
Ensure you keep yourselves and those around you safe and sound.  You and your 
families are all far too valuable to the Navy and the nation to experience a 
needless accident - I need you all to come back rested and ready to go.

4.  Happy Thanksgiving!

5.  Released by ADM J. M. Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations.//
