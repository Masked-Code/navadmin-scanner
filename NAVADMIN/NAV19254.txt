RMKS/1.  Mission one for every Sailor, active and reserve, uniformed and 
civilian, is the operational readiness of todays Navy.  That means being 
ready both in our personal and professional lives.  And part of that 
readiness, as members of the profession of arms, is holding ourselves to high 
ideals of integrity and service.

2.  Sailors are our asymmetric advantage in a complex and changing 
environment.  Optimizing our Navy teams performance requires us all to drive 
toward a Culture of Excellence, a culture focused on the high ideals espoused 
in our Core Values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment.  In order to more 
effectively recruit, develop, manage, reward, and retain the forces of 
tomorrow, aiming to simply avoid doing the wrong thing is too low a bar; we 
must actively pursue that  which is right.  When Sailors feel included, 
respected, and empowered, they will be more ready to win wars, deter 
aggression and maintain freedom of the seas.

3.  This is not a tagline.  This is a call to action, and we must begin 
today.

4.  To reach this vision of cultural excellence, the Navy must evolve beyond 
simply responding to incidents after they occur.
Reactive strategies demand large amounts of our collective time and effort to 
target a relatively small population.  Instead, we must proactively prevent 
incidents from occurring in the first place.  We are hard at work developing 
the necessary guidance and tools to do so.
    a.  Soon, you will receive the following:
        (1) Communication guides for senior and deckplate leaders to further 
explain our way ahead.
        (2) Information on upcoming pilot programs designed to empower unit-
level commanders and their Command Resilience Teams to make data-driven 
decisions to get to the left of destructive behaviors.

5.  Over the last 6 months, we have been reviewing, simplifying and aligning 
our policies and programs that are duplicative or ineffective.  Before we ask 
you to do anything different, we will leverage this simplification to give 
deckplate leaders time back for training, qualifications, education, and 
everything else that promotes combat readiness.  We will continue to seek 
your feedback on these efforts.

6.  Navy senior leaders, myself especially, are listening.  We are committed 
to promoting your success.  You will soon see a follow-up 12 Star message 
from our Fleet Commanders, highlighting our unified commitment to signature 
behaviors.

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.

8.  Released by Admiral M. M. Gilday, Chief of Naval Operations.//
