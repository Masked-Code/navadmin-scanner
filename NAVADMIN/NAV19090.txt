all applicable sections of the APPLY application.
Applications must be submitted via the Reserve Forces Manpower Tools
(RFMT) at https://my.navy.mil/quick-links.html.  On the menu of the RFMT, 
click the NPC page and select APPLY Board.  Officers are encouraged to place 
the maximum number of billet choices on their dream sheet to maximize the 
opportunity for an assignment.
Likewise, applicants are highly encouraged to state their willingness to 
travel for billets not on their dream sheet, which will enable the board to 
select the best qualified applicants to fill unadvertised vacancies and other 
assignment opportunities.

3.  Applications must be finalized and billet preferences made via RFMT no 
later than 0800 Eastern Daylight Time on 24 June 2019.

4.  With the exception of the most recent O-6 periodic fitness report 
(FITREP) (addressed in paragraph 5 below), all correspondence to the board 
must be received no later than 2 August 2019.
Submission methods are detailed in paragraph 6 below.  Late correspondence 
will not be considered by the board.

5.  The July 2019 O-6 FITREPS will be accepted until 2359 Central Daylight 
Time on 5 August 2019 and should be submitted as an enclosure to a letter 
addressed to the APPLY Board President.
Enclosures, other than the July 2019 O-6 FITREP, submitted after the regular 
correspondence deadline in line with paragraph 4, will not be considered by 
the board.
