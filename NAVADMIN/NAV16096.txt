RMKS/1. Campaign Drug Free (CDF) is one of six "Flagship Programs" within the 
Navy Community Service Program.  Sailors and Marines who volunteer make a 
major difference by strengthening education, promoting health and fitness, 
providing humanitarian assistance, preserving the environment, and promoting 
anti-drug lifestyles.  Per reference (a), Commander, Navy Reserve Force is 
the executive agent for CDF, and each year the Navy recognizes the best 
programs that teach elementary, middle, and high school children about the 
dangers of drug abuse.  These exemplary community outreach programs have 
effectively reduced drug and alcohol abuse by children through outreach and 
education. Navy volunteers are role models who demonstrated how Honor, 
Courage, and Commitment can be used to further leadership and character 
development.

2. It is a great pleasure to announce the 2015 Campaign Drug Free Flagship 
Award winning commands:
a. Small Shore: Naval Aviation Schools Command, Pensacola, FL
b. Small Overseas: Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station, Guam
c. Medium Shore: Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit, Keesler AFB, Biloxi, 
MS
d. Large Shore: Naval Submarine Base, Kings Bay, GA
e. Large Overseas: U.S. Naval Hospital, Guam

3. CDF benefits Sailors' and Marines' communities by teaching children to 
avoid or stop the use of illicit drugs and alcohol.  This outreach 
demonstrates the sense of community responsibility of all Sailors, Marines, 
and Civilians. Congratulations to the 2015 winning commands.
