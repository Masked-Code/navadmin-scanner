SUBJ/UNIFORM BOARD UPDATE//

REF/A/DOC/NAVPERS 15665I/01JAN03//

AMPN/REF A IS U.S. NAVY UNIFORM REGULATIONS//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ADDRESSES THE SERVICE DRESS KHAKI (SDK) INITIATIVE.  
THIS INITIATIVE WAS INSTITUTED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO AS ONE MEANS TO FIND AN 
AFFORDABLE, OPTIONAL LIGHT WEIGHT DRESS UNIFORM FOR WEAR IN WARM 
WEATHER/SUMMER MONTHS WHERE A COAT AND TIE (UNIFORM) IS DEEMED MORE 
APPROPRIATE THAN SUMMER WHITE AND/OR SERVICE DRESS WHITE UNIFORMS.

2.  A COMPREHENSIVE UNIFORM ASSESSMENT, EVALUATING OPTIONS FOR A SDK UNIFORM, 
IS COMPLETE.  IT INCLUDED EVALUATION OF: (1) PROBABLE QUANTITIES OF SDK SETS 
ORDERED/SOLD, (2) WEAR TEST OF SEVERAL MODELS EVALUATING QUALITY, DURABILITY, 
APPEARANCE AND FIT, AND (3) ESTIMATED COST PER UNIFORM SET TO THE INDIVIDUAL.  
ULTIMATELY IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A NEW SET OF LIGHT WEIGHT SDKS, OF 
ACCEPTABLE QUALITY, ORDERED IN THE PROJECTED NUMBERS FROM THE ASSESSMENT, 
WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE TO THE CUSTOMER.  ACCORDINGLY, THE DECISION HAS BEEN 
MADE TO TERMINATE PURSUING THE SDK UNIFORM AS AN OPTIONAL UNIFORM.

3.  HOWEVER, FOR E7 THROUGH O10 PERSONNEL, THE SDB UNIFORM IS A SUITABLE 
ALTERNATIVE FOR WEAR IN LIEU OF SUMMER WHITE AND SERVICE DRESS WHITE UNIFORMS 
WHEN A COAT AND TIE IS APPROPRIATE.  PER REF A, SDB UNIFORMS MAY BE PRESCRIBED 
FOR WEAR YEAR-ROUND TO ALL OFFICIAL FUNCTIONS (WHEN FORMAL DRESS, DINNER 
DRESS, OR FULL DRESS UNIFORMS ARE NOT PRESCRIBED) AND CIVILIAN EQUIVALENT 
DRESS IS COAT AND TIE.
THE SDB UNIFORM IS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE IN A QUALITY LIGHT WEIGHT FABRIC.

4.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING LIGHT WEIGHT SDB FABRIC AND ORDER 
OPTIONS, AS WELL AS AVAILABILITY, WILL BE PROVIDED SEPCOR.
FOR QUESTIONS REGARDING UNIFORM POLICY, PLEASE CONTACT MR. ROBERT B. CARROLL, 
OPNAV N131U, AT ROBERT.B.CARROLL(AT)NAVY.MIL;
