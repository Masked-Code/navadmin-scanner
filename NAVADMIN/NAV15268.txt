RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides notice and information regarding the
2016 Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA)/ Electronic Tax Filing
(ELF) Program.  This message supersedes reference (a).

2.  The VITA/ELF Program is managed by Naval Legal Service Command to provide 
free electronic tax filing services for Sailors, Dependents, and Retirees 
with a focus on assisting Servicemembers E6 and below.
Last year, fleet volunteers helped thousands of Servicemembers and Dependents 
avoid paying tax preparation fees.  In fact, in Tax Year 2014, volunteers 
with the program saved Servicemembers and Dependents an estimated $884,000 in 
tax preparation fees and provided over 17 million dollars in expedited tax 
refunds.

3.  This program reduces the effort and cost involved in preparing and filing 
federal and state tax returns.
    a.  Volunteers assist Sailors and Dependents at no cost.
    b.  Refunds are deposited an average of two weeks from the date of 
filing, reducing the lure of commercial refund anticipation loans which have 
high interest rates and fees.

4.  Self-service tax preparation, using free tax filing software, is 
available to all Sailors, Dependents, and qualifying Retirees to file their 
tax returns at Continental United States and Outside Continental United 
States tax centers.  Tax centers are staffed by IRS trained and certified 
volunteers to assist with tax filing.

5.  Commands must ensure Sailors are aware of their personal responsibility 
to file tax returns and that free Navy services are available to them.

6.  Tax assistance centers depend on local commands for personnel, equipment, 
and facilities.  This program merits serious consideration in every command?s 
allocation of manpower and resources and is a particularly good use of 
talented Limited Duty Sailors.
    a.  Commands are encouraged to identify those who are willing to work as 
full or part-time volunteers at tax centers.
    b.  Volunteers require training in advance of assignment to a tax center.  
Volunteers will be advised of training sessions by tax center managers prior 
to execution of duties.  Commands that can provide Sailors as VITA/ELF 
volunteers should contact their local Region Legal Service Office as soon as 
possible.  Region Legal Service Office contact information can be accessed at 
the following web address:
www.jag.navy.mil/legal_services/legal_services_locator_RLSO.htm.
    c.  Commands interested in setting up their own program should contact LT 
Peter Marx at the office of the Judge Advocate General (Code 16) at (202) 
685-4637 DSN: 325-4637 or peter.marx(at)navy.mil.
