PROGRAM.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the FY-18 Full-Time Support (FTS) Aviation 
Department Head Retention Bonus (ADHRB) program in line with reference (a).  
A vital part of developing a total force strategy and maintaining combat 
readiness is to provide appropriate incentives to retain skilled personnel 
for critical naval aviation enterprise billets.  The FTS ADHRB program 
provides selected bonuses as an incentive to eligible pilots and naval flight 
officers (NFO) through department head (DH) billets.

2.  The FY-18 FTS ADHRB program continues the bonus system of previous years 
that is tied directly to force structure and targets initial eligible 
aviators.  Annual rates for the 3 year contracts are listed below and vary by 
community from $5,000 to $28,000 for squadron DH.  DH retention bonuses will 
be paid in equal annual installments.  The FTS ADHRB rates for FY-18 are:

    HM  Pilot            $15,000/YR ($45,000 total)
    HSC  Pilot           $15,000/YR ($45,000 total)
    HSM  Pilot           $15,000/YR ($45,000 total)
    HT  Pilot            $5,000/YR  ($15,000 total)
    VAQ - Pilot/NFO      $18,000/YR ($54,000 total)
    VFA/C - Pilot/NFO    $28,000/YR ($84,000 total)
    VP - Pilot/NFO       $15,000/YR ($45,000 total)

    VT(JET) - Pilot/NFO  $15,000/YR ($45,000 total)
    VT(PROP) - Pilot/NFO $10,000/YR ($30,000 total)

between 1 October 2017 and the FY-18 FTS ADHRB Program NAVADMIN release date 
are eligible to apply for a limited time.
