SUBJ/COAST GUARD BIRTHDAY MESSAGE// 

RMKS/1.  ON BEHALF OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY, I EXTEND MY 
SINCERE APPRECIATION TO ALL COAST GUARDSMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES AS WE OBSERVE 
THE 221ST BIRTHDAY OF THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD ON 4 AUGUST 2011.

2.  SINCE ALEXANDER HAMILTON FOUNDED THE REVENUE CUTTER SERVICE WELL OVER TWO 
CENTURIES AGO, THE SECURITY PROVIDED BY YOU AND YOUR FOREBEARS HAS BEEN A RARE 
CONSTANT IN OUR DYNAMIC MARITIME DOMAIN.
WITH MISSIONS RANGING FROM ASSISTANCE TO MARINERS ALONG OUR COASTS, TO 
MARITIME SECURITY OPERATIONS IN THE EXTREME NORTHERN ARABIAN GULF AND 
ELSEWHERE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, COAST GUARD CUTTERS PATROL CEASELESSLY, 
PURPOSEFULLY, AND WITHOUT FANFARE TO CARRY OUT COMPLEX MISSIONS VITAL TO THE 
NATIONAL INTEREST.

3.  AS THE COAST GUARD CELEBRATES ANOTHER YEAR OF SUCCESS AND SERVICE , WE AS 
AMERICANS AND MEMBERS OF THE SEA SERVICES FACE NEW CHALLENGES THAT WILL 
REQUIRE MORE FROM THOSE WHO GO TO SEA IN SHIPS.  FOR YOUR UNWAVERING VIGILANCE 
AND READINESS, OUR CITIZENS OWE YOU A DEBT OF GRATITUDE.  FOR YOUR TRADITION 
OF EXCELLENCE, YOUR FLEXIBILITY TO IMPACT EVENTS LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY, AND 
CERTAINLY FOR OUR CLOSE BOND AS FELLOW SEAFARERS, KNOW YOU HAVE THE DEEPEST 
GRATITUDE AND RESPECT OF NAVY MEN AND WOMEN EVERYWHERE.  YOU REMAIN AN 
INSPIRATION TO US ALL.

4.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SHIPMATES.  WE ARE PROUD TO SERVE ALONGSIDE YOU.

5.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
