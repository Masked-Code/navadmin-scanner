RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance for the administration of the 
September 2023 (cycle 260) Navy-wide advancement exam (NWAE) cycle as well as 
modification to the Selected Reserve (SELRES) August 2023 (cycle 113) NWAE 
cycle.  All Active Duty (AD), Training and Administration of the Reserve 
(TAR), and SELRES paygrades E-5 and E-6 will take NWAEs to compete for 
advancement.  All AD, TAR, and SELRES E-4 candidates will compete for 
advancement via a modified alternative final multiple score (A-FMS). 
 
2.  In line with references (a) and (b), the enlisted advancement worksheet 
(EAW) is the authoritative source of all data used to determine cycle 260 
candidates for E-4, E-5, and E-6 eligibility. Commands are to accurately 
validate, complete, and finalize all EAWs in the Navy Standard Integrated 
Personnel System (NSIPS).  EAW discrepancies may be addressed via the post-
exam administration comment (PAC) process after worksheets are locked for the 
cycle. 
 
3.  Cycle 260 Timeline: 
    a.  31 July 2023.  Professional Military Knowledge – Eligibility Exam 
(PMK-EE) completion deadline (E-5 and E-6 candidates).  In line with 
reference (c), PMK-EE remains mandatory once per paygrade for all E-5 and E-6 
candidates to be eligible for NWAE cycle participation.  Refer to reference 
(d) regarding special exceptions for new accessions. 
    b.  7 September 2023.  E-6 exam administration.  EAW will close one week 
after the exam date on the worksheet. 
    c.  14 September 2023.  E-5 exam administration.  EAW will close one week 
after the exam date on the worksheet. 
    d.  21 September 2023.  E-4 EAW must be completed. 
    e.  Deviation from administration dates.  In line with reference (a), 
commands that require reschedule of NWAE administration date (with valid 
reason) may request a deviation of NWAE administration from Enlisted 
Administrative Selection Board Branch (PERS-803).  If authorized, NWAE 
administration will be completed by 30 September 2023. 
 
4.  E-4 Advancement and Eligibility Changes: 
    a.  To support transition to time-in-service (TIS) based advancements to 
E-4, the Fall 2023 advancement cycles (260 and 113) for E-4 advancements will 
be adjusted to transition the force over the next year.  Specifically, 
calculations via a modified A-FMS will be heavily weighted towards longer 
Time-In-Rate (TIR), with increased quotas for ratings with historically 
slower advancement timing, and no requirement to complete PMK-EE for E-
4.  The A-FMS computations will supersede the E-4 FMS computations in 
reference (e) and factor points in reference (f). 
    b.  In order to facilitate this transition, commands are directed to 
finalize or certify all Fall NWAE cycle E-4 EAWs in NSIPS as "Eligible for 
Advancement" or "Not Eligible for Advancement".  The only criteria necessary 
to validate advancement eligibility are required TIR and current commanding 
officer's (CO) advancement recommendation.  Each Sailor's Educational 
Services Officer (ESO) must certify E-4 EAWs as eligible if these two 
conditions are met.  This guidance modifies reference (g) and applies to all 
E-4 candidates (AD, TAR, and SELRES). 
    c.  As a modification to references (a), (b), (c) and (h), the 
requirement for E-4 candidates to complete PMK-EE to be eligible for 
advancement to E-4 has been removed for cycles 260 and 113. 
 
5.  Cycle 260 eligibility requirements: 
    a.  Terminal eligibility date (TED).  1 January 2024. 
    b.  Minimum TIR.  On or before 1 January 2021 for  E-6, 1 January 2023 
for E-5, 1 July 2023 for E-4. 
    c.  E-6 candidate TIR requirements for early promote (EP) can be waived 
by one year with CO or officer-in-charge (OIC) approval.  EAW must be created 
manually for all who receive that waiver.  Early promote candidates are still 
bound by the same PMK-EE deadline as regular TIR candidates. 
    d.  High-year tenure (HYT) date.  In line with reference (i), all HYT 
dates through 30 September 2024 are suspended.  All Fleet Reserve or 
Retirement requests prior to this date are considered voluntary.  In the EAW, 
the "HYT Exceeded" entry may reflect "Yes" - when applicable, select "Yes" 
for "HYT Waived". 
    e.  Security/Interim security clearance (if required).  Refer to chapter 
2 of reference (a).  All E-5 and E-6 NWAE candidates must have applicable 
adjudication (Top Secret or Secret) or CO/OIC interim clearance dated prior 
to 1 September 2023.  If clearance is revoked, an exam is not authorized 
until the discrepancy is corrected. 
    f.  Performance Mark average (PMA).  Compute PMA for all E-4 and E-5 
candidates and Reporting Senior's Cumulative Average (RSCA) PMA for E-6 
candidates in line with references (a) and (e).  Use all applicable 
evaluations in current paygrade with an ending date that falls within the 
following periods: 
        (1) E-4 - 1 January 2023 to 31 August 2023. 
        (2) E-5 - 1 June 2022 to 31 August 2023. 
        (3) E-6 - 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2023.
