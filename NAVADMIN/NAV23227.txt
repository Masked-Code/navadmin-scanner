RMKS/1.  This message shall be read in its entirety to ensure all 
stakeholders in the ship inactivation process are aware of the projected 
retirement schedule for the upcoming fiscal year 2024 (FY24), their 
respective responsibilities, necessary follow-up actions, and planning 
required. Subject to Congressional approval of the President's Budget 
submission for fiscal year 2024, the following ship retirement decisions 
reflected in paragraph 2 have been proposed.  This plan will be adjusted if 
necessary based on subsequent execution year decisions made by leadership or 
as required by Congressional action. 
 
2.  To facilitate fleet planning efforts to conduct decommissioning 
continuous maintenance availability (CMAV) or inactivation availability 
(INAC), the projected schedule for inactivating U.S. battle force naval 
vessels which have met or exceeded their Expected Service Lives in FY24 is 
promulgated as follows: 
 
Ship Name                        Proj Inactive Date       Post Inactive 
Status 
USS ANTIETAM (CG 54)                 28 JUN 24                    LSA 
USS LEYTE GULF (CG 55)               27 SEP 24                    LSA 
USS SAN JUAN (SSN 751)               12 AUG 24                  RECYCLE 
 
3.  Additional ships identified to be decommissioned in the President's 
Budget submission for FY24 and the FY24 30-year shipbuilding plan will be 
addressed following Congressional review of the submitted budget.  Additional 
guidance on any additional ship retirements will be codified in a follow-on 
NAVADMIN.  Consistent with the law, no actions shall be taken on additional 
ship retirements until such time Congressional direction is provided in the 
National Defense Authorization Act for FY24 and the FY24 Department of 
Defense Appropriations Act. 
 
4.  Per reference (b), Fleet Commanders shall submit an Organizational Change 
Request for commissioned U.S. ships to formally notify the Office of the 
Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) of a ship's decommissioning, inactivation, 
or end of service.  Submit revisions due to operational schedule changes per 
references (a) and (b).  It is the responsibility of Commander, U.S. Fleet 
Forces Command and Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet in coordination with their 
respective TYCOM to ensure the appropriate lower echelon commands are 
notified of any changes in the ship inactivation schedules, as well as 
Integrated Warfare (OPNAV N9I) and OPNAV resource sponsor. 
 
5.  Adjustments to paragraph 2 ship inactivations that cross the current 
fiscal year must be coordinated with OPNAV N9I due to Congressional 
requirements for execution year force structure changes that differ from what 
Congress authorized/appropriated and signed into law by the President.  OPNAV 
shall promulgate changes to the inactivation fiscal year as required. 
 
6.  Per reference (a), the ships listed in paragraph 2 as Logistics Support 
Assets (LSA) will be used as a primary means of cannibalization and equipment 
removal for ships.  Cannibalizations and equipment removal from these vessels 
is authorized without replacement. 
 
7.  The ship's commanding officer, master, or Immediate Superior In Command 
shall submit a final naval message (normally transmitted in conjunction with 
the decommissioning ceremony) announcing the ship's official retirement date 
and include a brief history of the significant events in the life of the ship 
per reference (a).  The Naval History and Heritage Command (NAVHISTHERITAGE 
WASHINGTON DC) and Naval Vessel Register Custodian (NVR NORFOLK VA) shall be 
included as INFO addees.
