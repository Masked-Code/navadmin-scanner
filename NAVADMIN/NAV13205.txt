Gentext/remarks/1.  Exercise-Exercise-Exercise - Tthis message
applies to all Navy personnel, uniformed and civilian.  Echelon II
Commanders and all regional Commanders shall ensure widest
dissemination to all subordinate and tenant commands and detachments
for immediate action upon receipt.

2.  The following geographic areas of interest (GAOI) have been
established for NRSW.
    a.  California:
        (1) the following counties and cities in the state of CA:
Inyo, Kern, Kings, San Bernadino.
    b.  Nevada:
        (1) the following counties and cities in the state of NV:

3.  Due to the constraints of the exercise timeline, personnel
accountability (PA) reporting for this order to account will be
conducted beginning 1530Z, 20AUG13 and will continue until the
personnel accountability objective for this exercise meets the
satisfaction of USFF and DCNO (N1).  Commands are expected to
execute PA to 100 percent compliance within 72 hour timeline upon PA
commencement.  Should a real world catastrophic event develop during
the exercise, Citadel Rumble play will be suspended to avoid
confusion.

4.  All commands are expected to:
    a.  Muster and account for all affected personnel, including
applicable family members.  Commanding officers (COs) and/or
Commanding Officers representatives (CORs) are to determine accurate
status and whereabouts of their personnel and muster and account for
them at current residence, displaced location, or not in the GAOI
with specified circumstance (deployed, tdy/tad/ia, on leave,
separated/retired, transferred, UA/deserter, other).  In doing so,
an accurate accounting of all personnel in all accounting categories
can be quickly determined.
    b.  COs and/or CORs utilize the Navy Family Accountability and
Assessment system (NFAAS) support site at
https://navyfamily.navy.mil to account for each individual required
to be reported per refs (a) and (b).
    c.  Individuals or family members not able to contact their
command can log on to NFAAS at https://navyfamily.navy.mil and check
in (muster) on the Navy Family Members site.  If unable to log on to
NFAAS, call the NFAAS help desk at 866-946-9183.
    d.  If NFAAS is not available, commands are to report the status
of PA to the affected region operations center (ROC) or direct chain
of command.
    e.  Do not delay reporting on personnel until all information is
complete.  Report and account mustering information when obtained
including the posting of amplifying data in the notes area on the
individual's accounting line.

5.  Commands executing evacuation procedures are responsible for
issuing TDY evacuation orders for their personnel, military and
civilian employees, and family members using DoD form 1610.
Military members departing the area being evacuated are on TDY
status and will receive normal TDY allowances.  Commands day-to-day
operations funding source is to be used per ref (c).  For civilian
employees and family members of military and civilian personnel, the
funding accounting data is outlined in refs (d) and (e).

6.  Displaced personnel who have been ordered to evacuate by
military authority, can email the Navy Pay and Personnel Support
Center (NPPSC), Norfolk, VA at evacuations(at)navy.mil for
evacuation travel related questions.
    a.  The decision of local civil officials to evacuate an area is
not sufficient for DoD reimbursement entitlements.  The appropriate
military official must authorize/order an evacuation as local civil
officials cannot obligate the expenditure of DoD funds.
    b.  Commands will designate safe havens for evacuated personnel.
    c.  Upon arrival at the designated safe haven, all personnel
muster in accordance with parent command direction.

7.  Navy families are strongly encouraged to log into NFAAS,
https://navyfamily.navy.mil, to update contact information at their
earliest convenience.  For further assistance, call Navy Personnel
Command Emergency Coordination Center (NPC Emergency Coordination
Center (ECC)) at 877-414-5358 or e-mail npc.cat.captain(at)navy.mil.
