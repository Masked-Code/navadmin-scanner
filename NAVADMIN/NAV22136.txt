RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the guidance for the administration of the 
fall 2022 (cycle 111) Navy-wide Advancement Exam (NWAE) for Selected Reserve 
(SELRES) Sailors in paygrades E-5 through E-6 and E-4 Prior Service 
Reenlistment Eligibility Reserve (PRISE-R) candidates and the use of an 
alternative final multiple score (FMS) rank-order method without an exam for 
all other SELRES E-4 advancement candidates.  E-4 candidates (with the 
exception of PRISE-R) will not participate in an exam, but will be given the 
opportunity for advancement using an alternative FMS rank-order method, 
without the inclusion of an exam score from a proctored exam.  E-4 PRISE-R, 
E-5 and E-6 candidates will be administered NWAEs in August per reference 
(a).  All candidates serving on voluntary recall, mobilization or as 
Canvasser Recruiters (CANREC) will compete for advancement as a SELRES. 
 
2.  Timeline 
    a.  30 June 2022:  Professional Military Knowledge – Eligibility Exam 
(PMK-EE) completion deadline. 
    b.  1-31 August 2022:  E-4 PRISE-R, E-5 and E-6 exam administration. 
    c.  31 August 2022:  Enlisted advancement worksheet (EAW) completion due 
date.  E-4 (with the exception of PRISE-R) exams are cancelled, but EAWs must 
still be completed by this date. 
 
3.  Eligibility Requirements.  For all E-4 through E-6 candidates, 
eligibility requirements are found in chapter 2 of reference (a), with the 
following information specific only to cycle 111: 
    a.  The terminal eligibility date used to compute time in rate (TIR) for 
E-4 through E-6 is 1 January 2023. 
    b.  The minimum TIR date must be on or before: 
        (1) E-6 - 1 January 2020 
        (2) E-5 - 1 January 2022 
        (3) E-4 - 1 July 2022 
    c.  E-6 candidate TIR requirements for early promote (EP) Sailors can be 
waived by one year with commanding officer (CO)/officer in charge (OIC) 
approval, in line with paragraph 214 of reference (a).  Cycle 111 EAW must be 
manually created for all E-6 EP TIR waiver authorized candidates. 
    d.  High-year tenure (HYT) date for E-4 through E-6 must be effective  
1 January 2023, or later.  HYT waivers must be approved prior to 1 August 
2022 to be able to participate in cycle 111. 
    e.  Candidates who have submitted a formal written request for voluntary 
transfer to the retired reserve (with or without pay) or Fleet Reserve on a 
date prior to their mandated HYT are ineligible for advancement. 
    f.  Candidates in a rating requiring a security clearance must have a 
favorable investigation adjudication by the Department of Defense central 
adjudication facility reflected properly in the Defense Information System 
for Security (DISS) prior to 1 August 2022.  If the CO of the candidate 
grants an interim clearance, it must be entered in DISS prior to 1 August 
2022.  Candidates must maintain security clearance eligibility throughout the 
advancement cycle to be eligible for advancement.  If, for any reason, a 
clearance is denied, revoked or not reflected in DISS, an exam is not 
authorized and commands will not allow candidates to take the exam until the 
discrepancy is corrected or a new clearance is granted and is properly 
reflected in the candidates EAW.  Ratings requiring a security clearance are 
AC, AE, AG, AO, AT, AWF, AWO, AWR, AWS, AZ, CTI, CTN, CTR, CTT, EOD, ET, ETV, 
FC, FCA, GM, HT, IS, IT, ITS, LN, MA, MC, MMA, MN, ND, OS, QM, SB, SO, STG, 
STS, TM and YN.  Refer to references (a) and (b) for additional guidance. 
    g.  Branch class and special program indicator (SPI) code.  All SELRES 
including CANREC are required to take the cycle 111 SELRES NWAE.  Training 
and Administration of the Reserves (TAR), although still referred to as FTS 
in some systems, with a SPI code of V will take cycle 256 (E-4 through E-6) 
Active-Duty NWAEs. 
    h.  For candidates eligible for advancement to E-4 and E-5, compute 
performance mark average (PMA) using all applicable evaluations in the 
current pay grade of the candidate with an ending date that falls within the 
following periods: 
        (1) E-4 - 1 January 2022 to 31 July 2022 
        (2) E-5 - 1 June 2021 to 31 July 2022 
    i.  For candidates eligible for advancement to E-6, calculate the 
reporting seniors cumulative average (RSCA) PMA, as outlined in reference 
(d), using evaluations in the current paygrade of the candidate with the 
ending date that falls within the time period 1 August 2019 to 31 July 2022. 
    j.  Refer to reference (d) and paragraph 308 of reference (a) for 
additional guidance on RSCA PMA and PMA including guidance on establishing 
PMA for new accessions that have graduated from *A* school and do not have a 
current evaluation. 
    k.  For guidance on establishing EAW user roles and completing 
worksheets, refer to reference (e).  EAW is mandatory for cycle 111 and will 
be the authority for PMA, RSCA PMA and awards. 
    l.  PMK-EE is mandatory for all cycle 111 candidates competing for 
advancement, even if no NWAE is being administered, and must be successfully 
completed once for the exam paygrade.  E6 EP TIR waiver candidates are not 
exempt from completing the PMK-EE requirement by the deadline.  Commands must 
identify candidates early and Sailors should be completing PMK-EE requirement 
to be eligible for participation ahead of an advancement cycle.  The PMK-EE 
completion deadline is 30 June 2022, in accordance with reference (f).  No 
Sailor competing for advancement shall be permitted to participate in the 
advancement cycle without having a completed PMK-EE for the exam 
paygrade.  For E-3 and E-4 new accession candidates authorized PMK-EE 
completion deadlines, refer to references (h) and (i). 
    m.  PRISE-R Sailors required to participate in the NWAE to complete their 
rate conversion are only required to complete the PMK-EE if they are an E-3 
and are eligible for advancement in conjunction with testing to complete rate 
conversion. 
    n.  Commands must accurately validate, complete and finalize all EAWs in 
the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).  E-4 EAW accuracy is 
critical since Navy Enlisted Advancement System (NEAS) will be reprogrammed 
to use finalized E-4 EAWs (with the exception of PRISE-R) rather than the 
candidate exam answer sheets to create E-4 candidate records.  The success of 
this process will be dependent upon the accurate completion of E-4 EAWs to 
establish advancement cycle participation.  Cycle 111 E-4 EAWs must be 
completed by 31 August 2022. 
 
4.  Exam ordering.  Order exams in line with chapter 4 of reference (a). 
    a.  Deploying commands and candidates departing to congressionally-
designated combat zones and approved contingency operations areas (CDCZ/ACOA) 
can order exams up to six months prior to the scheduled exam date.  For 
additional guidance, refer to chapter 4 and paragraph 614 of reference (a). 
    b.  Sensitive compartmented information (SCI) exams. 
Cryptologic technician interpretive (CTI), cryptologic technician 
networks (CTN) and cryptologic technician collection (CTR) SCI exam 
ordering requirements can be found on the NEAS website via MyNavy 
Portal at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/command-
information.  Select Command Advancement Tools, then NEAS 
website.  Educational Services Officers (ESOs) must verify initial TIR 
eligibility lists on the NEAS website for exam ordering. 
Supplemental SCI exams are ordered via message-formatted e-mail to 
sfly_cryptologic.products(at)navy.mil or naval message following the 
guidelines with chapter 4 of reference (a).  Check NEAS Web for additional 
exam ordering information. 
    c.  Non-SCI Exams.  Exam ordering requirements can be found on 
the NEAS website via MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/command-
information.  Select Command Advancement Tools, then NEAS Website. 
ESOs must verify TIR eligibility lists on the NEAS website. 
        (1) Eligible candidates who were not added to the initial TIR list 
can be added to a supplemental TIR list.  The deadline to order supplemental 
SELRES exams is 31 August 2022. 
    d.  All candidate exam orders not included on the initial TIR list must 
be ordered in NEAS web by entering a Department of Defense identification 
(DoD ID) for each candidate instead of by e-mail or naval message.  This is a 
change to guidelines in chapter 4 of reference (a). 
    e.  Exams for CDCZ/ACOA Sailors or recalled reservists will be ordered by 
the command holding the service record of the service member.  Authority is 
granted for these candidates to be administered exams with the active duty 
exam administration. However, all SELRES including CANREC candidates are 
still required to take the cycle 111 SELRES exam and not the cycle 256 (E-4 
through E-6) active duty exam. 
    f.  When an exam is not used during the normally scheduled event, do not 
destroy the exam prior to 1 October 2022. 
    g.  Cycle 111 exams should only be administered from 1-31 August 
2022.  Refer to paragraphs 4.g.(1) and 4.g.(2) below for requests to retain 
exams for late administration on a next drill weekend in September 
2022.  Approved late administrations must be administered prior to 1 October 
2022.  Administration for all late exam administrations will follow 
guidelines in references (a) and paragraph 4.f.(1) and 4.f.(2). 
        (1) Since SELRES candidates may take the NWAE anytime from 
1-31 August 2022, annual training (AT) and additional duty for training (ADT) 
orders are not a valid reason for Sailors to take the late exam.  ESOs shall 
ensure that Sailors take the NWAE prior to going on AT/ADT orders or when 
Sailors return from their AT/ADT.  If a Sailor will be on AT/ADT during the 
entire time of the scheduled advancement exam window, then the ESO shall 
coordinate with the gaining command to forward the Sailor's exam and EAW. 
        (2) Naval Education and Training Professional Development Center 
(NETPDC) (N321) has the final approval for all late exam administration 
requests, but all SELRES late administration requests must come through the 
Navy Reserve Force ESOs prior to contacting NETPDC.  The Command ESO must e-
mail the Navy Reserve Force ESOs at CNRFC_Reserve_Forces_ESO(at)navy.mil and 
carbon copy their immediate superior in command ESOs for validation of their 
late exam administration request.  Once the Reserve Force ESOs validate the 
reason of the request, the command ESO will request approval from 
NETPDC to allow the Sailor to take the late exam.  A request for approval 
from NETPDC must be submitted with justification via e-mail 
to sfly_N321_exam_order(at)navy.mil for permission to retain exams for late 
administration on a next drill weekend in September 2022. Ensure the reason 
for a requested delay and Commander, Navy Reserve Forces command ESO 
validation are included. 
    h.  ESOs must verify the exam orders at the *View Previous Exam Orders* 
link via the NEAS website within seven to ten days of placing the order.  If 
exam order discrepancies are noted, contact the fleet services branch, NETPDC 
(N321) as listed on the NEAS website at NETPDC (N321) point of contact table. 
 
5.  Exam administration and answer sheet returns. 
    a.  Every effort should be made to ensure appropriate COVID-19 mitigation 
measures are in place, in line with reference (g). 
    b.  Following the administration of exams, it is critical that ESOs 
expeditiously mail in answer sheet packages to NETPDC (N321). Do not hold 
exams until the end of the testing month.  Prompt return of answer sheets 
will help ensure results are released in a timely manner.  For answer sheet 
return instructions, refer to chapter 6 of reference (a). 
    b.  ESOs must check the exam tote board on the NEAS website often to 
ensure answer sheets have been received and processed.  The tote board can be 
accessed via MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/command-
information.  Select Command Advancement Tools, then Exam Toteboard. 
Answer sheets with errors will not be counted until they are processed 
successfully. 
    c.  All eligible candidates serving on voluntary recall, mobilization or 
as CANREC will compete for advancement as a SELRES and participate in this 
advancement cycle. 
 
6.  Discrepancy Correction 
    a.  A detailed discrepancy list can be found at the NEAS website via 
MyNavy Portal.  For guidance on discrepancy correction requirements, refer to 
chapters 3 and 7 of reference (a). 
    b.  Post-exam administration discrepancy correction correspondence with 
NETPDC (N321) is to be submitted using the EAW post-exam administration 
comments (PAC) function, refer to reference (e).  All corrections must have 
CO/OIC letter and supporting documentation included as 
attachments.  Education point corrections require a submission of a screen 
shot of the joint service transcript display indicating the degree type and 
date of completion. 
    c.  For guidance on E-4 through E-6 candidates with missed exams due to 
assignment in CDCZ/ACOA, refer to chapter 6 of reference (a). A missed exam 
cycle EAW is required to be completed by selecting *Missed Cycle/IA* entry in 
the *EAW Special Circumstances* data entry field.
