SUBJ/SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH// 

RMKS/1.  SEXUAL ASSAULTS ARE CRIMES THAT DEVASTATE VICTIMS, UNDERMINE
 TEAMWORK, THREATEN UNIT COHESIVENESS AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE FLEET 
READINESS.  NAVY HAS A "ZERO TOLERANCE" SEXUAL ASSAULT POLICY WHICH 
REQUIRES ACTIVE SUPPORT FROM ALL OF US. 

2.  APRIL IS NATIONAL SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH (SAAM).  THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) THEME IS - "HURTS ONE, AFFECTS ALL.  
PREVENTING SEXUAL ASSAULT IS EVERYONE'S DUTY."  SEXUAL ASSAULT 
AWARENESS MONTH PROVIDES AN IDEAL OPPORTUNITY FOR UNITS AROUND THE 
WORLD TO DEDICATE FOCUSED ATTENTION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ELIMINATING 
THIS CRIME.  EVENTS PLANNED FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH SHOULD 
INCLUDE THE MESSAGE THAT WE MUST COLLECTIVELY DO MORE TO ENSURE THESE 
ATTACKS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. 

3.  LEADERS ACROSS THE NAVY SHOULD ADDRESS TWO QUESTIONS WHEN PLANNING 
ACTIVITIES - (1) WHAT IS OUR ORGANIZATION PLANNING TO DO? (2) WHAT ARE 
WE ASKING OUR SHIPMATES TO DO DIFFERENTLY TO ELIMINATE SEXUAL 
ASSAULTS?  THROUGHOUT APRIL, FOCUS EVENTS ON SUPPORTING ACTIONS THAT 
EMPHASIZE A CLIMATE THAT VALUES RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR, ACTIVE BYSTANDER 
INTERVENTION, AND SAFETY FROM SEXUAL ASSAULT FOR ALL.  ENGAGE THE PAO 
AND SEXUAL ASSAULT RESPONSE COORDINATOR (SARC) TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS 
TO IMPART THESE MESSAGES. 

4.  2011 CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES.  PREVIOUS SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH 
FLEET-WIDE ACTIVITIES INCLUDED WATERFRONT LEADERSHIP/FIRST RESPONDER 
TRAINING, FORUMS, COMMAND GENERAL MILITARY TRAINING (GMT) AND 
WORKSHOPS, INFORMATION BOOTHS, MEDIA EVENTS, AND SPORTS AND ATHLETIC 
TRAINING EVENTS (RUN/WALK) THAT FEATURED A SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS 
THEME. 
    A.  CONSIDER ENGAGING SAILORS TO POST A TAG LINE TO THEIR OUTGOING
EMAIL TRAFFIC AND PERSONAL FACEBOOK PAGE THAT DEMONSTRATES THEIR 
SOLIDARITY TO THE NAVY'S ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY SUCH AS:
        (1) "INTEGRITY IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR CONDUCT, RESPECT FOR 
OTHERS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR CHARACTER" OR,
        (2) "HONOR, COURAGE, COMMITMENT... MORE THAN JUST WORDS... MY 
NAVY WAY OF LIFE!"  THESE STATEMENTS ARE SIMPLE, REINFORCE NAVY ETHOS 
AND UNDERSCORE THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN SEXUAL ASSAULT AND NAVY CORE 
VALUES.
    B.  DOWNLOADABLE POSTERS, A NAVY POSTER, FACILITATOR'S GUIDE AND 
MATERIALS TO SUPPORT THE 2011 SAAM CAMPAIGN ARE AVAILABLE FROM THE 
DOD SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE OFFICE (SAPRO) AT: 
HTTP://WWW.SAPR.MIL/INDEX.PHP/SAAM/2011-MATERIALS.
NAVY COMMANDS CAN USE THESE MATERIALS FOR DISPLAYS ON THE QUARTERDECK 
AND THROUGHOUT COMMAND SPACES DURING THE MONTH OF APRIL.  ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE NATIONAL SEXUAL VIOLENCE RESOURCE 
CENTER (NSVRC) AT WWW.NSVRC.ORG, LOCAL SARCS, AND CNIC'S FLEET AND 
FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM LINK AT WWW.NFFSP.ORG.  

5.  FACTS AND FIGURES.  SEXUAL ASSAULT IS CONSIDERED THE MOST 
UNDER-REPORTED CRIME IN AMERICA.  IN FY10, NAVY AVERAGED 37 REPORTED 
SEXUAL ASSAULTS EVERY MONTH - THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF INCIDENTS IS 
BELIEVED TO BE HIGHER.  THE MAJORITY OF NAVY CASES, 65 PERCENT, WERE 
BLUE-ON-BLUE ATTACKS.  ALL RANKS, AGES AND GENDERS COMPRISE NAVY 
SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS AND PERPETRATORS.  THE HIGHEST VICTIM 
DEMOGRAPHIC IS E1-E4 (67 PERCENT), 20-24 YEARS OLD (51 PERCENT).  THE 
HIGHEST DEMOGRAPHIC OF KNOWN OFFENDERS IS E1-E4 (51 PERCENT), 20-24 
YEARS OLD (47 PERCENT).  THE MAJORITY OF THE VICTIMS KNOW THEIR 
ATTACKER. 

6.  A SEXUAL ASSAULT REVERBERATES THROUGH A UNIT, DEGRADING READINESS 
BY HARMING THE LIFE OF THE VICTIM AND THE TEAM'S ABILITY TO WORK 
EFFECTIVELY TOGETHER.  WE ALL PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN PREVENTING 
SEXUAL ASSAULT.  UNIT-LEVEL ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY THIS MONTH, ARE 
TANGIBLE WAYS FOR LEADERS AT ALL LEVELS TO DEMONSTRATE SUPPORT AND 
REINFORCE A UNIT CULTURE OF PREVENTION.  WITH YOUR CONTINUED 
LEADERSHIP, WE CAN ELIMINATE THIS REPREHENSIBLE CRIME FROM OUR NAVY.
