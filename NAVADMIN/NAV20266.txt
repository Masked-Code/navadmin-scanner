RMKS/1. THIS MESSAGE UPDATES THE U.S. NAVY COVID-19 STANDARDIZED 
OPERATIONAL GUIDANCE VERSION 2.1 ISSUED IN REF (A). REF (A) IS 
CANCELLED. THIS UPDATE INCORPORATES FLEET LESSONS FROM OPERATING 
IN A COVID-19 ENVIRONMENT,  HIGHLIGHTS PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY 
IN SECTION 1.C, ADDS EXPECTATION OF TESTING AND ROM-SEQUESTER 
COMPLIANCE FOR DEPLOYING UNITS AND DSCA READY FORCES IN PARA 3.C, 
DISCUSSES TESTING AT SEA IN PARA 8, ADDS GUIDANCE ON OUTBREAK 
INVESTIGATION AND CONTACT TRACING IN PARA 10, AND CLARIFIES EXPECTATIONS 
FOR EXECUTION OF ROM-SEQUESTER AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON ?FIGHTING 
THROUGH? AN OUTBREAK IN SUPPORT OF EXECUTION OF CRITICAL MISSIONS. 
NCC, FLEET, TYCOM, AND OPERATIONAL COMMANDERS MAY ISSUE TAILORED 
GUIDANCE TO UNITS WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY. 
 
1.A. TO INCREASE PROBABILITY OF A COVID-FREE MISSION READY CREW, 
UNITS WILL ADHERE TO THE FOLLOWING STANDARDIZED OPERATIONAL GUIDANCE. 
THESE DATA DRIVEN RISK MITIGATION MEASURES PROVIDE COMMANDERS THE 
TOOLS TO PREVENT, AND WHEN NECESSARY CONTAIN, COVID-19 IMPACT TO FORCE, 
MISSION AND MISSION ASSURANCE TO SAFELY AND CONFIDENTLY REMAIN ON MISSION. 
THIS GUIDANCE BUILDS ON REFS (B) AND (C) WHILE INCORPORATING GUIDANCE 
FROM REFS (D) THROUGH (J). IT WILL GUIDE INDIVIDUAL AND UNIT HEALTH 
PROTECTION, PRESERVE OPERATIONAL READINESS, AND PROTECT SHIPMATES, 
INSTALLATIONS, AND COMMUNITIES FROM COVID-19 TRANSMISSION. ALTHOUGH 
BIASED TOWARD THE SHIPBOARD ENVIRONMENT, THIS GUIDANCE APPLIES TO ALL 
PERSONNEL AND UNITS DEPLOYING TO AND FROM HOMEPORT (ORIGINATING UNIT 
LOCATION FOR RESERVE PERSONNEL) AS WELL AS ALL SHORE-BASED COMMANDS. 
IT DOES NOT APPLY TO ROUTINE TRAVEL (E.G. PCS, TDY, TAD) UNLESS THE 
TRAVELER IS A DEPLOYING INDIVIDUAL OR IS ASSIGNED TO OR WILL BE WORKING 
ABOARD AN OPERATIONAL UNIT. 
 
1.B. ADHERENCE TO THIS GUIDANCE INCLUDES ACCOUNTING FOR SPECIFIC 
CIRCUMSTANCESINVOLVING CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS PER PARAGRAPH 10. 
 
1.C. COMMANDERS. THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR COMMAND ENGAGEMENT TO 
SUCCESSFULLY PREVENT AND MITIGATE COVID-19 WITHIN YOUR UNIT. YOU SET 
THE TONE AND MUST CONVEY THE IMPORTANCE OF EACH SAILOR?S ACTIONS AND 
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO FOLLOW PUBLISHED HEALTH PROTECTION PROCEDURES 
BOTH ON AND OFF DUTY, PROPERLYEXECUTE ROM-SEQUESTER IF REQUIRED, AND 
HOLD THEMSELVES AND THEIR SHIPMATES ACCOUNTABLE FOR PERSONNEL AND MISSION 
READINESS. COMMAND ENGAGEMENT, CREW OWNERSHIP, INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTABILITY 
AND DISCIPLINED COMPLIANCE WITH EFFECTIVE HEALTH PROTECTION MEASURES SUCH 
AS CLOTH FACE COVERING USE, SOCIAL DISTANCING, SELF-MONITORING FOR ILLNESS 
AND AGGRESSIVE SPACE CLEANING ARE THE GREATEST INFLUENCERS TO PREVENTING 
COVID-19 OUTBREAKS. SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS AND DISCUSSION POINTS FOR 
YOUR LEADERSHIP TEAMS FOLLOW: 
 
1.C.1. WE HAVE DEPLOYED MISSION READY CARRIER STRIKE GROUPS, DSCA READY 
FORCES, STRATEGIC ASSETS AND INDEPENDENT UNITS WITHIN THE COVID-19 
ENVIRONMENT. THE KEY ENABLER IS A DETAILED ROM-SEQUESTER PLAN EXECUTED 
WITH RIGOROUS DISCIPLINE, COMPLIANCE, AND LEADERSHIP OVERSIGHT. THE GOLD 
STANDARD OF SINGLE OCCUPANCY BARRACKS OR HOTEL ROOMS IS NOT ALWAYS 
ACHIEVABLE. WHEN A CREW IS REQUIRED TO ROM-SEQUESTER AT HOME, A DETAILED 
SUPPORT PLAN TO ELIMINATE THE NEED TO INTERACT WITH THE PUBLIC IS 
ESSENTIAL. ROM-SEQUESTER IN HOMES OR MULTIPLE OCCUPANCY BARRACKS HAS 
BEEN SUCCESSFUL, BUT ONLY WITH STRICT COMPLIANCE TO DETAILED HEALTH 
PROTECTION MITIGATION MEASURES. 
 
1.C.2. TESTING CAN SUPPORT ROM-SEQUESTER RISK DECISIONS BUT TESTING 
RESOURCES ARE CONSTANTLY STRAINED AND MAY BECOME MORE STRAINED DURING 
INFLUENZA SEASON. DEVELOP A DETAILED PLAN EARLY AND COMMUNICATE CLEARLY 
AND REGULARLY UP ECHELON TO COORDINATE YOUR PLAN AND ENSURE YOU RECEIVE 
PROPER TESTING SUPPORT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. PLAN FOR DELAYED TEST 
RESULTS. DO NOT SECURE ROM-SEQUESTER IF TEST RESULTS ARE DELAYED. 
LEAVING ROM-SEQUESTER WITHOUT WAITING FOR DELAYED RESULTS IS A THREAT 
VECTOR DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED TO COVID OUTBREAKS. BE READY TO DEVELOP 
AND EXECUTE A NEW PLAN. 
 
1.C.3. TO DATE MORE THAN 190 SHIPS HAVE HAD AT LEAST ONE CASE ONBOARD. 
IN THE MAJORITY OF THOSE CASES, AGGRESSIVE EARLY ACTION TO ISOLATE, 
QUARANTINE, CONTACT TRACE, AND CONTINUE STRICT HEALTH PROTECTION 
MITIGATION MEASURES HAS CONTAINED THE INCIDENCE RATE ONBOARD TO WELL 
LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT, ALLOWING THOSE SHIPS TO ?FIGHT THROUGH? AND 
REMAIN ON MISSION. THE KEY ENABLERS ARE STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH PERSONAL 
PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE), AGGRESSIVE SANITIZATION/CLEANING, 
MINIMIZING CREW INTERACTIONS THROUGH SOCIAL DISTANCING, AND REDUCING 
USE OF CONFINED SPACES (E.G., GYMS, SMOKE PITS). 
 
1.C.4. SAILOR RATES OF INFECTION ARE GENERALLY THE SAME AS THE RATES 
OF INFECTION IN THE LOCAL AREA. ROM-SEQUESTER CONOPS, LEAVE AND ALL 
TDY TRAVEL APPROVALS MUST ACCOUNT FOR LOCAL COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION 
RATES. 
 
1.C.5. WITHIN THE UNIFORMED NAVY POPULATION, ROUGHLY 35 PERCENT OF 
INFECTED SAILORS EXHIBIT FEW TO NO SYMPTOMS. THIS SHOULD BUILD 
CONFIDENCE IN THE SHIP?S ABILITY TO ?FIGHT THROUGH? OUTBREAKS, BUT 
IT SHOULD ALSO STRESS THE NEED FOR STRICT ADHERENCE TO ROM-SEQUESTER 
PLANS AND TESTING. TESTING IS THE BEST WAY TO UNCOVER ASYMPTOMATIC 
SERVICE MEMBERS. 
 
1.C.6. ASSUME COVID-19 IS ONBOARD. THIS SHOULD BE THE NUMBER ONE 
PLANNING FACTOR! AVOID FALSE CONFIDENCE, COMPLACENCY, AND COVID 
?FATIGUE? WHICH CAN RESULT FROM ROM-SEQUESTER AND OVER CONFIDENCE 
IN NEGATIVE COVID-19 TESTING. EVEN AFTER THE RIGOROUS EXECUTION 
OF A 14-DAY ROM-SEQUESTER, CONTINUED EXECUTION OF FULL HEALTH PROTECTION 
MITIGATION MEASURES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE 
ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIERS DO NOT LEAD TO UNCONTROLLABLE OUTBREAKS. THIS INCLUDES 
CLOTH FACIAL COVERING USE, MANAGING THE CREW IN COHORTS, MINIMIZING THE 
TIME SPENT WITHIN 6 FEET OF OTHERS, MAXIMIZING DISTANCING WHENEVER AND 
WHEREVER POSSIBLE, AND AVOIDING UNNECESSARY CLOSE CONTACT WITH OTHERS. 
 
1.C.7. MAXIMIZE SEPARATION BETWEEN CARETAKER CREW (DUTY CREW DURING 
ROM-SEQUESTER PERIOD) AND OFF-SHIP ROM-SEQUESTER CREW TO PROTECT BOTH 
GROUPS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED CASES WHERE SHIFTING TO ROM-SEQUESTER ONBOARD 
PRIOR TO RECEIVING THE 14-DAY PERIOD ROM TEST RESULTS CONTRIBUTED TO 
OUTBREAKS THAT IMPACTED PLANNED OPERATIONS. CONVERSELY, WHEN THE CREW 
REMAINED SEQUESTERED FOR THE FULL 14 DAYS AND WERE NOT MIXED TOGETHER 
UNTIL NEGATIVE TEST RESULTS WERE CONFIRMED, WE HAVE ACHIEVED 100 PERCENT 
SUCCESS IN DEPLOYING COVID-19 FREE. 
 
1.C.8. BERTHING. SAILORS SHOULD ALTERNATE HEAD/FOOT WHERE BERTHING 
CONFIGURATION ALLOWS TO MINIMIZE CLOSE CONTACT. WHERE POSSIBLE, SPREAD 
OUT SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS. IN CONGESTED BERTHINGS, ENSURE SAILORS USE 
PERSONAL PILLOWS AND LINENS ARE REGULARLY LAUNDERED. 
 
1.C.9. COMMANDERS MUST UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT HPCON LEVEL. THREE UNITS 
WERE ABLE TO TRACE AN OUTBREAK THAT IMPACTED SHIP?S OPERATIONS TO 
COMMAND DINNERS AT A PUBLIC RESTAURANT. AS THE COUNTRY CONTINUES TO 
RE-OPEN, INDIVIDUAL SAILORS AND COMMANDS MUST SHOW RESOLVE IN PRACTICING 
PROPER HEALTH PROTECTION MEASURES AND AVOID UNNECESSARY RISK. ADDITIONALLY, 
LIBERTY AND ALL TDY TRAVEL APPROVAL PRIOR TO ROM-SEQUESTER MUST BE WEIGHED 
AGAINST RISK OF CONTRACTING COVID. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IF COVID-FREE 
WITH A PORT CALL BETWEEN AT-SEA PERIODS. 
 
1.C.10. FACE COVERINGS WITH AN EXHAUST VALVE AND NECK GAITER STYLE 
FACE COVERINGS ARE PROHIBITED AT DHA FACILITIES AND ALL FACILITIES 
IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION AND ARE SIMILARLY PROHIBITED WHERE 
DON/DOD GUIDANCE REQUIRES CLOTH FACE COVERINGS. THESE TYPE OF FACE 
COVERINGS DO NOT ENTRAIN MOISTURE IN EXHALED BREATH, FAILING TO REDUCE 
THE SPREAD OF THE COVID-19 VIRUS AND FAILING TO PROTECT OTHER PERSONNEL.

2. DEFINITIONS. 
 
2.A. COVID-19 CASE: A MEMBER DESIGNATED BY A MEDICAL PROVIDER BY ONE OF 
TWO METHODS: 1) A POSITIVE COVID-19 LABORATORY TEST (CONFIRMED CASE), 
OR 2) ASSESSED AS PRESUMED POSITIVE PER THE COUNCIL OF STATE AND 
TERRITORIAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST (CSTE) CRITERIA FOR A PROBABLE CASE. 
 
2.B. PATIENT (OR PERSON) UNDER INVESTIGATION (PUI): AN INDIVIDUAL WITH 
SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 WHO HAS A TEST RESULT PENDING OR WOULD 
HAVE BEEN TESTED HAD A TEST BEEN AVAILABLE. ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS 
QUARANTINED DUE TO CLOSE CONTACT WITH A COVID-19 POSITIVE MEMBER ARE 
NOT CLASSIFIED AS PUIS. ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS BEING TESTED FOR COVID-19 
ARE NOT CONSIDERED PUIS WHILE AWAITING TEST RESULTS. 
 
2.B.1. PUIS WHO RECEIVE A POSITIVE COVID-19 LAB TEST RESULT ARE CONSIDERED 
A CONFIRMED COVID-19 CASE AND APPROPRIATE REPORTING SHOULD TAKE PLACE. 
 
2.B.2. MEMBERS ARE NO LONGER CONSIDERED PUIS WHEN THEY RECEIVE A NEGATIVE 
COVID-19 LAB TEST RESULT OR HAVE MET ALL CRITERIA FOR RETURN TO WORK 
OUTLINED IN PARAGRAPH 7.D. 
 
2.C. HIGH-RISK PERSONNEL: THOSE INDIVIDUALS, DESIGNATED BY A MEDICAL 
PROVIDER, THAT MEET THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) 
CRITERIA FOR INCREASED RISK OF SEVERE ILLNESS FROM COVID-19 AVAILABLE AT: 
HTTPS://WWW.CDC.GOV/CORONAVIRUS/2019-NCOV/NEED-EXTRA-PRECAUTIONS/PEOPLE-AT 
-HIGHER-RISK.HTML. 
THIS LIST EVOLVES AS KNOWLEDGE OF COVID-19 GROWS AND SHOULD BE CHECKED 
FREQUENTLY. 
 
2.C.1. OPERATIONALLY AT-RISK PERSONNEL: THOSE INDIVIDUALS, DESIGNATED BY 
OPERATIONAL COMMANDERS, WHOSE DUTIES PLACE THEM AT A HIGHER RISK OF 
EXPOSURE TO THE VIRUS, THEREBY INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF INTRODUCING 
COVID-19 INTO A BUBBLE. EXPOSURE CAN OCCUR WHEN PARTICIPATING IN 
OPERATIONS, ACTIVITIES, AND PORT CALLS IN COUNTRIES WITH ACTIVE COVID-19 
CASES, ENGAGING WITH PERSONNEL FROM COUNTRIES WITH ACTIVE COVID-19 CASES, 
AND OPERATIONS THAT MAY RESULT IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND PERSON-TO-PERSON 
TRANSMISSION, SUCH AS REPLENISHMENT AT SEA AND FOOD SERVICE. 
 
2.D. CLOSE CONTACT: INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED AS BEING WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 
6 FEET (2 METERS) OF A COVID-19 CASE FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME 
(>15 MINUTES). CLOSE CONTACT CAN OCCUR WHILE CARING FOR, LIVING WITH, 
VISITING, WORKING WITH, OR SHARING A DENSELY POPULATED SPACE WITH A 
COVID-19 CASE. CLOSE CONTACT CAN ALSO BE ESTABLISHED VIA DIRECT CONTACT 
(E.G. BEING COUGHED OR SNEEZED UPON BY A COVID-19 CASE). DETERMINATION 
OF CLOSE CONTACT PRESUMES THE INTERACTION TRANSPIRED DURING THE POTENTIALLY 
INFECTIOUS PERIOD OF THE COVID-19 CASE, DEFINED AS 48 HOURS PRIOR TO 
SYMPTOM ONSET, OR FIRST POSITIVE TEST IF ASYMPTOMATIC, TO THE TIME THE 
COVID-19 CASE IS PLACED IN ISOLATION. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, AN 
INDIVIDUAL IS CONSIDERED A CLOSE CONTACT EVEN IF THEY WERE WEARING A 
CLOTH FACE COVERING. SOME EXAMPLES SPECIFIC TO THE SHIPBOARD ENVIRONMENT 
INCLUDE: A) INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE COVID-19 CASE?S BERTHING AREA ASSIGNED 
AN ADJACENT RACK INCLUDING DIRECTLY ACROSS A NARROW AISLE; B) PROLONGED 
INTERACTION WITHIN RELATIVELY CONFINED SPACES INTERNAL TO THE SHIP 
(E.G. WORK SPACE, GALLEY, GYM, SMOKING DECK, CHAPEL, ETC.). 
 
2.E. MEDICAL SCREENING: COVID-19 MEDICAL SCREENING SHOULD INCLUDE 
EVALUATION FOR THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS: FEVER OR CHILLS, COUGH, SHORTNESS 
OF BREATH OR DIFFICULTY BREATHING, FATIGUE, MUSCLE OR BODY ACHES, HEADACHE, 
NEW LOSS OF TASTE OR SMELL, SORE THROAT, CONGESTION OR RUNNY NOSE, NAUSEA 
OR VOMITING, AND DIARRHEA. A COMPLETE LIST OF COVID-19 SYMPTOMS CAN BE FOUND 
AT: HTTPS://WWW.CDC.GOV/CORONAVIRUS/2019-NCOV/SYMPTOMS-TESTING/SYMPTOMS.HTML. 
THE FLU VACCINE CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH MILD SIDE EFFECTS SUCH AS SORENESS, 
REDNESS OR SWELLING AT THE INJECTION SITE, LOW GRADE FEVER AND BODY ACHES. 
THESE SYMPTOMS COULD BE CONFUSED WITH COVID LIKE SYMPTOMS SO HISTORY OF 
FLU SHOT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN EVALUATING COVID LIKE SYMPTOMS. 
 
2.F. SELF-MONITORING: PER THE CDC, SELF-MONITORING INCLUDES ASSESSING FOR 
COVID-19 SYMPTOMS PER PARAGRAPH 2.E. INDIVIDUALS THAT DEVELOP COVID-19 
SYMPTOMS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY SELF-ISOLATE, AVOID CONTACT WITH OTHERS, AND 
SEEK ADVICE FROM A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER TO DETERMINE IF FURTHER MEDICAL 
EVALUATION IS REQUIRED. 
 
2.G. RESTRICTION OF MOVEMENT (ROM). GENERAL DOD TERM FOR LIMITING PERSONAL 
INTERACTION TO REDUCE RISK TO THE HEALTH, SAFETY AND WELFARE OF A BROADER 
COHORT. ROM IS USED TO MINIMIZE RISK OF INDIVIDUALS ENCOUNTERING COVID-19 
CONTAGIOUS INDIVIDUALS, AND TO PREVENT PERSONNEL WHO HAVE BEEN IN A HIGHER 
RISK AREA FROM POTENTIALLY INFECTING OTHERS. ROM INCLUDES ISOLATION, 
QUARANTINE AND ROM-SEQUESTER. 
 
2.G.1. ISOLATION: MEDICAL TERM FOR THE STRICT SEPARATION OF PERSONNEL FROM 
OTHERS DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF POTENTIAL OR PROVEN COVID-19 SYMPTOMS OR 
A POSITIVE COVID-19 TEST. 
 
2.G.2. QUARANTINE: MEDICAL TERM FOR SEPARATING ASYMPTOMATIC PERSONNEL FROM 
THOSE PEOPLE REASONABLY BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO A COMMUNICABLE 
DISEASE, TO PREVENT THE POSSIBLE SPREAD OF THE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE. FOR 
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, PERSONNEL WITH NO COVID-19 SYMPTOMS WHO HAVE RECENTLY 
RETURNED FROM A HIGHER RISK LOCATION OR HAD CLOSE CONTACT WITH A KNOWN 
COVID-19 POSITIVE PATIENT SHOULD BE QUARANTINED. THE QUARANTINE PERIOD IS 
14-DAYS. PERSONNEL WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID-19 DO NOT NEED TO 
QUARANTINE OR GET TESTED AGAIN FOR UP TO 3 MONTHS AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT 
DEVELOP SYMPTOMS AGAIN. THIS EXCEPTION IS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF DEAD VIRAL 
FRAGMENTS THAT ARE NO LONGER CONTAGIOUS BUT WILL LIKELY YIELD A POSITIVE 
TEST RESULT. 
 
2.G.3. ROM-SEQUESTER: U.S. NAVY TERM FOR PREEMPTIVE SEPARATION OF FORCES 
TO REDUCE RISK OF INFECTION WHILE ATTEMPTING TO ESTABLISH A COVID-FREE 
BUBBLE. ROM-SEQUESTER CAN BE CONDUCTED ONBOARD SHIP, IN CONTRACTED 
FACILITIES, OR IN PERSONAL RESIDENCE DEPENDENT ON UNIT-SPECIFIC SCENARIOS. 
DURING ROM-SEQUESTER, INTERACTION WITH INDIVIDUALS MUST BE MINIMIZED, 
BY NECESSITY ONLY WITH ALL HEALTH PROTECTION MEASURES IMPLEMENTED. ASSUME 
EVERYONE HAS COVID. INTERACTION WITHIN ROM-SEQUESTER LOCATION IS RESTRICTED 
TO NECESSITIES SUCH AS FOOD DELIVERY, HEALTH AND WELFARE CHECKS, ETC. 
 
2.H. BUBBLE: TERM FOR INDIVIDUALS, UNITS OR INSTALLATIONS THAT HAVE 
ESTABLISHED LOW PROBABILITY OF COVID-19 INFECTION. A CREW THAT HAS BEEN 
UNDERWAY, OR ROM-SEQUESTERED, FOR GREATER THAN 14 DAYS WITHOUT COVID-19 
POSITIVE PERSONNEL AND NO COVID-19 SYMPTOMS IS CONSIDERED TO BE WITHIN 
A BUBBLE. 
 
2.I. BUBBLE TO BUBBLE TRANSFER (B2BT): TERM FOR MOVEMENT OF UNITS OR 
PERSONNEL FROM ONE BUBBLE TO ANOTHER VIA CONTROLLED MEANS. A WIDE VARIETY 
OF MODES OR MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION CAN BE USED FOR B2BT. THE KEY FACTOR 
IS THAT THE EVOLUTION IS CLOSELY CONTROLLED TO MINIMIZE RISK OF COVID-19 
EXPOSURE TO BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND UNITS WHO HAVE NOT COMPLETED A ROM-SEQUESTER 
DURING TRANSFER. 
 
2.J. TESTING: GENERAL TERM FOR THE INTENDED USE OF REAGENTS, SUPPLIES, 
AND EQUIPMENT TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF SARS-COV-2, THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES 
COVID-19, IN SAMPLES COLLECTED FROM INDIVIDUALS. 
 
2.J.1. DIAGNOSTIC TESTING: USE OF AN APPROVED TEST BY CERTIFIED 
LABORATORIES, TO INCLUDE SHIPBOARD CERTIFIED LABS, TO DIAGNOSE COVID-19 
INFECTION IN AN INDIVIDUAL SUSPECTED OF BEING INFECTED. INDIVIDUALS 
SUSPECTED OF BEING INFECTED INCLUDE SYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS WHO PRESENT 
TO A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER, AND INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED THROUGH CONTACT TRACING. 
 
2.J.2. SCREENING TESTING: TESTING OF A POPULATION TO ENSURE THE ENTIRE 
POPULATION OR AN AT RISK SUB-POPULATION IS CLEAR OF INFECTION. TYPICALLY 
DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A RESTRICTION OF MOVEMENT TO ENSURE THE POPULATION 
DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME INFECTED OR THE INFECTION HAD RUN ITS 
COURSE PRIOR TO BRINGING A GROUP TOGETHER. MAY ALSO BE USED TO TEST CRITICAL 
WATCHSTANDERS UNDERWAY WEN AN INFECTION IS SUSPECTED OR IDENTIFIED. 
 
2.J.3. SURVEILLANCE TESTING: TESTING OF RANDOM PORTIONS OF A POPULATION TO 
SEARCH FOR AND IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SPREAD OF ASYMPTOMATIC COVID-19 INFECTIONS. 
 
2.K. INFLUENZA LIKE ILLNESS (ILI): PER CDC, ILI IS DEFINED AS FEVER 
(TEMPERATURE OF 100.4 DEGREES F [37.8 DEGREES C] OR GREATER) AND A COUGH 
AND/OR A SORE THROAT WITHOUT A KNOWN CAUSE. 
 
3. MINIMUM ACTION REQUIRED PRIOR TO DEPLOYED/DSCA READY FORCE OPERATIONS. 
 
3.A. MANDATORY MEDICAL SCREENING BY A MEDICAL PROVIDER. 
 
3.A.1. PRE-DEPLOYMENT SCREENING FOR ALL PERSONNEL WILL CONSIST OF AN 
ASSESSMENT OF COVID-19 EXPOSURE HISTORY, A TEMPERATURE CHECK, A CHECK FOR 
COVID-19 SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS LISTED IN PARA 2.E. FOR MILITARY MEMBERS, IT 
WILL ALSO INCLUDE A REVIEW OF ANY PAST COVID-19 TESTING AND A THOROUGH 
EVALUATION OF THE MEMBER?S RISK FACTORS FOR SEVERE ILLNESS FROM COVID-19. 
 
3.A.2. DEPLOYMENT OF HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE UNCOMMON AND GUIDED 
BY MEDICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOUND IN REF (H). THE DECISION TO DEPLOY THE 
INDIVIDUAL MUST BE MADE, AT A MINIMUM, BY THE ISIC. MILITARY SEALIFT 
COMMAND (MSC) WILL MEDICALLY SCREEN CIVIL SERVICE AND CONTRACT PERSONNEL 
FOR DEPLOYMENT ON MSC VESSELS IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING MSC INSTRUCTIONS 
AND CONTRACTS. 
 
3.B. CONDUCT A MINIMUM 14-DAY ROM-SEQUESTER PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT. DEPENDING 
ON SCHEDULED AND PLANNED OPERATIONS, THE NCC WILL DETERMINE IF ROM-SEQUESTER 
IS REQUIRED PRIOR TO INTEGRATED PHASE. 
 
3.B.1. CONDUCT ENHANCED DAILY PERSONNEL MEDICAL SCREENING (QUESTIONNAIRE AND 
TEMPERATURE CHECKS). 
 
3.B.2. ALL PERSONNEL DEPLOYING OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WILL UNDERGO A 14-
DAY ROM-SEQUESTER PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT UNLESS COMBATANT COMMAND MANDATES IN-
COUNTRY ROM. IF TRAVELING OCONUS AND THE HOST NATION REQUIRES 14-DAY IN-
COUNTRY ROM, CONUS PRE-DEPLOYMENT ROM-SEQUESTER IS NOT REQUIRED UNLESS THE 
HOST NATION OR COMBATANT COMMAND EXPLICITLY MANDATES BOTH. CONSULT FOREIGN 
CLEARANCE GUIDANCE FOR MOST CURRENT REQUIREMENTS, AVAILABLE AT 
HTTPS://WWW.FCG.PENTAGON.MIL. 
 
3.B.3. ACCEPTABLE ROM-SEQUESTER FACILITIES ARE: SHIP BERTHING, LIVING BARGE, 
INDIVIDUAL BARRACKS/HOTEL ROOMS, OR PERSONAL RESIDENCE (LIMITED CONTACT WITH 
OTHER RESIDENTS). EACH HAS PROS AND CONS THAT MUST BE WEIGHED AGAINST 
UNIT-SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES AND RISK. MINIMIZING CONTACT WITH OTHERS AND 
FOLLOWING HEALTH PROTECTION MITIGATION MEASURES IS CRITICAL TO SUCCESSFUL 
ROM-SEQUESTER. 
 
3.B.4. PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING AND SANITIZE MORE FREQUENTLY WHILE MANNING 
ESSENTIAL WATCH STATIONS, COMPLETING REQUIRED MAINTENANCE, AND CONDUCTING 
REQUIRED UNDERWAY PREPARATION (LOGISTICS, TRAINING, ETC.). 
 
3.B.5. DEVELOP OPERATIONAL BENCH FOR REDLINE PERSONNEL TO MAINTAIN MISSION 
ESSENTIAL OPERATIONS (NUCLEAR POWER PLANT, BRIDGE, COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER, 
CWC WATCHES, MEDICAL PROVIDERS, ETC. 
 
3.C. ROM-SEQUESTER PER FLEET APPROVED COMMUNITY CONOPS. ALL ROM-SEQUESTERS 
WILL BE A MINIMUM OF 14 DAYS IN LENGTH, AND REQUIRE TWO TESTS. FIRST TEST 
SHALL BE A TEST-IN WITH A NEGATIVE COVID TEST RESULT PRIOR TO THE CREW 
INITIATING THE ROM-SEQUESTER. 
 
3.C.1. ROM-SEQUESTER CONDUCTED ASHORE: REQUIRES ISOLATION PER CDC GUIDANCE 
(I.E., SEPARATE ROOM, NO SHARED BATHROOM). SECOND TEST SHALL BE CONDUCTED 
ON OR AFTER DAY 14.  A NEGATIVE COVID TEST RESULT IS REQUIRED TO EMBARK. 
 
3.C.2. ROM-SEQUESTERS CONDUCTED ONBOARD A VESSEL OR IN A GROUP SETTING ASHORE 
(I.E., NOT ISOLATED PER CDC GUIDANCE): THE NCC WILL DIRECT EXACT TIMING OF 
THE SECOND TEST, BUT THE SECOND TEST SHALL BE NO EARLIER THAN DAY SEVEN. 
SERVICE MEMBERS TESTING POSITIVE WILL BE IMMEDIATELY ISOLATED TO MITIGATE 
COVID-19 VIRUS SPREAD. 
 
3.C.3. THE NCC MAY APPROVE DEVIATIONS TO ROM-SEQUESTER PLANS DUE TO EMERGENT 
TASKING OR TESTING LIMITS. THE NCC CAN ALSO ELECT TO BE MORE RESTRICTIVE IN 
THEIR TESTING PROTOCOLS PROVIDED TESTING CAPACITY SUPPORTS. 
 
3.C.4. TESTING IS THE BEST WAY TO IDENTIFY ASYMPTOMATIC COVID-19 POSITIVE 
INDIVIDUALS. HOWEVER, TESTING DOES NOT GUARANTEE A COVID-FREE UNIT DUE TO 
THE POTENTIAL FOR FALSE NEGATIVE TESTS. COMMANDERS SHALL ASSUME COVID IS 
ON THEIR SHIPS AND SUBMARINES AND ENSURE STRICT COMPLIANCE TO HEALTH 
PROTECTION MEASURES UNTIL SUFFICIENT COVID-FREE UNDERWAY TIME HAS ELAPSED AND 
BUBBLE INTEGRITY HAS BEEN MAINTAINED. 
 
3.C.5. USE OPERATIONAL UNIT RETURN TO WORK (RTW) GUIDANCE, PARA. 7.D.1 TO 
CLEAR COVID POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS. 
 
3.D. SHIP RIDERS (E.G. CONTRACTORS, TECH REPS, INSPECTION TEAMS, ETC.), 
DIRECT SUPPORT PERSONNEL, AND ALL OTHERS ASSISTING COMMANDS PRIOR TO BUBBLE 
ESTABLISHMENT WILL ADHERE TO LOCAL FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS 
(DAILY COVID-19 SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE, TEMPERATURE CHECKS, SOCIAL 
DISTANCING, PPE USAGE, RESTRICTED SHIPBOARD MOVEMENT, SANITIZATION, ETC.). 
WHEN INVOLVED IN MOVEMENT TO SEQUENTIAL COMMANDS, IT MAY BE ADVISABLE TO ROM-
SEQUESTER COHORTS, USE B2BT, AND/OR TEST PERIODICALLY. 
 
3.E. SHIP RIDERS (E.G. CONTRACTORS, TECH REPS, INSPECTION TEAMS, ETC.), 
DIRECT SUPPORT PERSONNEL, AND ALL OTHERS PENETRATING AN ESTABLISHED BUBBLE 
WILL COMPLETE A 14-DAY ROM-SEQUESTER WITH A NEGATIVE TEST PRIOR TO EMBARKING. 
A NEGATIVE TEST POST ROM IS NOT REQUIRED FOR PERSONNEL WHO RECOVERED FROM 
COVID-19 WITHIN THE PAST 90 DAYS (DUE TO PERSISTENT POSITIVE RESULTS). 
USE OPERATIONAL UNIT RTW GUIDANCE TO CLEAR COVID POSITIVE PERSONNEL, 
PARA. 7.D.1. MITIGATION PLANS TO PENETRATE AN ESTABLISHED BUBBLE WITHOUT A 
14 DAY ROM-SEQUESTER AND/OR TEST DUE TO EMERGENT OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
MUST BE APPROVED BY THE NCC OR NCC-DESIGNATED APPROVAL AUTHORITIES. 
 
4. MINIMUM REQUIRED ACTION FOR MAINTENANCE, BASIC, ADVANCED/INTEGRATED, AND 
SUSTAINMENT PHASES. 
 
4.A. MAINTENANCE PHASE. AGGRESSIVE AWARENESS, SELF-MONITORING, TIMELY 
DIAGNOSIS, AND THOROUGH CONTACT TRACING ARE ALL CRITICAL TO COMBATTING 
COVID-19. FAILURE TO CONNECT THE DOTS ON SYMPTOMATIC SAILORS MAY LEAD TO 
UNCONTROLLABLE OUTBREAKS. COMMANDERS MUST REMAIN ALERT TO SIGNS OF COVID 
SPREAD BY ASYMPTOMATIC SAILORS. SIGNS MAY BE SAILORS FROM DIFFERENT 
DEPARTMENTS WITHOUT KNOWN COVID POSITIVE SAILORS SUDDENLY EXHIBITING 
SYMPTOMS. THE FOLLOWING MINIMUM MEASURES APPLY: 
 
4.A.1. COMPLY WITH LOCAL HPCON REQUIREMENTS, HEALTH PROTECTION MEASURES AND 
BE AWARE OF LOCAL COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION RATES. EMPHASIZE PERSONAL 
RESPONSIBILITY (FREQUENT HAND WASHING, CLOTH FACE COVERINGS, SOCIAL 
DISTANCING, AVOIDING LOCAL AREAS WITH HIGH POPULATION DENSITY, SELF-MONITOR, 
ETC.) EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A KNOWN OUTBREAK OR IN AN ESTABLISHED BUBBLE. 
REPORT AND ISOLATE PERSONNEL WITH COVID-19 SYMPTOMS. SCREEN ALL INDIVIDUALS 
DAILY PRIOR TO ENTERING THE WORK CENTER IN ACCORDANCE WITH CDC GUIDANCE, 
AVAILABLE AT HTTPS://WWW.CDC.GOV/SCREENING/INDEX.HTML. CLEAN AND DISINFECT 
SPACES DAILY IAW NAVSEA CLEANING GUIDANCE. CONSIDER ADDITIONAL COVID-19 
OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT (ORM) MEASURES FOR MAJOR EVENTS 
(E.G. SHIPBOARD DRILLS). 
 
4.A.2. SUPPORT ORGANIZATION COMMANDERS (E.G. SHIPYARD PERSONNEL, CONTRACT 
SUPPORT, TRAINING TEAMS) CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS THE CURRENT HPCON, CDC 
THREAT LEVEL, METHOD/MODE OF TRAVEL, ETC. WHEN ASSESSING RISK AND DETERMINING 
WHETHER ROM-SEQUESTER IS WARRANTED. FOR EXAMPLE, A TEAM OF SHIPYARD WORKERS 
MOVING FROM AN AREA WITH LOW COVID CASES TO AN AREA OF LOW, MEDIUM OR HIGH 
COVID CASES MIGHT NOT WARRANT ROM-SEQUESTER UNLESS COMPELLED BY OTHER 
CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS TRAVEL THROUGH A HIGH RISK AIRPORT. REGARDLESS, 
VISITORS SHOULD FOLLOW THE SAME DAILY SCREENING PROCEDURES, SELF-MONITORING, 
TEMPERATURE CHECKS, SOCIAL DISTANCING, PPE USAGE, AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY 
PROTOCOLS AS SHIP?S FORCE. 
 
4.A.3. AIRCRAFT SQUADRON COMMANDERS SHOULD CONSIDER THE CURRENT RISK LEVEL 
PER PARAGRAPH 4.A.2 TO DETERMINE IF ROM-SEQUESTER IS REQUIRED FOR TRAINING 
DETACHMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, A SAILOR MAY USE A PERSONAL VEHICLE TO DRIVE FROM 
MILITARY BASE TO MILITARY BASE WITH INFREQUENT GAS OR FOOD STOPS TO MAINTAIN 
A MODIFIED BUBBLE. REGARDLESS, TRAVELERS SHOULD FOLLOW THE SAME DAILY 
SCREENING PROCEDURES, SELF-MONITORING, TEMPERATURE CHECKS, SOCIAL 
DISTANCING, PPE, AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY PROTOCOLS DICTATED BY LOCAL 
HPCON CONDITIONS. 
 
4.B. BASIC AND ADVANCED PHASES. INCLUDES SAME MEASURES AS THE MAINTENANCE 
PHASE, PLUS: 
 
4.B.1. UNDERWAY OPERATIONS WITH MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITY (MTF) SUPPORT 
WITHIN 72 HOURS: SCREEN HIGH RISK SAILORS AND ENSURE PPE LOADOUT MEETS 
FLEET GUIDANCE. CONDUCT DAILY SCREENING PROCEDURES FOR COVID-19 SYMPTOMS. 
FOLLOW PLATFORM SPECIFIC COVID-19 CONOPS AND STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES 
(SOPS). 
 
4.B.2. UNDERWAY OPERATIONS WHEN MTF SUPPORT WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE WITHIN 
72 HOURS: SAME MEASURES AS LOCAL OPERATIONS, PLUS, IAW FLEET COMMANDER 
GUIDANCE, CONSIDER MEDICAL TEAM AUGMENT, MEDEVAC AUGMENT/HELO CAPABILITY, 
AND/OR SHIPBOARD TESTING CAPABILITY. 
 
4.C. INTEGRATED PHASE: SAME MEASURES AS MAINTENANCE AND BASIC AND ADVANCED 
PHASES, PLUS: 
 
4.C.1. IF DEPLOYING IMMEDIATELY AFTER INTEGRATED PHASE 
(E.G., COMPTUEX(C2X), ARGMEUEX) OR PRE-OVERSEAS MOVEMENT EVALUATION 
(POMEVAL), FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE IN PARAGRAPH 3. 
 
4.D. SUSTAINMENT PHASE. 
 
4.D.1. UNDERWAY: MAINTAIN BUBBLE PER PARAGRAPH 3.E. 
 
4.D.2. PIER-SIDE: FOLLOWING DEPLOYMENT, FOLLOW BASIC PHASE GUIDANCE. 
OPERATIONAL COMMANDERS MAY ELECT TO SHIFT TO PARAGRAPH 3 GUIDANCE 
DEPENDING ON LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS. 
 
4.E. FOR SHORE BASED COMMANDS SENDING PERSONNEL TO AFLOAT UNITS, FOLLOW 
THE GUIDANCE THAT APPLIES TO THE PHASE OF THE RECEIVING UNIT. FOR ALL 
PERSONNEL TRAVELING TO SHORE COMMANDS (E.G. SCHOOLS, TDY), FOLLOW 
MAINTENANCE PHASE CRITERIA OF PARA 4.A. 
 
4.F. FOR ALL PHASES, DISCIPLINED INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PUBLIC 
HEALTH PROTECTION MEASURES ARE THE BEDROCK OF RISK REDUCTION AND RISK 
MITIGATION. COVID MITIGATION PROTOCOL, WHERE APPROPRIATE, SHOULD CONSIDER 
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR HIGH RISK PERSONNEL. COMMANDERS ARE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR DEVELOPING, MANAGING, OVERSEEING AND IMPLEMENTING PROTOCOLS FOR THEIR 
UNITS. INDIVIDUALS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTING THOSE PROTOCOLS. 
 
5. DUE TO THE UNIQUE NATURE OF FORWARD DEPLOYED NAVAL FORCES (FDNF) AND 
THEIR HOST NATION RELATIONSHIP, NCCS WILL DEFINE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
FOR FDNF UNITS BASED ON PARAGRAPHS 3 AND 4. 
 
6. COMMANDERS MAY NEED TO EXEMPT AIRCREW AND AIRCRAFT MAINTAINERS FROM 
THIS GUIDANCE TO MEET EMERGENT OPERATIONAL OR NATOPS CURRENCY REQUIREMENTS. 
ROBUST RISK MITIGATION IS REQUIRED TO MINIMIZE COVID THREATS TO EXISTING 
BUBBLES. MITIGATION PLANS MUST BE APPROVED BY THE NCC. FOR AVIATION UNITS 
EMBARKED ON SURFACE UNITS, MITIGATION PLANS WILL BE INCLUDED AND APPROVED 
AS PART OF THE OVERALL SHIP MITIGATION PLAN. 
 
7. REQUIRED ACTION WHEN MILITARY, CIVILIAN, OR CONTRACTOR EXHIBITS SIGNS 
OR SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 INFECTION. 
 
7.A. ISOLATE, MEDICALLY SCREEN AND DESIGNATE AS A PUI OR PROBABLE COVID-19 
CASE. RESTRICT CONTACT AND PROTECT THE OPERATIONAL BENCH IF APPLICABLE. 
 
7.A.1. IF ISOLATED ABOARD SHIP, USE SMALL BERTHING AREAS (E.G. STATEROOMS, 
PREFERABLY WITH HEADS) FOR SEPARATION. WHEN ADEQUATE SHIPBOARD ISOLATION 
CAPACITY IS EXHAUSTED, CONSIDER TRANSFERRING PUIS TO UNITS WITH REMAINING 
CAPACITY OR ASHORE IAW FLEET COMMANDER GUIDANCE, IF FEASIBLE AND MISSION 
ALLOWS. 
 
7.A.2. IF ISOLATED ASHORE, PROVIDE NECESSARY MEDICAL TREATMENT UNTIL 
CLINICALLY IMPROVED. 
 
7.B. IDENTIFY, QUARANTINE, AND MEDICALLY SCREEN CLOSE CONTACTS OF COVID-19 
CASES. ISOLATE SYMPTOMATIC PUIS AS DEFINED IN PARAGRAPHS 2.A AND 2.B AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE. MINIMUM SCREENING SHOULD INCLUDE USE OF CDC COVID-19 
QUESTIONNAIRE, CDC FACILITIES COVID-19 SCREENING, AVAILABLE AT 
HTTPS://WWW.CDC.GOV/SCREENING/PAPER-VERSION.PDF TO ASSESS RISK. WHEN LOCAL 
TESTING CAPACITY AND SUPPLIES ALLOW, TESTING IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL CLOSE 
CONTACTS OF CONFIRMED OR PROBABLE COVID-19 PATIENTS. PEOPLE WHO HAVE TESTED 
POSITIVE FOR COVID-19 DO NOT NEED TO QUARANTINE OR GET TESTED AGAIN FOR 
3 MONTHS, BUT MUST CONTINUE SOCIAL DISTANCING AND CLOTH FACE COVERING USE. 
WHEN ADEQUATE SHIPBOARD QUARANTINE CAPACITY IS EXHAUSTED, CONSIDER 
TRANSFERRING CLOSE CONTACTS TO UNITS WITH REMAINING CAPACITY OR ASHORE, 
IF FEASIBLE AND MISSION ALLOWS. 
 
7.B.1. CLOSE CONTACTS WHO SUBSEQUENTLY TEST POSITIVE WILL BE ISOLATED AND 
TREATED UNDER COVID-19 CASE PROTOCOLS. CLOSE CONTACTS MUST REMAIN IN 
QUARANTINE FOR 14 DAYS EVEN IF THEY TEST NEGATIVE. SOME INDIVIDUALS MAY 
TEST NEGATIVE FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER EXPOSURE AND TAKE UP TO 14 DAYS TO 
EXHIBIT SYMPTOMS. 
 
7.B.2  ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS QUARANTINED DUE TO CLOSE CONTACT ARE NOT 
CONSIDERED PUI, PER PARAGRAPH 2.B. 
 
7.B.3. IF A CLOSE CONTACT BECOMES SYMPTOMATIC ? FOLLOW PUI PROTOCOL. 
 
7.C. PROTOCOL FOR PUI. 
 
7.C.1 ISOLATE ALL PUIS. TEST PUI IF POSSIBLE. 
 
7.C.2. IF TEST RESULT IS POSITIVE - CONTINUE ISOLATION AND FOLLOW 
PARAGRAPH 7.D. CONDUCT COVID-19 CONTACT TRACING PER PARAGRAPH 9.D. 
 
7.C.3 IF TEST RESULT IS NEGATIVE ? CONTINUE TO ISOLATE AND FOLLOW PARAGRAPH 
7.D. 
PROVIDE MEDICAL TREATMENT UNTIL CLINICALLY IMPROVED. IF A KNOWN COVID-19 
OUTBREAK IS OCCURRING, CONTINUE TO ISOLATE AND FOLLOW PARAGRAPH 9.D. 
 
7.C.4 IF TEST RESULT IS NEGATIVE AND PUI DOES NOT IMPROVE ? CONTINUE TO 
ISOLATE AND FOLLOW PARAGRAPH 7.D. IF A KNOWN COVID-19 OUTBREAK IS 
OCCURRING, CONDUCT COVID-19 CONTACT TRACING PER PARAGRAPH 9.D. 
 
7.C.5 IF NO TEST IS PERFORMED ? CONTINUE TO ISOLATE. MEDICALLY SCREEN 
TWICE A DAY AT A MINIMUM AND, IF SYMPTOMS WORSEN, CONSULT MEDICAL ISIC 
AND FLEET/TYCOM SURGEON REGARDING TRANSFER TO MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITY. 
AT SEA, TRANSFER ASHORE IAW FLEET COMMANDER?S GUIDANCE. FOLLOW PARAGRAPH 7.D. 
IF A KNOWN OR SUSPECTED COVID-19 OUTBREAK IS OCCURRING, CONDUCT COVID-19 
CONTACT TRACING PER PARAGRAPH 9.D. 
 
7.D. RETURN TO WORK (RTW) GUIDANCE FOR COVID-19 CASES AND PUIS. 
 
7.D.1. OPERATIONAL UNITS. COVID-19 CASES MUST MEET ALL OF THE FOLLOWING 
CRITERIA TO RTW: (1) AT LEAST 24 HOURS HAVE PASSED SINCE RESOLUTION OF 
FEVER WITHOUT THE USE OF FEVER REDUCING MEDICATION; (2) PROGRESSIVE 
IMPROVEMENT IN OTHER COVID-19 SYMPTOMS AS DETERMINED BY A MEDICAL PROVIDER; 
AND (3) AT LEAST 14 DAYS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE SYMPTOMS FIRST APPEARED 
OR SINCE THE DATE OF THE FIRST POSITIVE RT-PCR TEST IF ASYMPTOMATIC. 
 
7.D.2. ALL OTHER UNITS AND STAFFS. COVID-19 CASES AND PUIS MUST MEET ALL 
OF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA TO RTW: (1) AT LEAST 24 HOURS HAVE PASSED SINCE 
RESOLUTION OF FEVER WITHOUT THE USE OF FEVER REDUCING MEDICATION; (2) 
IMPROVEMENT IN OTHER COVID-19 SYMPTOMS; AND (3) AT LEAST 10 DAYS HAVE 
ELAPSED SINCE THE SYMPTOMS FIRST APPEARED OR RT-PCR TEST DATE IF 
ASYMPTOMATIC. 
 
7.D.3. FOR SEVERE CASES WHERE INDIVIDUALS REQUIRED HOSPITALIZATION, 
EXTEND THE DURATION OF ISOLATION SUCH THAT RTW IS NO EARLIER THAN DAY 21 
(20 DAYS SINCE SYMPTOM ONSET) AS SOME PERSONS WITH SEVERE COVID-19 
ILLNESS MAY REMAIN INFECTIOUS FOR SLIGHTLY LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. 
 
7.D.4. RETURN TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE. THE RTW GUIDANCE IN 7.D.1 THROUGH 7.D.3 
IS BASED ON RESOLUTION OF INFECTIVITY. BASED ON SEVERITY OF ILLNESS, SOME 
PERSONNEL MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TIME TO GRADUALLY RETURN TO INTENSE 
EXERCISE. 
REF (H) CONTAINS RETURN TO EXERCISE RECOMMENDATIONS. 
 
7.D.5. NCC MAY ELECT TO TREAT CRITICAL OPERATIONAL ENABLERS, SUCH AS 
INSPECTION AND CERTIFICATION TEAMS, AS OPERATIONAL UNITS PER PARA. 7.D.1. 
 
7.D.6. A TEST-BASED STRATEGY IS NO LONGER RECOMMENDED TO DETERMINE RTW 
BECAUSE IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES IT RESULTS IN IDENTIFYING THOSE WHO 
CONTINUE TO SHED DETECTABLE SARS-COV-2 RNA BUT ARE NO LONGER INFECTIOUS. 
A COMBINATION OF BOTH SYMPTOM RESOLUTION AND TESTING CRITERIA IS NOT 
RECOMMENDED AS IT WILL LIKELY EXTEND RTW WITH NO CORRESPONDING DECREASE 
OF INFECTION TRANSMISSION. 
 
7.D.7. A PATIENT WITH SUSPECTED COVID LIKE ILLNESS (CLI)/INFLUENZA LIKE 
ILLNESS (ILI) WHO HAS TESTED NEGATIVE FOR COVID-19 MAY RETURN TO WORK AFTER 
THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET: (1) AT LEAST 24 HOURS AFTER THE 
RESOLUTION OF FEVER WITHOUT THE USE OF FEVER REDUCING MEDICATION; 
(2) IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS AND (3) AT LEAST 10 DAYS SINCE THE ONSET OF 
SYMPTOMS. CENTERS OF DISEASE CONTROL DEFINES ILI AS FEVER (TEMPERATURE) OF 
100.4F [37.8C] OR GREATER AND A COUGH AND/OR SORE THROAT WITHOUT A KNOWN 
CAUSE OTHER THAN INFLUENZA. 
 
7.E. COVID-19 CASES MAY CONTINUE TO TEST POSITIVE FOR UP TO THREE MONTHS 
DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF PERSISTENT NON-INFECTIOUS VIRAL FRAGMENTS. 
THEREFORE, COVID-19 CASES ARE EXEMPT FROM ANY REQUIRED TESTING PROTOCOL 
FOR THREE MONTHS FOLLOWING ANY POSITIVE TEST. INDIVIDUALS THAT EXHIBIT 
NEW OR PERSISTENT SYMPTOMS DURING THAT THREE MONTH PERIOD SHOULD BE 
EVALUATED BY A MEDICAL PROVIDER. STUDIES HAVE NOT FOUND EVIDENCE THAT 
CLINICALLY RECOVERED PERSONS WITH PERSISTENCE OF VIRAL RNA HAVE TRANSMITTED 
COVID-19 TO OTHERS. 
 
7.E.1. RECOVERED PERSONS MUST CONTINUE TO WEAR CLOTH FACE COVERINGS AND 
SOCIAL DISTANCE INFECTION PRECAUTIONS MUST CONTINUE TO BE TAKEN AFTER 
RTW IS APPROVED. 
 
7.F. ANTIBODY TESTING AND VIRAL CULTURE. ANTIBODY TESTING OR VIRAL 
CULTURE SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A PRIMARY OR STAND-ALONE RETURN TO WORK 
CRITERION. HOWEVER, IF EITHER HAVE BEEN OBTAINED DURING A COVID CASE 
CLINICAL EVALUATION, RESULTS MAY BE USED AS SUPPLEMENTAL CRITERIA FOR 
PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING CASES OR FOR PUBLIC HEALTH OUTBREAK MANAGEMENT 
PURPOSES. 
 
7.G. COMMAND AND MEMBER NOTIFICATION. THE INDIVIDUAL SICK SLIP (DD FORM 689) 
MUST BE USED TO NOTIFY BOTH THE MEMBER AND THE CHAIN OF COMMAND OF ANY 
TEST-CONFIRMED OR PRESUMPTIVE COVID ILLNESS, WHETHER SYMPTOMATIC OR NOT. 
SECTION 11 (DISPOSITION) AND SECTION 12 (REMARKS) MUST CLEARLY INDICATE 
THE MEDICALLY-RECOMMENDED DISPOSITION, FOLLOW UP, AND QUARANTINE/ISOLATION 
REQUIREMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS GUIDANCE. THE SICK SLIP MUST ALSO BE 
USED TO NOTIFY ASYMPTOMATIC MEMBERS AND THE CHAIN OF COMMAND OF ANY PUI 
OR CLOSE CONTACT, QUARANTINE, OR ISOLATION REQUIREMENTS IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH THIS GUIDANCE. BEGINNING AND ENDING DATES OF THE QUARANTINE/ISOLATION 
PERIOD, SYMPTOM-FREE REQUIREMENTS, AND MEDICAL FOLLOW UP MUST BE CLEARLY 
INDICATED IN SECTION 12 (REMARKS). 
 
8. UNDERWAY TESTING. 
 
8.A. UNDERWAY OPERATIONS SHOULD CONTINUOUSLY ASSESS THE INTEGRITY OF A 
BUBBLE THROUGH CLI/ILI SCREENING. FOR PLATFORMS WITH EXPANDED TESTING 
CAPABILITY, TESTING STRATEGIES MAY BE EMPLOYED AS PART OF THE MITIGATION 
MEASURES IN 1.C.1 THROUGH 10, TO INCLUDE SYMPTOMATIC TESTING (DIAGNOSTIC) 
AND TARGETED OR WHOLE CREW TESTING (SCREENING). 
 
8.B. OPERATIONS, ACTIVITIES, AND ENGAGEMENTS DURING DEPLOYMENT MAY NOT 
ALLOW FOR PERSONNEL TO COMPLETE A 14-DAY ROM/SEQUESTRATION PRIOR TO 
EMBARKING/RE-EMBARKING A SHIP. COVID-19 SCREENING TESTING OF OPERATIONALLY 
AT-RISK PERSONNEL AND MISSION CRITICAL POPULATIONS MAY DETECT COVID-19 
INFECTIONS EARLY AND PRESERVE MISSION EFFECTIVENESS. 
 
8.B.1. OPERATIONALLY AT-RISK PERSONNEL, SUCH AS AIR CREW AND INDIVIDUALS 
ASHORE IN A COUNTRY WITH ACTIVE COVID-19 INFECTIONS, ARE AT THE GREATEST 
RISK OF EXPOSURE TO THE VIRUS. QUARANTINE THESE GROUPS FROM THE REMAINING 
CREW WHEN RE-ENTERING THE BUBBLE, INCREASE MEDICAL SCREENING AND SELF-
MONITORING EFFORTS AND WHEN AVAILABLE, TEST THESE INDIVIDUALS INTO AND OUT OF 
THE 14-DAY QUARANTINE, EFFECTIVELY CONDUCTING ROM-SEQUESTER AND SCREENING 
TESTING ONBOARD. 
 
8.B.2. COVID-19 INFECTION IN PERSONNEL WHO ARE CONSIDERED MISSION CRITICAL, 
SUCH AS CRITICAL CARETAKER CREW, AIR OPERATIONS CREW, AND REACTOR PERSONNEL, 
MAY DEGRADE OPERATIONS AND IMPACT THE MISSION. WHEN THERE IS A RISK OF 
INFECTION ONBOARD, PRIORITIZE MISSION CRITICAL CREWMEMBERS IN AN AFLOAT 
TESTING STRATEGY. 
 
8.B.3. THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR AN EFFECTIVE TEST-ROM SEQUESTER-TEST 
STRATEGY PROCESS TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN THE BUBBLE. DURING UNDERWAY 
OPERATIONS, BRIEF STOPS FOR PERSONNEL (BSP) OR EMBARKING PERSONNEL FROM 
FOREIGN PORTS MAY PRECLUDE THE ABILITY TO COMPLETE A 14-DAY ROM-SEQUESTER. 
QUARANTINE THESE PERSONNEL FROM THE REMAINING CREW MEMBERS FOR AT LEAST 
14 DAYS, INCREASE MEDICAL SCREENING AND SELF-MONITORING EFFORTS, AND, 
WHEN AVAILABLE, TEST THESE INDIVIDUALS INTO AND OUT OF THE 14-DAY QUARANTINE. 
 
9. POST-DEPLOYMENT AND REDEPLOYMENT. 
 
9.A. MILITARY MEMBERS RETURNING TO CONUS FROM DEPLOYMENT WILL COMPLETE 
A 14-DAY ROM AT HOME STATION. MEMBERS RETURNING VIA SHIP OR MILAIR WITH 
NO ACTIVE COVID-19 CASES WITHIN THEIR UNIT IN THE LAST 14 DAYS, MAY COUNT 
TRANSIT TIME (BEGINNING ON THE DAY OF DEPARTURE FROM THE LAST PORT OR 
AIRFIELD) TOWARD THE ROM REQUIREMENT. SERVICE MEMBERS ON POST-DEPLOYMENT 
ROM ARE RESTRICTED TO THEIR PERSONAL RESIDENCE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE 
DOMICILE AND MUST LIMIT CLOSE CONTACTS. 
 
9.B. REDEPLOYING INDIVIDUALS MUST BE SCREENED AT THE ASSIGNED PLACE OF 
DUTY OR POINT OF EMBARKATION. AT A MINIMUM, SCREENING WILL CONSIST OF 
COVID-19 QUESTIONNAIRE, ASSESSMENT OF EXPOSURE HISTORY, TEMPERATURE CHECK, 
CHECK FOR COVID-19 SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS LISTED IN PARAGRAPH 2.E., AND REVIEW 
OF ANY PAST COVID-19 TESTING. 
 
9.C. AT THE COMPLETION OF DEPLOYMENT, ALL PERSONNEL WILL COMPLETE A POST- 
DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT (DD FORM 2796) AND POST-DEPLOYMENT HEALTH 
REASSESSMENT (DD FORM 2900) IN ACCORDANCE WITH REF (F). 
 
9.D. ALL COVID-19 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS MUST BE ENTERED IN THE MEDICAL RECORD. 
SCREENING AND SURVEILLANCE TESTS THAT ARE INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE MUST 
BE ENTERED INTO THE MEDICAL RECORD. 
 
10. OUTBREAK INVESTIGATION AND CONTACT TRACING WORKFORCE TRAINING. 
 
10.A. RAPID AND THOROUGH CONTACT TRACING MINIMIZES OUTBREAKS AND IS 
CRITICAL TO MISSION SUCCESS. BELOW IS A TOOLKIT TO ASSIST WITH THE 
INVESTIGATION OF CASES OR AN OUTBREAK OF COVID-19 AND CONTAINS LINKS 
TO CONTACT TRACING TRAINING. THIS INFORMATION CAN BE USED BY MEDICAL 
AND NON-MEDICAL PERSONNEL TO WORK TOGETHER TO STOP THE SPREAD OF COVID-19. 
 
10.B. UNITS WILL TRAIN A MINIMUM OF TWO PERSONNEL FOR EVERY 100 PERSONNEL 
AT THEIR COMMAND. COMMANDS OF MORE THAN 500 PERSONNEL MUST TRAIN AT LEAST 
10 PEOPLE. SMALL UNITS MUST TRAIN A MINIMUM OF TWO INDIVIDUALS. MSC TRAIN 
CONTACT TRACERS FOR MSC VESSELS IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING MSC INSTRUCTIONS 
AND CONTRACTS. 
 
10.C. THE FOLLOWING COMPRISES THE CONTACT TRACING TRAINING:

19_CONTACT_TRACING_TRAINING.ASPX 
 
10.C.5. AFTER FINISHING THE TRAINING, THE TRAINED MEMBER WILL CONTACT THE 
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AT THE NEAREST NAVY MEDICINE READINESS AND TRAINING 
COMMAND (NAVMEDREADTRNCMD), OR THE COMMAND?S LOCAL MEDICAL PERSONNEL IF 
ASSOCIATED WITH A NAVMEDREADTRNCMD/OPERATIONAL UNIT, TO IDENTIFY A MENTOR FOR 
QUESTIONS, GUIDE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO CONTACT TRACING, AND ENSURE COMPLIANCE 
WITH RELEVANT MEDICAL AUTHORITY (E.G., COMUSFLTFORCOM SURGEON, COMPACFLT 
SURGEON, OR COMNAVSPECWARCOM SURGEON) GUIDANCE AND PROCEDURES WITH RESPECT TO 
CONTACT TRACING. THE RELEVANT MEDICAL AUTHORITY AND FACILITY MAY HAVE 
SPECIFIC FORMS OR PROCEDURES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT CONTACT TRACING BE A COORDINATED EFFORT BETWEEN THE TRAINED 
MEMBER AND THE LOCAL NAVMEDREADTRNCMD PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE WHEN IN GARRISON 
OR THE COGNIZANT TYCOM FOR OPERATIONAL UNITS. ADDITIONALLY, TIMELY ENGAGEMENT 
OF THE ASSOCIATED NAVY AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND PREVENTIVE MEDICINE UNIT (NEPMU) 
IS RECOMMENDED FOR AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO A LARGE OUTBREAK. 
 
10.D. THE FOLLOWING IS THE COVID-19 CASE INVESTIGATION CHECKLIST (APPLIES TO 
ALL CLINICALLY SUSPECTED OR CONFIRMED CASES) 
 
10.D.1. IMMEDIATE STEPS: 
   (1) IMPLEMENT APPROPRIATE CONTROL MEASURES. 
   (2) SEPARATE THE CASE FROM OTHER PERSONNEL. 
   (3) PLACE THE CASE IN ISOLATION (AS SOON AS POSSIBLE). 
   (4) FOR SHIPS THAT ARE PIER-SIDE, ONCE MEDICAL EVALUATION AND DISPOSITION 
HAS OCCURRED, ISOLATE CASES OFF OF THE SHIP WHENEVER POSSIBLE. 
   (5) FOR SHIPS THAT ARE UNDERWAY, ISOLATE CASES IN DESIGNATED SPACES, 
CONSISTENT WITH TYCOM/FLEET/COMMAND DIRECTION. 
 
10.D.2. WEAR APPROPRIATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) AS DIRECTED BY 
YOUR LOCAL MEDICAL AUTHORITY DURING ALL FACE-TO-FACE INTERACTION WITH THE 
CASE. 
COVID-19 SPECIFIC PPE INCLUDES (WHEN AVAILABLE) GOWN, GLOVES, NIOSH-CERTIFIED

MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE SOCIAL DISTANCING RECOMMENDATIONS. 
 
10.D.3. NOTIFY CHAIN OF COMMAND. 
 
10.D.4. NOTIFY SENIOR MEDICAL DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVE, DEPARTMENT OF 
DEFENSE (DOD) PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AUTHORITY, AND LOCAL CIVILIAN HEALTH 
DEPARTMENT (IF APPLICABLE) OF ANY CONFIRMED COVID-19 CASE. 
 
10.D.5. IF THE CASE(S) HAS BEEN ONBOARD THE SHIP DURING THE INFECTIOUS PERIOD 
(48 HOURS BEFORE SYMPTOM ONSET OR POSITIVE LAB UP TO THE TIME OF ISOLATION), 
ALL AREAS VISITED (WORKSPACE, HEADS, BERTHING, GYMS, ETC.) SHOULD BE CLOSED 
OFF IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO AEROSOLIZED VIRUS. WAIT 24 
HOURS (OR AS LONG AS PRACTICAL) FROM THE TIME THE CASE WAS LAST PRESENT IN 
SPACES BEFORE REENTERING THOSE AREAS TO CLEAN AND DISINFECT. 
 
10.D.6. BEGIN A CASE INVESTIGATION AS SOON AS A PERSON PRESENTS WITH 
COVID-19 LIKE ILLNESS (PUI). INTERVIEW THE CASE(S) OR PUI(S) AND REVIEW 
MEDICAL RECORDS (IF APPLICABLE) TO ASSESS VALIDITY OF THE DIAGNOSIS AND 
DETERMINE FOLLOW-UP RESPONSE MEASURES. 
   (1) IF DETERMINED NOT TO BE VALID, RESPONSE STOPS. CLOSED-OFF AREAS MAY 
BE RE-OPENED. 
   (2) IF DETERMINED TO BE A VALID CLINICALLY-SUSPECTED OR CONFIRMED CASE, 
PROCEED. 
 
10.D.7. CONDUCT A DETAILED CASE INTERVIEW. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE (IDEALLY 
WHEN CASE PRESENTS TO MEDICAL OR WITHIN 24 HOURS), COMPLETE THE CASE 
INTERVIEW AND CONTACT TRACING FORM AND CONTACT LIST FOR EACH CASE. KEY 
ASPECTS OF THE CASE INTERVIEW INCLUDE: 
   (1) ANY KNOWN HIGH-RISK EXPOSURE THAT THE CASE HAD (E.G. TRAVEL, CONTACT 
WITH A CONFIRMED COVID-19 CASE), AND TIMELINE OF EXPOSURE. 
   (2) SYMPTOM HISTORY (INCLUDING EXACT DATE OF ONSET OF ANY SYMPTOMS AND 
LIST OF SYMPTOMS). 
   (3) LIST OF ALL POSSIBLE CLOSE CONTACTS (PER DEFINITION ABOVE) WHO WERE 
EXPOSED TO THE CASE BETWEEN 48 HOURS PRIOR TO ONSET OF SYMPTOMS AND THE

IS ASYMPTOMATIC. CONTACTS OF CONTACTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED EXPOSED TO COVID-19. 
THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT TO MONITOR OR QUARANTINE CONTACTS OF CONTACTS, 
UNLESS THE INITIAL CONTACT LATER DEVELOPS SYMPTOMS AND BECOMES A CASE. 
   (4) DATE OF ISOLATION. ENSURE NO CONTINUED EXPOSURES ARE OCCURRING, 
ESPECIALLY WITH HOUSEHOLD CONTACTS. 
 
10.D.8. QUARANTINE ALL CLOSE CONTACTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER EXPOSURE 
TO THE CASE HAS BEEN VERIFIED. PEOPLE WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY TESTED POSITIVE 
FOR COVID-19 DO NOT NEED TO QUARANTINE FOR UP TO 3 MONTHS AS LONG AS THEY 
DO NOT DEVELOP SYMPTOMS AGAIN. 
 
10.D.9. IF INDICATED, COLLECT AND SHIP LABORATORY SPECIMENS TO THE 
APPROPRIATE DOD, COMMERCIAL, OR PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY CERTIFIED TO 
PERFORM COVID-19 TESTING (CHOSEN LAB AND SHIPPING PROCEDURES WILL BE 
DETERMINED BY LOCAL PROTOCOLS). DOCUMENT TEST RESULTS FOR ANY OTHER 
RESPIRATORY PATHOGENS (E.G. RAPID FLU, RESPIRATORY PANEL). 
   (1) FOR SHORE-BASED UNITS OR SHIPS THAT ARE PIER-SIDE IN HOMEPORT, 
FOLLOW SUPPORTING MILITARY TREATMENT FACILITY (MTF) OR LOCAL CIVILIAN 
PROCEDURES FOR COVID-19 TESTING. 
   (2) FOR SHIPS THAT ARE UNDERWAY, SHIP CAPABILITIES AND FLEET POLICIES 
WILL DETERMINE TESTING PRACTICES. EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO TEST 
AND CONFIRM THE PATHOGEN IF AN OUTBREAK IS SUSPECTED. 
 
11. ADDITIONAL ROM AND MEDICAL SCREENING CONSIDERATIONS. 
 
11.A. CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES. COMMANDERS MUST ENSURE ROM AND MEDICAL 
SCREENING GUIDANCE GIVEN TO DOD CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES CAN BE APPLIED 
CONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE CIVILIAN PERSONNEL LAW, REGULATION, AND
