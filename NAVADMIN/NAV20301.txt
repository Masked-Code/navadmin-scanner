RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the modification of the Naval Special 
Warfare Officer Retention Bonus (NSWRB) for qualified Naval Special Warfare 
(NSW) officers.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a).
Retaining NSW officers is a priority for the Navy.  The NSWRB is a flexible 
retention incentive that focuses on improving retention of NSW control grade 
officers.  NSW officers who meet the eligibility criteria in this NAVADMIN 
and hold an 1130 or 1137 designator may apply for this incentive.

2.  Program Overview.  This bonus is authorized under reference (b), section 
332.  As of 22 September 2020, eligible officers will be offered the 
opportunity to commit to a 5-year or a 3-year agreement for bonus amounts 
listed in paragraph 5.  NSW Program Management (OPNAV-N137) is designated as 
the NSWRB Program Manager.  All applications for this bonus will be submitted 
to the program manager for approval, payment processing and tracking.  The 
eligibility criteria stated in this NAVADMIN can be changed at any time by 
the program manager if a bonus reduction is warranted based on the needs of 
the NSW community.

3.  Eligibility.  NSW officers with designators 1130 or 1137, who have 
completed at least 15 years of Active-Duty commissioned service (ADCS), may 
be eligible to receive the NSWRB.  Applicants must receive written 
endorsement from their commanding officer (CO) recommending bonus approval.  
COs must ensure applications are accurate and verify applicants meet 
eligibility requirements.

4.  Program Execution
    a.  Officers must submit their request letter to the NSWRB program 
manager via their chain of command.
    b.  Upon acceptance of a bonus agreement by the program manager, the 
amount of the bonus becomes fixed and the officer incurs a firm service 
obligation.
    c.  Officers may elect one of the following payment options:
        (1)  To receive an initial lump sum payment of half the total bonus 
amount followed by equally divided annual installments through the term of 
the agreement.
        (2) To receive bonus payments in equal annual installments through 
the term of the agreement.
    d.  NSWRB requests for personnel who are being processed for officer 
designation removal or additional qualification designation removal will be 
held in abeyance pending final resolution of the action in question.

5.  Contract Terms.  NSWRB contract lengths and payments are outlined below.

service conditions for receipt of a bonus is entitled to the full amount of 
the bonus if the Service Member fulfills the conditions of that written 
agreement.  If the Service Member fails to fulfill the service conditions 
specified in the written agreement for the pay, then the pay may be 
terminated and the Service Member shall be required to repay an amount equal 
to the unearned portion of the pay.

8.  Point of contact is the Naval Special Warfare Officer Community Manager
