RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces that as part of the ongoing Navy Family 
Framework effort to expand and improve the experience for Navy spouses and 
families, Sailors may be reimbursed up to 500 dollars for the state licensure 
and certification costs of a spouse arising from relocation to another state 
due to a permanent change of station (PCS) move, in line with references (a) 
and (b).

2.  Policy.
    a.  A Service Member may be reimbursed up to 500 dollars for qualifying 
relicensing costs of their spouse when all of the following conditions are 
met:
        (1) The Service Member is reassigned, either as a PCS or permanent 
change of assignment from a permanent duty station (PDS) in one state to a 
PDS in another state.
        (2) The PCS movement of the dependents is authorized.
        (3) The spouse was employed in a profession requiring certification 
at the PDS in the previous state.
        (4) The spouse is required to obtain re-certification for the same 
profession at the PDS in the new state.
        (5) Completion of the relicense or certification was successful.
        (6) For PCS returning from OCONUS assignment, the license from the 
PDS state held prior to OCONUS may be used if the new CONUS PDS is in a 
different state.
    b.  The term *qualified relicensing costs* means costs, including exam 
and registration fees:
        (1) That are imposed by the state of the new PDS to secure a license 
or certification to engage in the same profession that the spouse of the 
Service Member engaged in while in the state of the previous PDS.
        (2) That are paid or incurred by the spouse to secure the license or 
certification from the state of the new PDS after the date on which the 
orders directing the reassignment of the Service Member are issued.
    c.  For the purposes of this spouse licensure reimbursement, initial 
assignment, career intermission program, separation or retirement orders are 
not considered PDS and the member will not be reimbursed.
