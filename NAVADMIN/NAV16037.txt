SUBJ/PASSING OF MASTER CHIEF PETTY OFFICER OF THE NAVY ROBERT J. WALKER, USN 
(RET)//

RMKS/1.  It is with heartfelt sadness that I report the passing of Master 
Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (MCPON) Robert J. Walker, USN
(RET) on 15 February 2016.  MCPON Walker enlisted in the United States Navy 
in 1948 when he was 19 years of age.  Following graduation from Recruit 
Training Command, he attended Radarman "A"
school in Boston, Massachusetts and was assigned to the USS MCKEAN (DD 74).

2.  Highlights of his 31 years of distinguished honorable service include the 
following accomplishments:
    a.  In 1975 he was appointed as the third Master Chief Petty Officer of 
the Navy.
    b.  He infused leadership training throughout the ranks and implemented 
the mandatory Petty Officer indoctrination course for all new E-4's.
    c.  In 1977 he was widely credited with shaping the Navy Senior Enlisted 
force by re-shaping the top tier Fleet, Force, and Command Master Chief 
program, and made a big push to create the Enlisted Surface Warfare 
Qualification.

3.  Following his retirement in 1979, he worked in the private sector, 
working with the Non-Commissioned Officers Association, moving up the ranks 
to President.  He later moved to work for the Jonathon Corporation, a ship 
repair and electronics business in Norfolk, VA.

4.  MCPON Walker is survived by his wife Fran and five children.  He was an 
inspiring leader and an exceptional shipmate who selflessly served his nation 
with honor, courage, and commitment.  He will be sincerely missed by his 
community and the Navy family.

5.  Released by Vice Admiral R. L. Thomas, Director, Navy Staff//
