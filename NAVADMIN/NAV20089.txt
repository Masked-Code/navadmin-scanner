SUBJ/VOLUNTARY EXTENSIONS FOR ACTIVE COMPONENT NAVY MEMBERS WITH APPROVED 
SEPARATION OR RETIREMENT DATES//

REF/A/NAVADMIN/OPNAV/212007ZMAR20//
NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 080/20, NAVY MITIGATION MEASURES IN RESPONSE TO 
CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK UPDATE 3.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the deliberate path of the Navy to mitigate 
the effects of COVID-19 and maintain operational, Sailor and family 
readiness.  Due to the uncertainty regarding the duration of the COVID-19 
Pandemic, the mandated all stop on PCS travel and the resulting effect on the 
U.S. economy, the incentives and extensions in this NAVADMIN will help 
provide some stability to both the Navy and our families.

2.  The Navy is accepting applications from officers and enlisted personnel 
who desire to delay their separation or retirement.
Service Members with an approved separation or retirement date before 1 April 
2021 are eligible to submit a request to their detailer to have their 
separation or retirement date delayed between 6 and 12 months (duration 
specified by Service Member).  All Service Members interested in extending, 
are invited to apply, but priority for approval will be given to those 
Service Members filling sea duty and critical billets.  Requests must be 
received by 1 July 2020.
Command endorsed requests to delay a separation or retirement date should be 
initiated through the appropriate detailer.

    a.  Service Members who are separating or retiring due to High Year 
Tenure (HYT) may apply for a waiver of their current HYT gate.
HYT waivers will be considered for up to an additional 12 months for enlisted 
Sailors filling critical operational billets both at sea and shore.  Requests 
will be approved on a case-by-case basis.
Sailors will submit a command endorsed Form 1306/7 Enlisted Personnel Action 
Request (ePAR) to My Navy Career Center (MNCC) via MyNavy Portal or by 
emailing the ePAR request directly to askmncc(at)navy.mil.

    b.  Service Members who are separating at their EAOS prior to 31 December 
2020 due to Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA) failures may request an 
extension to their EAOS until 31 December 2020 to enable participation in the 
fall PFA cycle and potentially regain reenlistment eligibility.  Extension 
requests under this guidance should be forwarded on a command endorsed Form 
1306/7 to MNCC via MyNavy Portal or by emailing the ePAR request directly to 
askmncc(at)navy.mil.  Officers should contact their detailers.
    c.  Enlisted Sailors with an approved separation or retirement date who 
are in billets that are eligible for Sea Duty Incentive Pay (SDIP) and who 
are approved for a voluntary extension as described above will receive SDIP 
for those extensions.  Exceptions to the timeline to request SDIP and to the 
length of extension for SDIP have been approved to accommodate these 
requests.  The latest SDIP eligibility chart can be found at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/pay-and-benefits.  This chart is updated 
periodically so check for recent additions.  For Sailors who are in an SDIP 
eligible billet, a Form 1306/7 ePAR should be submitted to MNCC at 
askmncc(at)navy.mil and your detailer.

    d.  While all Service Members are encouraged to apply, the following will 
not be approved:
        (1) Service Members pending mandatory separation or retirement for 
age.
        (2) Service Members approved for disability separation or retirement.
        (3) Officers who twice fail to select for promotion and whose 
separation or retirement is required by law.
        (4) Service Members being separated for misconduct.

3.  In addition to extensions for Service Members with approved separations 
and retirements, the Navy is opening up opportunity for separated Service 
Members to come back to Active-Duty.
Specifically, Service Members who have recently separated and are interested 
in reentry are encouraged to contact their local prior enlisted or officer 
recruiter.

4.  Questions regarding delaying a Service Members separation or retirement 
date should be referred to the appropriate detailer, community manager or by 
contacting MNCC.  The point of contact for questions regarding SDIP is Mr. 
Keith Tucker, PERS-40DD, 1-901-874-3545 or Keith.Tucker(at)Navy.mil.//
