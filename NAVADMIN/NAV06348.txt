MSGID/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/N1/DEC// SUBJ/INDIVIDUAL PERSONNEL 
TEMPO (ITEMPO) PROGRAM UPDATE// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN 
ANNOUNCES THE LATEST ITEMPO PROGRAM UPDATE AND SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS TO 
INCREASE GRANULARITY IN DOCUMENTING IA DEPLOYMENTS.
2.  THROUGHOUT THE NAVY S HISTORY, OUR SAILORS, ACTIVE AND RESERVE, 
HAVE BEEN CALLED UPON TO DEPLOY WITH UNITS OR DETACHMENTS IN SUPPORT OF 
NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS.
MORE RECENTLY, SAILORS HAVE BEEN CALLED TO DEPLOY AS INDIVIDUAL 
AUGMENTEES (IAS) IN SUPPORT OF THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM (GWOT).  IN 
LIGHT OF THIS BROADENING OF A  TYPICAL DEPLOYMENT,  IT IS ESSENTIAL 
THAT WE DILIGENTLY TRACK AND MANAGE DEPLOYMENT INFORMATION TO THE 
INDIVIDUAL SAILOR LEVEL.  NAVY S INDIVIDUAL PERSONNEL TEMPO (ITEMPO) 
PROGRAM, IN PLACE SINCE OCT 00, IS DESIGNED FOR JUST THIS PURPOSE.
3.  THE ITEMPO SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY USED TO DOCUMENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS 
OF EACH INDIVIDUAL SAILOR.  ITEMPO DATA CAN BE USED TO ASSIST IN THE 
ASSIGNMENT PROCESS FOR BOTH PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION (PCS) AND IA 
ORDERS, ANSWER QUERIES (BY CONGRESS, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OR OTHER 
AGENCIES SUCH AS THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION), DOCUMENT DEPLOYMENT OF 
IAS AND CORPSMEN ATTACHED TO FLEET MARINE FORCE UNITS (ENSURING THEY 
RECEIVE PROPER CREDIT FOR THEIR IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE GWOT), 
AND TRACK SAILOR LOCATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF OPERATIONAL HEALTH 
SURVEILLANCE.  ITEMPO ALSO DOCUMENTS DEPLOYMENT HISTORY OF THOSE 
SAILORS TRANSITIONING TO THE NAVY RESERVE; THIS SUPPORTS OUR INITIATIVE 
TO DEFER INVOLUNTARY MOBILIZATION FOR ACTIVE MEMBERS WHO AFFILIATE WITH 
THE NAVY RESERVE.
THE ITEMPO SYSTEM IS BEING MODIFIED TO IMPROVE ACCURACY IN DOCUMENTING 
IA DEPLOYMENTS AND TO MAKE THE SYSTEM MORE USER FRIENDLY IN THE SYSTEMS 
ABILITY TO PULL INFORMATION FROM THE DATABASE.
4.  NAVAL AUDIT SERVICE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED SOME GAPS IN ITEMPO DATA 
DUE TO MISUNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AT THE UNIT LEVEL 
AND A LACK OF ATTENTION TO THE UNIT WEEKLY ITEMPO STATUS REPORTS.  
ACCORDING TO THE NAVAL AUDIT SERVICE, SOME UNITS BELIEVED THAT ITEMPO 
REPORTING WAS NO LONGER REQUIRED; OTHER UNITS INITIATED ITEMPO EVENTS 
BUT ROUTINELY FAILED TO CLOSE THESE OPEN EVENTS.  IN SOME CASES, THE 
ITEMPO SYSTEM IS THE ONLY PLACE A SAILOR S COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT HISTORY 
IS MAINTAINED.
TIMELY AND ACCURATE REPORTING OF ITEMPO DATA IS ESSENTIAL TO THE 
SUCCESS OF THIS ENTIRE PROGRAM AND IT DEPENDS ON EVERY SAILOR TO HELP 
ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN ACCURATE, UP-TO-DATE DATA IN THIS SYSTEM.
5.  TO IMPROVE DATA ACCURACY, NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND RECENTLY COMPLETED 
A COMPREHENSIVE DATA VERIFICATION AND CORRECTION EFFORT, IN WHICH THEY 
CLOSED ITEMPO EVENTS LEFT OPEN SINCE BEFORE OCT 05.  THE NEXT STEPS TO 
RESOLVE EXISTING DATABASE ERRORS REQUIRE COMMAND ACTION.  ALL UNITS 
SHALL COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS NLT 30 JAN 07 (AND CONTINUE ITEMPO 
REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL CURRENT DIRECTIVES):
    A.  REVIEW ALL OUTSTANDING EVENTS ON THE EXPIRED EVENTS REPORT IN 
THE UNIT BUPERS ONLINE (BOL) MAILBOX.
IDENTIFY EVENTS WITH A PROJECTED END DATE ON OR AFTER 1 OCT 05 (OR 
EVENTS WITH A START DATE ON OR AFTER 1 APR 05) THAT LACK A PROJECTED 
END DATE.  CLOSE EACH DEPLOYMENT EVENT WITH THE ACTUAL STOP DATE.
    B.  REVIEW UNIT AND INDIVIDUAL DEPLOYMENT HISTORIES FOR ALL MEMBERS 
ASSIGNED.  AN OMITTED ITEMPO DEPLOYMENT EVENT MUST BE SUBMITTED FOR ANY 
DEPLOYMENT EVENT THAT BEGAN ON OR AFTER 1 OCT 05 (THE TRANSACTION CODE 
FOR UNIT DEPLOYMENTS IS  PUDO  AND FOR INDIVIDUAL DEPLOYMENTS IS  
PMDO ).
    C.  INCORPORATE A REVIEW OF INDIVIDUAL ITEMPO STATUS IN THE UNIT 
CHECK-IN AND CHECK-OUT PROCEDURES.  SUBMIT TRANSACTIONS AS NECESSARY TO 
CORRECT ERRORS UPON REPORTING OR PRIOR TO CHECKING OUT.
6.  A NEW SYSTEM ENHANCEMENT WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR DEPLOYABLE UNITS 
WITH WEB ACCESS DIFFICULTIES TO COMPLY WITH ITEMPO REPORTING 
REQUIREMENTS.  THESE UNITS WILL SOON BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD ITEMPO 
SOFTWARE AND THEIR UNIT ROSTER PRIOR TO DEPLOYING.  THE SOFTWARE 
ENABLES THE CREATION OF ITEMPO TRANSACTIONS IN AN OFFLINE ENVIRONMENT 
READY FOR BURST TRANSMISSION BACK TO THE SYSTEM WHEN WEB CONNECTIVITY 
IS AVAILABLE.  THIS FEATURE IS EXPECTED TO ROLL OUT IN JAN 07.
7.  THE ITEMPO SYSTEM IS ALSO BEING MODIFIED TO AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE 
A PERSONAL-FOR (P4) MESSAGE TO CO'S WHENEVER AN ITEMPO EVENT HAS A 
PROJECTED END DATE 60 DAYS OVERDUE LACKS AN END DATE (AND THE START 
DATE IS  OVER 250 DAYS EARLIER) OR WHEN ACTION IS NOT TAKEN ON THE LAST 
FOUR EXPIRED EVENT REPORTS SENT TO THE UNIT BOL MAILBOX.  IF 
DISCREPANCIES ARE NOT RESOLVED, THE SYSTEM WILL GENERATE ADDITIONAL 
MESSAGES 30 DAYS LATER, AND WEEKLY THEREAFTER, UNTIL CORRECTIVE ACTION 
IS COMPLETED.
  THIS NEW TICKLER SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY IN TESTING AND EXPECTED TO GO 
INTO SERVCE IN FEB 07.
8.  TO ENSURE CONTINUED, LONG-TERM COMPLIANCE WITH ITEMPO REPORTING 
REQUIREMENTS, A REVIEW OF COMMAND ITEMPO PROGRAMS WILL BE INCORPORATED 
INTO FLEET EXAMINING GROUP (FEG) INSPECTION VISITS (BOTH AFLOAT AND 
ASHORE).
9.  THE ITEMPO SECTIONS OF THE NPC HOME PAGE
(WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL) AND BOL (WWW.BOL.NAVY.MIL) PROVIDE SPECIFIC 
PROCEDURAL GUIDANCE (INCLUDING PREVIOUS NAVADMINS, UPDATES, FAQS, 
EXAMPLES, SYSTEMS USERS GUIDES, ETC.).

SAILORS  DEPLOYMENT HISTORY.  TODAY S SAILORS AND TOMORROW S VETERANS 
DEPEND ON EACH OF US TO TRACK AND MANAGE THEIR INDIVIDUAL DEPLOYMENT 
HISTORY TO ENSURE THEY RECEIVE PROPER CREDIT FOR THEIR PERSONAL 
SACRIFICES IN SERVICE TO OUR NAVY AND OUR NATION.
