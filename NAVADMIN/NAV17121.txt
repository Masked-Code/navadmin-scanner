SUBJ/MARKING 100 YEARS OF UNDERWAY REPLENISHMENTS//

RMKS/1.  MAY 2017 MARKS THE CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF OUR NAVYS MODERN 
UNDERWAY REPLENISHMENT (UNREP) CAPABILITIES.  THIS UNIQUELY AMERICAN 
OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY ENABLES THE NAVYS COMBAT LOGISTICS FORCE (CLF) TO 
PROVIDE A CRITICAL LIFELINE TO OUR OPERATING FORCES AT SEA.  THROUGH UNDERWAY 
REPLENISHMENT, THE CLF PROVIDES FUEL, AMMUNITION, FOOD, SPARE PARTS AND OTHER 
SUPPLIES NECESSARY TO ENABLE OUR CARRIER STRIKE GROUPS (CSGS) AND AMPHIBIOUS 
READY GROUPS (ARGS) TO OPERATE WORLDWIDE, WITH LITTLE TO NO RELIANCE ON HOST 
NATION SUPPORT.

2.  THE FIRST OPEN-OCEAN REPLENISHMENT OF A US NAVY WARSHIP WAS CONDUCTED BY 
CAPTAIN SILAS TALBOT IN DECEMBER 1799 ONBOARD THE USS CONSTITUTION.  BY USING 
SMALL BOATS TO REPLENISH, CONSTITUTION WAS ABLE TO STAY AT SEA FOR OVER 347 
DAYS, PROTECTING AMERICAN SHIPPING IN THE CARIBBEAN WHILE AVOIDING 
ENTANGLEMENTS IN FOREIGN HARBORS.  ON 28 MAY 1917, THEN LIEUTENANT CHESTER 
NIMITZ, EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF USS MAUMEE (AO 2), PIONEERED OUR MODERN METHOD 
OF UNREP, BY REFUELING SIX DESTROYERS EN ROUTE TO ENGLAND FOR OPERATIONS IN 
WWI.  DURING WWII, FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN UNDERWAY REPLENISHMENT, INCLUDING 
THE FIRST TRANSFER OF ORDNANCE, ENABLED THE NAVYS CARRIER TASK FORCES TO 
OPERATE INDEPENDENT OF FORWARD OPERATING BASES FOR MONTHS ON END.  FOLLOWING 
WWII, THE NAVY CONTINUED TO IMPROVE THE RELIABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS 
UNREP SYSTEM.  THERE ARE CURRENTLY OVER 390 FUEL AND CARGO DELIVERY STATIONS 
IN THE NAVY AND AN UNTOLD NUMBER AMONG OUR ALLIES, ALLOWING SHIPS FROM DOZENS 
OF NATIONS TO OPERATE TOGETHER FOR PROLONGED PERIODS AT SEA.

3.  TODAY, THE CIVILIAN MARINERS OF THE MILITARY SEALIFT COMMAND OPERATE AND 
MAINTAIN THE NAVYS 29 COMBAT LOGISTICS FORCE REPLENISHMENT SHIPS.  THE SKILL 
AND PROFESSIONALISM OF OUR SAILORS AND CIVILIAN MARINERS IN THE EXECUTION OF 
SAFE AND EFFICIENT UNREPS EACH YEAR ENABLE THE NAVY TO REMAIN ON STATION 
AROUND THE WORLD, PROTECTING AMERICA FROM ATTACK AND WHEN REQUIRED, ENABLING 
DECISIVE COMBAT OPERATIONS. BRAVO ZULU!//
