RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance for Unrestricted Line (URL) officers 
of the Active Component (AC) and Training and Administration of the Reserve 
(TAR) to request to defer consideration for a Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 Promotion 
Selection Board (PSB).

2.  References (a) through (c) authorize the Secretary of the Navy
(SECNAV) to approve the request of an officer to defer promotion 
consideration by a PSB convened under references (e) and (f).
Reference (d) delegates approval authority to the Chief of Naval Personnel 
(CNP).  Requests may be approved if all of the following conditions are met:
    a.  The basis for the request is to allow an officer to complete a 
broadening assignment, advanced education, or another assignment of 
significant value to the Department of the Navy (DON) or a career progression 
requirement is delayed by the assignment or education.
    b.  The exclusion from consideration is in the best interest of the DON.
    c.  The officer has not previously failed of selection for promotion to 
the grade for which the officer requests deferral.

3.  Eligible Officers.  All AC and TAR URL officers who are in-zone or above-
zone not previously considered for promotion to lieutenant commander, 
commander, or captain in FY26 and meet the requirements in paragraph 2 above 
may submit a request.
    a.  Examples of broadening assignments include, but are not limited to:
        (1) White House Fellowship.
        (2) Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellowship.
        (3) Federal Executive Fellowships (e.g., politico-military and 
cyber).
        (4) SECNAV tours with industry.
        (5) Legislative Fellowship.
    b.  Examples of advanced education include, but are not limited to:
        (1) Competitive education programs (e.g., Olmsted, Marshall, Rhodes, 
Fleet Scholar).
        (2) In-residence Naval Postgraduate School or Naval War College.
        (3) Equivalent service institutions or in-residence civilian

    c.  Examples of another assignment of significant value include, but are 
not limited to:

4.  Requests:
    a.  Requests shall include:
        (1) A description of the broadening assignment, advanced education, 
assignment of significant value, and career progression requirement delayed 
by the assignment or education.
        (2) Justification for requesting PSB consideration opt-out.
        (3) A recommendation from the commanding officer or equivalent.
    b.  E-mail requests to Bureau of Naval Personnel, Active Community 
Managers (BUPERS-31) at bupers3_optout.fct@navy.mil.
    c.  All requests must be received via e-mail no later than 26 July 2024.
    d.  Officers that require deferral for more than one FY must annually 
submit a new request to defer consideration.

5.  Staffing and review.  Officer requests shall be reviewed by a panel of 
(at a minimum), an Officer Community Management Branch (BUPERS-3) URL 
community manager, a Navy Personnel Command, Career Management Branch (PERS-
4) officer detailer, and one additional officer, all senior to the officer 
requesting to defer PSB consideration.  For nuclear trained officers, the 
Officer and Enlisted Nuclear Programs Policy Branch (OPNAV N133), shall be 
included on the panel.  For Naval Special Warfare Officers, the Naval Special 
Warfare Programs Policy Branch (OPNAV N137) shall be included on the panel.  
The panel will forward its recommendation to CNP via the community sponsor of 
the officer.

6.  URL community sponsor review.  The URL community flag officer sponsor for 
requesting officers shall provide a recommendation concerning all PSB 
deferral requests.  The community sponsor should consider the documented 
performance history of the officer and ability to provide future benefit to 
the Navy.  For disapproval recommendations, the community sponsor shall state 
the reasons for the disapproval recommendation.

7.  Officers will be notified in writing via e-mail of approval or 
disapproval of their request no later than 45 calendar days before the 
proposed convening date of the first FY26 PSB.

8.  Officers that are approved for PSB deferment, but are subsequently 
determined to be below-zone, will be considered below- zone by the FY26 PSB.  
Officers selected for promotion in subsequent years after deferring FY26 PSB 
consideration will be placed into a new promotion year group based on their 
resulting date of rank.
Those officers will be considered by future administrative and statutory PSBs 
with the new promotion year group.  The records of officers with approved 
deferrals of promotion consideration will not be identified or made known to 
any PSB.

9.  For additional details and application procedures and templates, visit

2025, whichever occurs first.
