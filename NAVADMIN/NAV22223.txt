RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes references (a) and (b), announces October 
2022 as National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, and provides guidance for the 
Fiscal Year (FY23) Cyber Awareness Challenge (CAC) training requirement. 
 
2.  Cybersecurity Awareness Month 
    a.  Cybersecurity is a Navy priority and Commander's business.  Any 
individual (officer/enlisted/active/reserve/dependent/civilian/contractor) 
logging on to a Navy information system is immediately on the front lines of 
the cyber battlespace. 
    b.  In October, we will share cybersecurity-related content via the 
Navy's media channels as part of the national campaign for raising 
cybersecurity awareness.  We are adopting the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency's theme of "See Yourself in Cyber."   
Individuals must make smart decisions at all network access points. 
    c.  Cyber compliance alone will not keep us safe.  The annual cyber 
awareness challenge does not equate to automatic defense of our networks.   
Being cyber ready translates to warfighting and mission readiness. 
        (1) You MUST follow policy.  You signed the Navy Acceptable Use 
Policy and completed your annual cyber awareness challenge.  You know what is 
and is not allowed on our networks.  Follow the rules. 
        (2) You MUST report.  When something does not look right, report 
it.  If someone is trying to do something that is not right, report it.  Do 
NOT accept "this is just the way things are" or "this is not a big 
deal."  Your Information Systems Security Manager (ISSM) and our 
cybersecurity professionals are responsible for determining where the 
reporting stops. 
    d.  Our adversaries are constantly working to exploit our 
vulnerabilities.  They have become more competent in challenging us by 
stealing our data and developing ways to compromise Navy systems and 
networks, including those that control our ships, aircraft, weapons, and 
infrastructure.  These incidents have a cost, and put our Sailors and 
maritime capabilities at risk. 
    e.  A single user can impact the global force, and vigilance by everyone 
will make the difference between continued mission success or failure to meet 
the tasking of our nation.  I appreciate your commitment to keeping the Navy 
safe by following cybersecurity best practices and policy each and every day 
of the year. 
 
3.  FY23 Cyber Awareness Challenge (CAC) 
    a.  Per references (c) and (d), Navy personnel, civilians, and 
contractors with access to unclassified or classified networks must complete 
the Department of Defense (DoD) employee version of CAC by 1 September 2023. 
    b.  Authorized methods for training delivery: 
        (1) Commands may complete CAC training using instructor-led 
delivery.  A command designated cyber security professional such as the ISSM 
or Cybersecurity Workforce Program Manager must provide the instruction, and 
utilize the course requirement ID set by Commander, Navy Installations 
Command/Total Workforce Management Service (TWMS) Administration (TWMS 
Requirement ID:  73944 - FY23 DoD Cyber Awareness Challenge).  This 
requirement cannot be waived. 
        (2) TWMS, https://twms/navy.mil/selfservice/login.asp; 
        (3) Navy e-Learning (NEL), https://learning.nel.navy.mil/; 
        (4) Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) website,  
https://cyber.mil/training/cyber-awareness-challenge/
        (5) DISA Digital Video Discs (DVDs). 
    d.  Ships can access the annual training from the NEL application hosted 
on the Navy Information/Application Product Suite (NIAPS) server, eliminating 
the need to reach back to shore hosted NEL websites.  The CAC 2023 course is 
available via the NEL Afloat Learning Management System Pub Amendment 112 for 
download by the NIAPS Administrator.  If unable to download Learning 
Management System Pub Amendment 112. 
    e.  Commanders are accountable for 100 percent completion of their 
personnel. 
    f.  Command training officers must validate or manually record training 
via TWMS or Fleet Training Management and Planning System (FLTMPS)  
(https://ntmpsweb.ncdc.navy.mil/fltmps/).  Report any discrepancies to the 
Navy Training Management Planning System Operational Support office at 
ntmps.support(at)navy.mil or (866) 438-2898/DSN 922-1867. 
    g.  The Command ISSM is responsible for reporting compliance to meet 
Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 requirements.   
Command ISSMs will disable accounts of users who do not complete training by  
1 September 2023 and maintain non-compliance list of accounts that were 
disabled. 
 
4.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.
