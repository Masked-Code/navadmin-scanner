GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  PER DIRECTION OF REF A, THE NAVAL WAR COLLEGE
CONDUCTED THE FIRST JOINT FORCE MARITIME COMPONENT COMMANDER (JFMCC)
COURSE FOR FLAG OFFICERS IN AUGUST 2005.  THIS PROGRAM SERVES AS THE
MARITIME FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT COMMANDER'S COURSE AND, AS SUCH, IS
THE COUNTERPART TO THE AIR FORCE'S JOINT FORCE AIR COMPONENT
COMMANDERS (JFACC) COURSE AND THE ARMYS JOINT FORCE LAND COMPONENT
COMMANDER'S (JFLCC) COURSE.  IT IS THE SENIOR COMPONENT OF THE
NAVY'S PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION CONTINUUM ESTABLISHED BY CNO
IN JULY 2004.
2.  THIS IS A PRACTITIONER'S COURSE WITH THE FOLLOWING GUIDING
PRINCIPLES:
- PREPARE FUTURE 3-STAR OFFICERS TO SERVE EFFECTIVELY AS MARITIME
COMPONENT COMMANDERS;
- DEVELOP PERSPECTIVES NECESSARY FOR FLAG AND GENERAL OFFICERS TO
GAIN A HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE WITH CONCEPTS, SYSTEMS, LANGUAGE,
AND PROCESSES TO EFFECTIVELY EMPLOY NAVAL FORCES IN A JOINT,
INTERAGENCY, AND MULTINATIONAL ENVIRONMENT;
- ADDRESS THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGES CONFRONTING THE COMMANDER AT THE
OPERATIONAL LEVEL OF WAR IN THE MARITIME DOMAIN;
- SERVE AS BOTH A FOUNDATION AND A CATALYST FOR NAVY CULTURAL
ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCELERATE THE EVOLUTION OF JFMCC CONCEPTS AND
CAPABILITIES; AND,
- IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF GRADUATES TO ARTICULATE THE ROLE OF THE
MARITIME COMPONENT IN THE DESIGN OF A CAMPAIGN PLAN TO ACHIEVE THE
EFFECTS DESIRED BY THE JOINT FORCE COMMANDER.
3.  OPERATIONAL LEVEL SCENARIO CHALLENGES WILL BE USED AS THE BASIS
FOR DISCUSSIONS AND STUDY.  FURTHER, THE JFMCC COURSE WILL CONSIDER
EXISTING JFMCC CONCEPTS AND DOCTRINE, OPERATIONAL-LEVEL
CAPABILITIES, COMMAND AND CONTROL PROCESSES AND APPLICATIONS, AND
THE CONSIDERATIONS AND EXPECTATIONS OF JOINT FORCE COMMANDER AND
OTHER FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT COMMANDERS.  IT WILL ALSO ADDRESS THE
NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR MARITIME SECURITY AND MARITIME DOMAIN
AWARENESS AS IT PERTAINS TO MARITIME HEADQUARTERS.  THE COURSE WILL
ALSO FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTEGRATED ARCHITECTURES AND
TRANSFORMATION RELATED METRICS SO THAT FUTURE JOINT FORCE MARITIME
COMPONENT COMMANDERS WILL SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVE STRATEGIC AND
OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES.  IN SHORT, THE JFMCC COURSE
WILL EDUCATE FUTURE MARITIME COMPONENT COMMANDERS TO EFFECTIVELY AND
EFFICIENTLY INTEGRATE OUR UNIQUE MARITIME CAPABILITES WITHIN THE
JOINT FORCE TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL AND NATIONAL OBJECTIVES.  IN
SUPPORT OF THESE OBJECTIVES, THE NUMBERED FLEET COMMANDERS WILL
PRESENT THEIR PERSPECTIVE REGARDING THE FUTURE OF THE JFMCC IN THEIR
RESPECTIVE AOR.
4.  THE NAVAL WAR COLLEGE WILL CONVENE THIS ONE-WEEK PROGRAM TWICE
IN CY 2006.  THE FIRST COURSE WILL BE 7-13 MAY 2006 IN NEWPORT
WHICH WILL ALSO INCLUDE ONE GENERAL-FLAG OFFICER FROM EACH OF THE
OTHER SERVICES (PLUS THE COAST GUARD).  THE SECOND COURSE OF CY 2006
IS TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED TO START ON 10 SEPTEMBER 2006.  SESSIONS
WILL BE HELD UP TO THE TS SCI CLASSIFICATION LEVEL.  THE JFMCC
FLAG-LEVEL COURSE WILL BE CONVENED AT LEAST TWICE PER YEAR AND WILL
TRANSISTION DELIBERATELY TO INCLUDE ALLIED AND COALITION MARITIME
OPERATIONS.  SENIOR MENTORS (RETIRED THREE AND FOUR STAR FLAG
OFFICERS/GENERAL OFFICERS) WILL ENSURE COURSE OBJECTIVES ARE MET.
WWW.NWC.NAVY.MIL/JFMCC CONTAINS ADDITIONAL COURSE INFORMATION AND

5.  SEATS IN THE MAY 2006 COURSE WILL BE LIMITED TO 12 NAVY FLAG
