RMKS/1. This NAVADMIN solicits applications for the AY 2016-2017 Pol-Mil 
Masters (PMM) program. IAW reference (c), the Navy has created the Naval 
Strategy Subspecialty (230X) as part of the CNO-directed Naval Strategic 
Enterprise (NSE). The PMM program is a cornerstone of the education portion 
of the Strategic Enterprise.

2. The PMM program provides Navy officers a graduate education in strategy 
and politico-military affairs at leading civilian institutions (CIVINS) 
throughout the United States. Approved officers will be selected for a one-
year master's degree program. The two-year PMM and Arthur S. Moreau Program 
listed in reference (a) are not funded and are unavailable per the annual 
quota plan for AY16-17. The PMM program is recommended for junior officers 
(O3-O4) who are completing their division officer or department head tours, 
but is open to O5 as well.
    a. Eligibility. All O3-05, including 02 selected for O3 and promoted 
prior to the start of the academic year Unrestricted Line (URL) officers, 
1710, 1810, 1820, and 1830 officers who have not already participated in a 
Department of Defense-funded graduate education program are eligible to 
participate. Officers who have earned a degree through the tuition assistance 
program or a Service war college retain their eligibility for PMM.
    b. Service Obligation. In accordance with enclosure (7) of reference (b), 
PMM graduates incur a service obligation equal to three times the number of 
months in the education program. IAW reference (c), URL officer graduates 
will earn the 2300P Naval Strategy subspecialty code as well as the 240 
Additional Qualification Designation (AQD). Non-URL graduates will earn the 
2000P National Security subspecialty code as well as the 240 AQD. PMM 
graduates will serve at least one tour in a validated subspecialty billet in 
either politico-military affairs or strategy and policy as soon as possible.
    c. Program specifics. Per reference (b), eight officers will be selected 
for the one-year program. Selected officers will carry a full academic load. 
PMM candidates should verify the university's work experience requirements 
and are advised to apply to at least three schools. In their university 
applications, prospective students should state that they are a Navy funded 
Politico-Military Master's candidate. Selection by the PMM board does not 
imply acceptance to a school. The approved AY 2016-17 institutions:
