NARR/REF (A) IS UNITED STATES CYBER COMMAND TASK ORDER 17-0019, ASSURED 
COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT SOLUTION (ACAS) OPERATIONAL GUIDANCE.  
REF (B) IS DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) INSTRUCTION, RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK 
(RMF) FOR DOD INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT).//

RMKS/1.  This policy is applicable to all Navy commands and both acquisition 
and non-acquisition programs, regardless of designation as Information 
Technology (IT), Weapon System, Platform Information Technology (PIT), or 
Control System.  U.S. Fleet Cyber Command (FLTCYBERCOM) will issue scanning 
implementation guidance via Navy Execute Order (EXORD).

2.  This policy mandates compliance with reference (a) and is issued to 
eliminate the significant administrative burden of processing repetitive 
waivers for specific situations.  The eight situational waivers listed in 
paragraph 4 can be applied to all components within the Assess and 
Authorization (AA) boundary or limited to specific components as appropriate.  
The system must maintain a valid authorization and apply an alternate form of 
compliance.  Acceptable alternate methods of determining and maintaining 
cybersecurity posture are provided by the Navy Information 
Technology/Cybersecurity Technical Advisory Board (Navy IT/CS TAB).

3.  Echelon II commands will maintain oversight and Programs of Record (POR) 
will document alternate form of compliance in the Risk Management Framework 
(RMF) System Level Continuous Monitoring (SLCM) Plan.  The Echelon II will 
verify annually the listing of systems (i.e., Enterprise Mission Assurance 
Support Service (eMASS) records) with exempt components to FLTCYBERCOM and 
Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare (OPNAV N2N6).

4.  Effective immediately, in accordance with reference (a), an Information 
System (IS) component may be waived from the Assured Compliance Assessment 
Solution (ACAS) scan requirement only if one of the following criteria 
identified below is met.
    a.  ACAS incompatible Operating System (OS) or Internetwork OS (IOS).  
The Security Control Assessor (SCA) will have concurred ACAS is incompatible 
and determined an alternate method of assessing control compliance in the 
Security Assessment Plan (SAP).
    b.  ACAS compatible OS or IOS that only uses a non-internet protocol 
connection (regardless of physical media).  ACAS may have been identified in 
the SAP to assess security posture in a lab (non -operational installation) 
but use of ACAS on fielded systems is not possible.
    c.  Disposable systems with integrated Information Technology (IT).  The 
Navy has a number of disposable systems that have IT built in, but the 
systems are designed to be disposable (e.g., Missile, Torpedoes, and 
Sonobuoys).  Only the disposable components within the AA boundary are waived 
from ACAS.
    d.  Research, Development, Test, and Engineering (RDTE) network Zone D 
enclaves.
    e.  Medical or weapons system that could potentially result in the loss 
of life.
    f.  Systems that have limited bandwidth where scanning negatively impacts 
mission execution.  In this case, scanning should still be implemented to the 
greatest extent operationally possible, such as periodically connecting to 
local networks for scanning when not operational.  Where systems can be 
scanned but bandwidth limitation restrict uploading and reporting, the scans 
should be reviewed locally.  The IT/CS TAB Cybersecurity Posture Process 
specifies scanning, documenting, and maintaining a system baseline for this 
exemption criteria.
    g.  Physically or Cryptographically (High Assurance Internet Protocol 
Encrypted (HAIPE)) isolated systems.  This includes Top Secret General 
Service (TS GENSER) systems, Radio Frequency (RF) control systems, NSA 
approved Commercial Solution for Classified, or systems that only communicate 
within a closed or isolated boundary.  This does not include Hypertext 
Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), or Virtual 
Private Network (VPN).
    h.  Systems that only use a Defense Switched Network (DSN) connection.

5.  If one of the exemption criteria in paragraph 4 is met, the Echelon II 
command will provide justification to the cognizant SCA and Authorizing 
Official (AO) for analysis and approval during the RMF process, preferably 
during Steps 1 and 2.  For example, if during the RMF SAP development, the 
SCA determines that, based on the criteria above, ACAS is not an appropriate 
tool for Cybersecurity posture scanning, they can provide that recommendation 
to the AO.  Systems that meet the criteria identified above, and that have 
received a situational waiver determination from the AO, shall document the 
exemption approval within the eMASS record in accordance with reference (b).

6.  All other situations require a full waiver from the Deputy Department of 
the Navy, Senior Information Security Officer (Navy) (DDSISO(N)).  Echelon II 
commands shall request an ACAS waiver in accordance with reference (a), 
preferably during RMF Steps 1 and

2.  Approvals shall be documented in the appropriate eMASS record by the 
Echelon II.

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until canceled or superseded.

8.  Released by VADM Matthew J. Kohler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
