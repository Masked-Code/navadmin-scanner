SUBJ/EVERY SAILOR IS A RECRUITER ADVANCEMENT POINTS OPPORTUNITY//

RMKS/1.  The purpose of this NAVADMIN is to provide information and solicit 
interest in the Navys recruiting referral program, Every Sailor is a 
Recruiter.  Commander, Navy Recruiting Command (CNRC) is asking all Sailors 
to help fill the ranks by sharing their Navy story, and providing a source of 
inspiration to the next generation of future Sailors.

2.  The goal of this program is to have Sailors share their experiences in 
the Navy with others who could benefit from what the Navy has to offer.  
Every Sailor is an ambassador for the Navy.
Your stories and experiences hold weight and influence within your circle and 
could be the reason someone chooses military service.

3.  If you meet someone you believe is a good fit for our Navy, text
*FLOC* to 764-764.  Doing so will link you to a survey page where you can 
provide their name and contact information which will allow a recruiter to 
engage with them.

4.  In order to incentivize Sailors to assist in this effort, CNRC has 
authorized a Flag Letter of Commendation (FLOC) (max of 2) for any Sailor who 
provides a referral that ultimately leads to a future Sailor contract.  These 
FLOCs are worth one point each towards advancement and can make all the 
difference when final multiple scores are calculated.

5.  The Navy saw something in you, when you see those same traits in others, 
share your positive experiences!  Every Sailor is a Recruiter, let us know 
when you find talent that can make our Navy even stronger!
