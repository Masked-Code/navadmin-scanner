RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN promulgates the CNO sponsored NCIS STAAT site visits 
for FY16 that have been coordinated with the installations and respective 
regions.  Contact any of the POCs, or your Navy Component Command, for the 
scheduled dates of a specific visit.  Changes to the schedule must be 
coordinated through the region, the respective Navy Component Commander, and 
OPNAV N462.

2.  Reference (a) provides a mission assurance-centric framework focused on 
ensuring resilience for the capabilities and assets supporting Navy core 
functions, using a risk management process across all protection and 
resilience programs.  Reference (b) directs the integration of select higher 
headquarters assessments under the Mission Assurance Program coordinated by 
Joint Staff.  The following programs fall under this program: Antiterrorism 
(AT), Continuity of Operations (COOP), Emergency Management (EM), Cyber 
Security (CS), Physical Security (PS); and Chemical, Biological, 
Radiological, Defense Critical Infrastructure Program and High-Yield 
Explosive (CBRNE) preparedness.  Effective FY16, CNO integrated vulnerability 
assessments will no longer be conducted.

3.  Mission Assurance site visits, whether conducted by Joint Staff or NCIS
STAAT, consist of three phases.  Phase I is both an in-house review of 
available data and a site visit to identify command missions (Pre-Site).
Phase II is a multi-day, detailed review of the installation and tenant 
commands, using reference (c).  Phase III, conducted after the site visit, 
analyzes the information obtained in Phase I and II, culminating in the 
official report, with recommendations.
