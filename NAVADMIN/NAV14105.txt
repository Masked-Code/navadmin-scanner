SUBJ/MILITARY SPOUSE APPRECIATION DAY//

RMKS/1.  ON MAY 9TH, WE CELEBRATE MILITARY SPOUSE APPRECIATION DAY.
WHILE OUR SAILORS SERVE IN ALL CORNERS OF THE WORLD PROTECTING AND DEFENDING 
OUR NATION, OUR SPOUSES ALSO SERVE AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD TO ENSURE OUR 
FAMILY REMAINS STABLE AND READY AT ALL TIMES TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF TODAY'S 
NAVY.  AS YOU CELEBRATE THIS SPECIAL DAY, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO PAY SPECIAL 
TRIBUTE TO THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS AND VALUABLE SUPPORT OUR MILITARY 
SPOUSES PROVIDE TO OUR NAVY TEAM.

2.  MILITARY SPOUSES ARE COURAGEOUS; THEY OVERCOME UNIQUE CHALLENGES WITH 
POISE AND DEDICATION IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY.  SPOUSES ARE THE LIFEBLOOD 
THAT SUSTAINS OUR SERVICE MEMBERS.  WHETHER DURING A TIME OF DANGER, DURING A 
DEPLOYMENT, WELCOMING SAILORS HOME, OR VOLUNTEERING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY, OUR 
SPOUSES ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE NAVY FAMILY.
THEY SERVE IN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT POSITIONS AS OMBUDSMEN AND IN FAMILY 
SUPPORT GROUPS TO SHARE THE BURDENS AND JOYS OF MILITARY LIFE.

3.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE MILITARY SPOUSES WHO PROUDLY EMBRACE A LIFE 
OF SERVICE.  OUR DEEPEST GRATITUDE GOES OUT TO OUR SPOUSES WHO SACRIFICE SO 
MUCH, AND WE VALUE AND RECOGNIZE THEIR SPECIAL SERVICE.
OUR SPOUSES ARE THE UNSUNG HEROES OF OUR NAVY, AND TODAY, WE SALUTE THEM FOR 
THEIR ENDURING DEDICATION TO THE NAVY FAMILY.
