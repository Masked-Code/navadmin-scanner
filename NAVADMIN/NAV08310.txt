AMPN/REF A IS CNO NAVY TRAFFIC SAFETY PROGRAM.  REF B IS CHAPTER II, 
MANUAL OF THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL// GENTEXT/REMARKS//1.  FAR TOO 
MANY OF OUR SAILORS HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR HAVE DIED IN PRIVATE 
MOTOR VEHICLE (PMV) AND MOTORCYCLE MISHAPS.  IN FY08, 33 SAILORS 
PERISHED IN MOTORCYCLE INCIDENTS ALONE.  THAT IS MORE THAN THE NUMBER 
OF SAILORS WE LOST IN OIF AND OEF COMBINED THIS YEAR.  THIS IS A 
TRAGEDY FOR OUR SERVICE, CONSTITUTES A SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENT TO NAVAL 
READINESS, AND REQUIRES GREATER VIGILANCE AT EVERY LEVEL OF COMMAND.  
2.  REF A, A LAWFUL GENERAL ORDER, REQUIRES SAFETY MEASURES FOR THOSE 
OPERATING OR RIDING IN PMVS AND THOSE OPERATING OR RIDING ON 
MOTORCYCLES.  VIOLATIONS OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE PUNISHABLE UNDER THE 
UCMJ.  THIS MESSAGE SUPPLEMENTS REF A BY IMPOSING ADDITIONAL REPORTING, 
TRAINING, AND MONITORING REQUIREMENTS.
3.  PROPER SEAT BELT USAGE DRAMATICALLY REDUCES THE CHANCE OF INJURY 
DURING MOTOR VEHICLE MISHAPS.  ALL MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE REQUIRED BY 
REF A TO WEAR A SEATBELT AT ALL TIMES, WORLDWIDE, WHETHER DRIVING OR 
RIDING AS A PASSENGER.  FAILURE TO WEAR A SEAT BELT WHILE DRIVING OR 
RIDING IN A PMV IS PUNISHABLE UNDER THE UCMJ.
4.  WITH REGARD TO MOTORCYCLES, TRENDS INDICATE AN INCREASE IN 
RECKLESSNESS AND NONCOMPLIANCE WITH TRAFFIC LAWS AMONG YOUNGER RIDERS, 
ESPECIALLY SPORT-BIKE RIDERS.  ACCORDINGLY, THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS ARE 
DIRECTED TO SAFEGUARD MILITARY PERSONNEL AND TO IMPROVE NAVAL READINESS.  
A.  MOTORCYCLE OWNERSHIP IS A SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY.  PRIOR TO 
PURCHASING A MOTORCYCLE, ALL MILITARY PERSONNEL WILL CONSULT WITH THE 
FIRST KHAKI IN THEIR CHAIN OF COMMAND TO BE CERTAIN THEY ARE AWARE OF 
THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT COME WITH OWNERSHIP.  THESE RESPONSIBILITIES 
INCLUDE PROPER LICENSING, INSURANCE, REGISTRATION, TRAINING, AND 
MANDATORY WEAR OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE).  REF A PERTAINS.  
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE AT 
HTTP://WWW.SAFETYCENTER.NAVY.MIL/ASHORE/MOTORVEHICLE/MOTOR
CYCLE.
B.  ALL MILITARY PERSONNEL WHO OWN A MOTORCYCLE, EVEN IF THEY DO NOT 
INTEND TO RIDE ON BASE, WILL PERSONALLY REPORT MOTORCYCLE OWNERSHIP TO 
THEIR COMMANDER, COMMANDING OFFICER, OR OFFICER IN CHARGE, VIA THE 
FIRST KHAKI IN THEIR CHAIN OF COMMAND WITHIN 48 HOURS OF RECEIPT OF 
THIS MESSAGE.  AS THIS IS A GENERAL ORDER, FAILURE TO REPORT OWNERSHIP 
OF A MOTORCYCLE IS PUNISHABLE UNDER THE UCMJ.  COMMANDERS, COMMANDING 
OFFICERS, AND OFFICERS IN CHARGE ARE TO ENSURE 
DISTRIBUTION OF THIS NAVADMIN TO ALL HANDS.    
C.  COMMANDERS, COMMANDING OFFICERS, OFFICERS IN CHARGE, OR THE SENIOR 
NAVAL MEMBER ASSIGNED TO AGENCIES OR ORGANIZATIONS HEADED BY A CIVILIAN 
ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN AN ACCURATE LIST OF MILITARY MOTORCYCLE RIDERS 
IN THEIR COMMAND, UNIT, AGENCY, OR ORGANIZATION.  THESE OFFICERS MUST 
ENSURE THAT ALL RIDERS HAVE A VALID MOTORCYCLE DRIVER'S LICENSE, 
VEHICLE REGISTRATION FOR STREET MOTORCYCLES, REQUIRED INSURANCE, AND 
HAVE ATTENDED OR ARE SCHEDULED TO ATTEND THE REQUIRED MOTORCYCLE SAFETY 
FOUNDATION (MSF) TRAINING COURSES, TO INCLUDE REQUIRED REFRESHER 
TRAINING AT THE INTERVALS PRESCRIBED IN REF A.  MOTORCYCLE TRAINING 
POCS BY REGION ARE LISTED AT 
HTTP://WWW.SAFETYCENTER.NAVY.MIL/ASHORE/MOTORVEHICLE/MOTOR
CYCLE-TRAINING-POC.ASP.  ADDITIONALLY, THEY WILL APPOINT A COMMAND 
MOTORCYCLE SAFETY REPRESENTATIVE WHO WILL REPORT THE COMMAND'S 
MOTORCYCLE RIDER DEMOGRAPHICS TO THE IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR IN COMMAND 
(ISIC) AND ON THE MOTORCYCLE CENSUS LOCATED ON THE NAVAL SAFETY 
CENTER'S WEB SITE AT 
HTTP://WWW.SAFETYCENTER.NAVY.MIL/ASHORE/MOTORVEHICLE/MOTOR
CYCLE/REGISTER.CFM.
D.  ISIC'S ARE DIRECTED TO TAKE THE LEAD IN ENSURING THE APPROPRIATE 
ACTIONS FROM THEIR SUBORDINATE COMMANDS ARE COMPLETED AS DIRECTED IN 
THIS MESSAGE AND RESULTS ARE REPORTED UP THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.  WITHOUT 
THAT LEVEL OF LEADERSHIP INVOLVEMENT, THE INTENT OF THIS IMPORTANT 
SAFETY PROGRAM WILL NOT BE ACHIEVED.
E.  ECHELON II COMMANDERS WILL CONSOLIDATE THE MOTORCYCLE DEMOGRAPHIC 
REPORTS FOR ALL SUBORDINATE COMMANDS AND PROVIDE A WRITTEN OR 
ELECTRONIC REPORT OF THAT INFORMATION TO CNO N1, CNIC (N35) AND 
COMNAVSAFECEN (CODE 42) BY 14 NOVEMBER 08. 
F.  CNIC IN COORDINATION WITH CNO N1 AND COMNAVSAFECEN WILL PROVIDE 
QUARTERLY TRAINING UPDATES FOR THE TONE OF THE FORCE REPORT. 
G.  COMMANDS SHALL ENCOURAGE MILITARY PERSONNEL TO COMPLETE THE MSF 
MOTORCYCLE SAFETY COURSE PRIOR TO PURCHASE OF THE MOTORCYCLE ON 
INSTALLATIONS WHERE THE MOTORCYCLE SAFETY TRAINING PROGRAM PROVIDES A 
MOTORCYCLE FOR USE IN THE COURSE.  
COMMANDERS SHALL ALLOW MOTORCYCLE RIDERS TO ATTEND THE REQUIRED MSF 
TRAINING DURING WORKING HOURS.  
5.  MILITARY PERSONNEL MUST MEET ALL APPLICABLE LICENSING, REGISTRATION, 
INSURANCE, AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS BEFORE STREET RIDING.  VIOLATION 
IS PUNISHABLE UNDER THE UCMJ.  
6.  REF A MANDATES THAT ALL MILITARY PERSONNEL WEAR PPE WHILE RIDING A 
MOTORCYCLE.  FAILURE TO WEAR REQUIRED PPE WHILE RIDING 
A MOTORCYCLE IS PUNISHABLE UNDER THE UCMJ.   
7.  LINE OF DUTY/MISCONDUCT DETERMINATIONS.  RECKLESS OR UNSAFE 
OPERATION OF MOTOR VEHICLES OR MOTORCYCLES NOT ONLY JEOPARDIZES LIFE 
AND LIMB, BUT ALSO NAVY CAREERS AND THE BENEFITS THAT MILITARY 
PERSONNEL OR THEIR FAMILIES MAY DEPEND ON IN THE EVENT OF INJURY OR 
DEATH.  LEADERSHIP AT EVERY LEVEL MUST ENSURE OUR SAILORS UNDERSTAND 
JUST HOW MUCH RIDES ON THE DECISIONS THEY MAKE AND THE RISKS THEY 
ASSUME.  REF B PERTAINS.
8.   DON CIVILIAN PERSONNEL ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE 
SAFETY POLICIES IN REF A AT ANY TIME WHILE OPERATING A MOTOR VEHICLE OR 
MOTORCYCLE ON A NAVY INSTALLATION AND WHILE CONDUCTING OFFICIAL DON 
DUTY OFF-BASE IN A PMV OR PRIVATELY OWNED MOTORCYCLE.  THIS INCLUDES 
SEAT BELT USAGE IN PMVS, AS WELL AS MOTORCYCLE LICENSING, REGISTRATION, 
TRAINING, INSURANCE, AND PPE REQUIREMENTS.  AS THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE 
FOR THE TOTAL FORCE, ALL DON CIVILIAN PERSONNEL ARE REQUESTED TO NOTIFY 
THEIR COMMANDER, COMMANDING OFFICER, OFFICER IN CHARGE, VIA THEIR 
SUPERVISOR, THAT THEY OWN AND/OR OPERATE A MOTORCYCLE.
9.  SAFETY PROGRAMS DO NOT REPLACE LEADERSHIP, BUT THEY DO PROVIDE 
ADDITIONAL TOOLS FOR NAVAL LEADERS.  THESE ACTIONS PROVIDE OUR 
MOTORCYCLE RIDERS THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING THEY NEED TO AVOID OR 
SURVIVE A MOTOR VEHICLE OR MOTORCYCLE MISHAP.  COMMANDS WILL ENSURE 
STRICT ADHERENCE TO THIS NAVADMIN AND APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.  THIS 
WILL SET THE FOUNDATION OF PROPER PRACTICES THAT WILL HELP ENSURE THE 
SAFETY OF OUR MILITARY AND DON CIVILIAN PERSONNEL WHEN ON THE ROAD.
