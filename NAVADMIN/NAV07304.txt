SUBJ/CHANGE TO E7 FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE (FMS)// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES A CHANGE TO THE E7 FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE (FMS) EFFECTIVE WITH THE ACTIVE/FULL TIME SUPPORT (FTS) EXAM CYCLE 198 (JANUARY 08) AND RESERVE EXAM CYCLE 082 (FEBRUARY 08) ADVANCEMENT EXAMINATIONS.  THE GOAL OF THIS ADJUSTMENT IS TO PROVIDE OUR BEST PERFORMERS EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IT TO THE CPO SELECTION BOARD.  SIMILAR TO THE CHANGES MADE TO THE E4-E6 FMS (NAVADMIN 183/07), THIS NEW CALCULATION PLACES GREATER WEIGHT ON SUSTAINED SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE (PERFORMANCE MARK AVERAGE (PMA) ON
EVALUATIONS) AND DECREASES THE WEIGHT OF THE EXAM, MAKING THE TWO WEIGHTS EVEN.  THIS CHANGE PROVIDES SUPERIOR PERFORMERS WITH AN ENHANCED OPPORTUNITY TO REACH THE SELECTION BOARD, WHILE PRESERVING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE WITH ADEQUATE EVALUATIONS AND EXCEPTIONAL TEST SCORES TO ALSO BECOME SELECTION BOARD ELIGIBLE.
2.  CHANGES TO THE FMS INCREASE THE MAXIMUM POINTS AND SPREAD OF THE PMA CALCULATED FROM ADVANCEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS ON SAILORS EVALUATIONS.  THE MAXIMUM POINTS FOR THE PMA ARE NOW EQUAL TO THE MAXIMUM POINTS POSSIBLE FROM THE EXAM STANDARD SCORE (SS).  THE DIFFERENCE IN PMA POINTS BETWEEN EARLY PROMOTE, MUST PROMOTE AND PROMOTABLE HAS ALSO INCREASED FROM 2.6 POINTS TO 10 POINTS.
3.  THE NEW FMS COMPUTATION IS AS FOLLOWS:
FACTOR          COMPUTATION         MAXIMUM POINTS       PERCENTAGE
PMA             (PMA*50)-120        80                   50 PERCENT
EXAM            AS INDICATED        80                   50 PERCENT
SS              ON PROFILE SHEET
TOTAL                               160
4.  THIS CHANGE WILL GIVE TALENTED ACTIVE AND RESERVE NAVY FIRST CLASS PETTY OFFICERS A GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO SELECT FOR CHIEF PETTY OFFICER.
