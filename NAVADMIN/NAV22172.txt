RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and provides updated 
advance-to-position (A2P) guidance which will be employed beginning 
with the 1 August 2022 MyNavy Assignment (MNA) Cycle.  The A2P 
Program now includes Active Component E-4 and E-5 Sailors in non- 
detailing marketplace assignment policy (DMAP) ratings and allows 
them to apply for select E-5 and E-6 jobs, respectively, when in 
their detailing window.  Guidance provided in this NAVADMIN does not 
apply to DMAP ratings (Currently:  CS, GSM, ABF, and ABH), who 
remain eligible for DMAP incentives, including DMAP A2P, as 
described in references (b) and (c). 
 
2.  Sailors selected for A2P opportunities under this NAVADMIN will 
be permanently advanced and paid upon reporting to an A2P job at 
their ultimate duty station, following successful completion of any 
required en-route training.  Sailors also maintain eligibility for 
all other advancement programs that they would be eligible for even 
after selection for A2P, and may advance sooner via any other 
advancement program for which they are selected.  Sailors selected 
for an A2P assignment will receive permanent change of station (PCS) 
orders, if required, in line with current detailing business rules. 
 
3.  A2P opportunities will be identified by the manning control 
authority (MCA), in coordination with fleet readiness integrators 
(FRI), based on existing prioritization processes.  Selected A2P 
opportunities will then be published within each MNA cycle. 
Applicants will only be considered for the A2P jobs for which they 
are qualified and have applied.  Sailors may apply to sea duty A2P 
jobs, regardless of sea or shore flow considerations.  Sailors on 
shore duty who are due to rotate to sea duty will not be considered 
for shore duty jobs, but are encouraged to apply for sea duty A2P 
jobs. 
 
4.  Eligibility requirements are not waiverable.  To be eligible, 
applicants must: 
    a.  Be an Active Component Sailor. 
    b.  Be an E-4 or E-5. 
    c.  Not be in a DMAP rating. 
    d.  Be within the order negotiation window. 
    e.  Have passed the most recent Navy wide advancement exam 
(NWAE) for the paygrade to which they are applying. 
    f.  Have successfully completed the professional military 
knowledge eligibility exam requirement for the paygrade to which 
they are applying. 
    g.  Be eligible for advancement to the next higher paygrade in 
line with reference (d). 
    h.  Obligate service (OBLISERV) for the entirety of the 
designated A2P tour length. 
    i.  Be generally qualified to fill the job for which they apply, 
with the exception of any en-route training requirements. 
Prerequisites for any required en-route training must be met prior 
to applying for an A2P job.  Sailors may view any job requirements 
(required schools in-route, Navy enlisted classifications (NEC), 
etc.) on MNA by clicking on the NEC hyperlink and review 
requirements and Navy training information.  Sailors should contact 
their rating detailer if they have any questions regarding 
qualifications needed to fill a specific A2P job. 
 
5.  Jobs identified for the A2P Program will appear in the *Advance 
to Position* category in MNA (note that this is different than the 
DMAP marketplace).  Depending on your rating and paygrade, A2P 
opportunities may not be advertised every MNA cycle as the MCA and 
FRIs prioritize and fill different Fleet priorities each cycle.  To 
ensure advertised jobs for this program are displayed, Sailors 
should verify the *Advance to Position* category is selected in the 
optional input portion of the MNA job search page.  Sailors should 
submit applications to the jobs in the same manner as standard cycle 
applications. 
 
6.  All A2P applicants will be graded utilizing a Sailor scoring 
criteria, a sample of which is available on the detailing 
marketplace tab of MyNavy HR website.  Candidates who have passed, 
but not advanced via the most recent NWAE, and are eligible for 
advancement to the next higher paygrade will be selected on a 
competitive basis using the following considerations: 
    a.  Billet requirements for the job applied to, including rate, 
paygrade, and NEC (if applicable). 
    b.  Sailor preference, application ranking, receiving command 
comments, and final multiple score. 
    c.  Sailors having or possessing the ability to obtain any 
required critical skills for the job. 
    d.  Needs of the Navy (availability of PCS funds, etc.). 
 
7.  After obligating service and completing any required screening, 
Sailors selected for A2P jobs should be frocked by losing command 
prior to transfer.  Gaining commands will submit PCS orders and key 
supporting documentation to transaction service center or joint base 
personnel support detachment to allow Sailors to be permanently 
advanced upon reporting.  The effective date of paygrade will be the 
report date to the ultimate duty station.  The completion of the PCS 
orders execution and reporting onboard will serve as the authority 
to advance.  Sailors who fail to successfully complete en-route 
training or schools required for the performance of an A2P job will 
not be advanced, regardless of whether or not they continue to 
execute orders to the ultimate duty station.
