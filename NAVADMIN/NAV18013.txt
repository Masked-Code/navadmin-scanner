RMKS/1. This message convenes and provides administrative updates for the 
execution of the Naval Research Working Group (NRWG) 18 meeting, 10-12 Apr
2018 at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), Monterey, CA.

2. Per Ref A, the NRWG meeting will convene aboard NPS in order to address 
current and future naval research requirements, integrate NPS faculty into 
the total naval R&D capability, and disseminate the knowledge gained from 
these research projects to stakeholders.

3. NRWG meeting participants include NPS students, faculty, staff, and 
individuals from Navy and Marine Corps agencies who have research or analysis 
needs.  These agencies are termed topic sponsors.

4. NRWG 18 will follow the same format as NRWG 17. Each topic sponsor will be 
assigned a tradeshow booth in the NPS McNitt Ballroom where they will be able 
to discuss research opportunities with NPS faculty and students.  There will 
no longer be a plenary session or revolving panel sessions where topic 
sponsors present research topics.  Topic sponsors should enter research 
topics in the topic portal on the NPS Naval Research Program
(NRP) website no later than 19 Mar 2018 in order to be included in the NRWG 
program. The topic portal is located at 
https:(slash)(slash)my.nps.edu/nrp/topic-portal.  For those without an NPS 
login, a CAC card is required to log in.  Additionally, each attending topic 
sponsor POC may coordinate In-Progress Reviews (IPRs) during NRWG 18 with 
faculty and students currently conducting sponsored research projects.
