MSGID/GENADMIN/CNOWASHINGTON DC/-/APR// SUBJ/ NAVY 2009 EARTH DAY 
MESSAGE// 
RMKS/1.   ON APRIL 22 THE NAVY AND THE NATION, WILL CELEBRATE EARTH 
DAY.  THIS YEAR'S THEME IS "PARTNERING FOR THE PLANET."  
2.  PARTNERING WITH OTHER MILITARY SERVICES, FEDERAL AND STATE 
AGENCIES, INDUSTRY, ACADEMIA AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, THE 
NAVY IS ACHIEVING REMARKABLE SUCCESS IN PROTECTING AND ENHANCING THE 
ENVIRONMENT, ENERGY MANAGEMENT AND CARBON FOOTPRINT REDUCTION.  LED 
BY TASK FORCE ENERGY, THE NAVY IS TRANSFORMING ENERGY PRODUCTION AND 
CONSUMPTION PRACTICES ASHORE, AFLOAT, AND IN THE AIR.  MORE EFFICIENT 
USE OF FOSSIL FUELS, COUPLED WITH INCREASED RELIANCE ON ALTERNATIVE 
ENERGY, WILL MINIMIZE STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL DEPENDENCE ON VOLATILE AND 
VULNERABLE ENERGY SOURCES.  WE WILL ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR 
CARBON FOOTPRINT.  WHILE MUCH WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE, IMPRESSIVE 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ACHIEVED.  THESE INCLUDE:
 - GEOTHERMAL. NAVAL AIR WEAPONS STATION (NAWS) CHINA LAKE, CALIFORNIA, 
HAS A 270 MEGAWATT GEOTHERMAL PLANT. DELIVERING AN AVERAGE OF 1.4 
MILLION MEGAWATT-HOURS (MWH) OF ELECTRICITY ANNUALLY TO THE CALIFORNIA  
ELECTRIC GRID, THIS PLANT IS THE LARGEST RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCER IN 
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND THE THIRD LARGEST GEOTHERMAL ELECTRICITY 
PRODUCER IN THE U.S. 
-  PHOTOVOLTAIC. THE NAVY HAS SOLAR POWER PROJECTS IN NUMEROUS 
LOCATIONS.  COMMANDER NAVY REGION SOUTHWEST (CNRSW) PHOTOVOLTAIC 
SYSTEMS COLLECTIVELY PRODUCE 700 MWH OF ELECTRICITY PER YEAR. COMMANDER 
NAVY REGION HAWAII HAS A 309 KW SOLAR ELECTRIC ROOFTOP ON TOP OF FORD 
ISLAND'S BUILDING 54. THIS SYSTEM IS THE LARGEST FEDERAL PHOTOVOLTAIC 
ARRAY IN HAWAII, COVERING 31,000 SQUARE FEET AND PRODUCING MORE THAN 
400 MWH PER YEAR. CONSTRUCTION OF SEVERAL OTHERS AT OUR EAST COAST 
BASES WILL BEGIN SHORTLY USING FUNDING RECEIVED FROM THE AMERICAN 
RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACTOF 2009.
-  WIND. NAVAL BASE GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA HAS FOUR WIND TURBINES WITH A
COMBINED CAPACITY OF 3.8 MEGAWATTS, PRODUCING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO 
SUPPLY ABOUT 25 PERCENT OF THE PEAK POWER NEEDED TO OPERATE THE BASE. 
THE PROJECT REDUCES THE CONSUMPTION OF DIESEL FUEL BY 325,000 GALLONS 
PER YEAR, REDUCES AIR POLLUTION BY ELIMINATING SULFUR DIOXIDE, NITROUS 
OXIDE, AND GREENHOUSE GASES, AND SAVES THE TAXPAYERS MILLIONS  IN 
ANNUAL ENERGY COSTS.   ADDITIONALLY, THE NAVY HAS THREE WIND TURBINES 
ON SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND WITH A COMBINED PRODUCTION CAPABILITY OF 675 
KILOWATTS.
-  FUEL CONSUMPTION FOR NAVY SHIPS. THE NAVY'S INCENTIVIZED ENERGY 
CONSERVATION (I-ENCON) PROGRAM TAKES ADVANTAGE OF "SMART STEAMING" 
PRACTICES TO REDUCE SHIP'S FUEL CONSUMPTION. I-ENCON PROVIDES TRAINING 
AND REWARDS LEADING FUEL CONSERVERS WITH SPECIAL RECOGNITION AND CASH 
INCENTIVES TO COMMANDING OFFICER'S DISCRETIONARY FUNDS. IN ADDITION, 
NAVAL SEA SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVSEA) HAS INSTALLED STERN FLAPS ON 
APPROXIMATELY 100 SURFACE COMBATANTS. STERN FLAPS CREATE AN OPTIMAL 
HYDRODYNAMIC PROFILE THAT REDUCES FUEL CONSUMPTION AND ENHANCES 
MILITARY CAPABILITY BY INCREASING THE TOP SPEED OF CRUISERS AND 
DESTROYERS. OTHER FUEL SAVING EXAMPLES INCLUDE HULL AND PROPELLER 
COATINGS THAT REDUCE DRAG, AND TRIM LOOP BOILER CONTROL SYSTEMS THAT 
OPTIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY USED TO CREATE STEAM FOR SHIPBOARD 
APPLICATIONS.
-  TACTICAL VEHICLES.  THE NAVY IS LOOKING AT WAYS TO MAKE TACTICAL 
VEHICLES MORE FUEL-EFFICIENT. A JOINT GOVERNMENT-INDUSTRY-ACADEMIA 
GROUP RECENTLY EVALUATED OVER 100 TECHNOLOGIES FOR CONCEPT VEHICLES 
THAT INCORPORATE LIGHTWEIGHT MATERIAL AND FUEL-EFFICIENT DESIGN. THE 
ACQUISITION COMMUNITY IS CONSIDERING THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR FUTURE 
VEHICLE PROCUREMENTS. WE ARE ALSO EXPLORING COMPACT, MOBILE FUEL CELL 
SYSTEMS TO POWER CRITICAL VEHICLE EQUIPMENT SUCH AS RADIOS, COMPUTERS 
AND GPS SYSTEMS SILENTLY AND WITHOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL EMISSIONS 
ASSOCIATED WITH CONVENTIONAL POWER SOURCES.
- SHIPBOARD AIR-CONDITIONING (AC).  SHIPBOARD AC PLANTS HAVE BEEN MADE 
MUCH MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT.  CONVERSION KITS IMPROVE THE ENERGY 
EFFICIENCY OF AC PLANTS UP TO 15 PERCENT AND AC PLANTS BEING INSTALLED 
ON NEW CONSTRUCTION SHIPS ARE 20-35 PERCENT MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT THAN 
THE OLDER AC PLANT DESIGNS.  NAVY RECEIVED AN EPA CLIMATE PROTECTION 
AWARD FOR THESE EFFORTS AND CONTINUES RESEARCH INTO TECHNOLOGIES THAT 
WILL FURTHER IMPROVE THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF FUTURE SHIPBOARD AC 
PLANTS.
3.  LOOKING TO THE FUTURE, WE WILL SOON BE USING THE AMERICAN RECOVERY 
AND REINVESTMENT ACT ENERGY FUNDING TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND 
FIELDING OF SYSTEMS TO REDUCE FOSSIL FUEL CONSUMPTION AND OPERATIONAL
VULNERABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH A LAND OR SEA FUEL TETHER.  NEW SYSTEMS
UNDER DEVELOPMENT INCLUDE:  HYBRID ELECTRIC DRIVES TO POWER SURFACE 
COMBATANTS; A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND CLEANER F/A-18 ENGINE; NEW 
PROTOCOLS FOR FUEL ALTERNATIVES, BOTH SYNTHETIC AND BIOFUELS; OCEAN 
THERMAL ENERGY POWER PLANTS; SMART-GRIDS SUPPORTING OUR SHORE 
INFRASTRUCTURE; AND POWER EFFICIENCY MODIFICATIONS TO TACTICAL VEHICLES 
AND THEIR HVAC AUXILIARIES.  
4.  OUR NAVY CONTINUES TO BE AN ENVIRONMENTAL LEADER AND STEWARD.  
THE NAVY'S PREPOSITIONED OIL SPILL CLEANUP ASSETS ARE A KEY PART OF THE 
NATION'S RESPONSE NETWORK, PARTNERING WITH THE U.S. COAST GUARD TO 
RESPOND TO OIL SPILL EMERGENCIES WORLDWIDE.  WE SPONSOR MORE MARINE 
MAMMAL RESEARCH THAN ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD, INVESTING 
MORE THAN $100 MILLION OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH 
OTHER AGENCIES, ACADEMIA AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS.  EARLIER 
THIS MONTH WE COMPLETED THE PHASEOUT OF CHLOROFLUOROCARBON (CFC) 
REFRIGERANTS, AN OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCE, ON AIRCRAFT CARRIERS.   ON 
ANOTHER FRONT, NAVY REGION SOUTHWEST'S WATER CONSERVATION EFFORTS 
REDUCED CONSUMPTION 15 PERCENT BETWEEN OCTOBER 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 2008. 
FINALLY, SINCE 2005 THE NAVY HAS SUCCESSFULLY PARTNERED WITH DOD, 
STATES, COUNTIES, ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND LAND TRUSTS TO SECURE 
CONSERVATION EASEMENTS FOR NEARLY 5000 ACRES OF LAND ADJACENT TO NAVY 
BASES.  THESE EASEMENTS NOT ONLY CONSERVE AND PROTECT NATURAL RESOURCES, 
BUT ALSO ENSURE COMPATIBLE USE WITH ON-BASE ACTIVITIES.  NAVY'S NON-DOD 
PARTNERS HAVE CONTRIBUTED $20 MILLION, OR TWO THIRDS, OF THE TOTAL COST 
TO OBTAIN THESE EASEMENETS.
5. ON THIS EARTH DAY, I ENCOURAGE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL EARTH 
DAY EVENTS, AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PROACTIVE DAILY ACTIONS TO PROTECT 
OUR ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS WHILE WE CARRY OUT OUR PRIMARY 
MISSION IN DEFENSE OF THE NATION.
