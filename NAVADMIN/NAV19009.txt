RMKS/1.  It is with great pleasure that I announce the selection of Afloat 
Training Group Middle Pacific as the Fiscal Year 2018 winner of the USS 
BAINBRIDGE (CGN 25) Award for Overall Excellence in Community Service.  Per 
reference (a), this annual award recognizes a Navy command that engaged in 
exemplary voluntary community service activities with local communities.  
Sailors at Afloat Training Group Middle Pacific greatly improved the lives of 
more than 61,000 in their local community through their ongoing relationship 
with local schools, Special Olympics of Hawaii, and numerous local food 
banks.  Their efforts made a positive difference in the lives of Americas 
youth and helped them to reach their fullest potential, specifically in 
education and civic responsibility.

2.  USS GERMANTOWN (LSD 42) was chosen as Honorable Mention for the USS 
BAINBRIDGE (CGN 25) Award for Overall Excellence in Community Service.

up, the Sasebo Shimabara Walk, Department of Defense Schools STEM Programs,
