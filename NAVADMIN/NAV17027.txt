SUBJ/SAILOR ASSISTANCE AND INTERCEPT FOR LIFE UPDATE//

REF/A/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON DC/161901ZSEP16//
AMPN/REF A is NAVADMIN 208/16 Suicide Prevention and Response/Sailor
Assistance and Intercept for Life.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces that the Sailor Assistance and Intercept for 
Life (SAIL) Program is now available Navy-wide at all Fleet and Family 
Support Centers (FFSC).  Reference (a) announced the start of the SAIL 
program in Navy Region Northwest with a phased regional rollout which is now 
complete.  Trained SAIL case managers provide assistance, ongoing risk-
management, care coordination and reintegration assistance for Sailors 
identified with a suicide ideation or suicide attempt while maintaining a 
collaborative approach with healthcare providers and command leadership.  The 
SAIL program is voluntary.

2.  Commanding Officers will ensure that Suicide Prevention Coordinators 
(SPC):
    a.  understand and execute reporting requirements upon notification that 
a Sailor has experienced any suicide related behavior (SRB), to include 
suicide attempt, suicide ideation or self-injurious behavior.
    b.  refer all Sailors who experienced SRBs to the SAIL program.
    c.  are familiar with this NAVADMIN and reference (a).  All SRBs are to 
be submitted for a SAIL referral.
    d.  complete required SAIL training.

3.  Additional guidance for submitting SAIL referrals and completing required 
SPC SAIL training is available at www.suicide.navy.mil.

4.  SAIL is not designed to replace clinical treatment for SRBs. Sailors who 
experience SRBs must be treated according to U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and 
Surgery (BUMED) guidelines.  BUMED is responsible for ensuring that providers 
are aware of the SAIL program and maintain a collaborative relationship with 
FFSC SAIL Case Managers throughout the reintegration of a Sailor.

5.  The point of contact for the SAIL program is CAPT Michael Fisher, N171, 
who can be reached at (901) 874-6635/DSN 882 or via email at 
michael.d.fisher(at)navy.mil.

6.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled 
whichever occurs first.

7.  Released by Vice Admiral R. P. Burke, N1.//
