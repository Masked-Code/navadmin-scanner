SUBJ/CHANGES TO EXPEDITED TRANSFER AND SAFETY TRANSFER POLICIES//

REF/A/DOC/COMNAVPERSCOM/6APR19//

REF/B/DOC/COMNAVPERSCOM/6APR19//

NARR/REF A IS MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1300-1200, SAFETY TRANSFERS.  REF B IS 
MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1300-1205, EXPEDITED TRANSFERS.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the changes to reference (a) and establishes 
reference (b).  The Expedited Transfer Policy has been expanded to include 
Service Members who are victims of crimes covered under the Uniform Code of 
Military Justice, Articles 117a, 120a and 120c.  Overall program 
responsibilities have moved from the Post Selection Board Matters Branch 
(PERS-833) to the Deployability Assessment/Assignment Branch (LIMDU/TDRL) 
(PERS-454).  Commanding officers are directed to use Exhibit 7 of reference 
(b) when an Expedited Transfer Request is received from a Service Member.

2.  A Safety Transfer may be requested when concerns for the safety and the 
well-being of a Service Member and/or their dependents dictate a transfer 
prior to their normal projected rotation date (PRD).  Situations warranting 
consideration for Safety Transfers include, but are not limited to:
    a.  Victims or witnesses of offenses covered under SECNAVINST 5800.11B, 
Victim and Witness Assistance Program
    b.  Family Advocacy Program cases covered under OPNAVINST 1752.2B, Family 
Advocacy Program
    c.  Victims of violent crimes
    d.  Instances in which threats have been made against a Service Member, 
military spouse or dependents of the Service Member

3.  An expedited transfer is a temporary reassignment within or outside a 
unit or a permanent change of station from the command of the Service Member 
prior to their normal PRD.  This may be requested by a Service Member if:
    a.  The Service Member was a victim of sexual assault and has filed an 
unrestricted report of sexual assault
    b.  The Service Member was a victim of stalking (Article 120a/130), other 
sexual misconduct (Article 120c) or wrongful broadcast or distribution of 
intimate visual images (Article 117a) and has filed a report with a Military 
Criminal Investigation Organization.  The intent behind the expedited 
transfers policy is to assist in the recovery of the Service Member by moving 
him or her to a new location if requested.  Service Members are directed to 
use Exhibit 2 of reference (b) when requesting an expedited transfer.

4.  Points of contact for all correspondence related to safety and expedited 
transfers (requests, approvals, denials or withdrawals) must be forwarded to 
PERS-454 at 901-874-2927/DSN 882, fax at
901-874-2696 or via e-mail at expd_trf.fct(at)navy.mil.
