RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supports references (a) through (c) and announces the 
assignment optimization plan for Active Component (AC) and Training and 
Administration of Reserve (TAR) chief, senior chief and master chief petty 
officers (CPO, SCPO and MCPO respectively).
Commander, Navy Personnel Command (COMNAVPERSCOM), Enlisted Assignment 
Division (PERS-40) will work with the Fleet readiness integrators (FRI), type 
commanders (TYCOM) and budget submitting office (BSO) N1 staffs to evaluate 
all chiefs assigned to billets with incorrect paygrades or those who are not 
aligned to funded billet requirements.  The goal of this optimization plan is 
to ensure our most experienced enlisted Sailors are aligned to billets which 
specifically need their training, leadership and experience.
This plan will lead to the realignment of chiefs into billets appropriate to 
their skills and experience.

2.  COMNAVPERSCOM will host two virtual senior enlisted manning summits in 
Millington, TN.  Participants may attend in person (Fleet, FRI, TYCOM and BSO 
participants will be given seating priority) or by dial-in teleconference, 
with dial-in information distributed separately.  The SCPO and MCPO summit 
will be 25-29 July 2022.  The CPO summit is scheduled 24-28 October 2022, 
contingent on release of selection board results.  In-person groups 
supporting the summits will be governed by the applicable health protection 
condition restrictions, see local guidance for specifics.  During 
registration for the summits, attendees have and will be provided with 
specific risk mitigation instructions.  The summits will allow Fleets, TYCOMs 
and BSOs to work with COMNAVPERSCOM to fill their most critical gapped 
billets.
    a.  Enlisted Readiness and Placement Branch (PERS-4013) have provided a 
list of misaligned chiefs to the FRIs.  The FRIs have distributed the list of 
misaligned Sailors to the TYCOM and BSO N1s.
Prior to the summit, PERS-4013 will evaluate chief billet requirements in 
MyNavy Assignment (MNA).
    b.  Chiefs who are aligned to billets of an incorrect paygrade may be 
subject to the following options:
        (1) Realignment to an in-paygrade requirement at their current 
command.
        (2) Movement to a valid billet at another command.
        (3) If immediate alignment to a valid in-grade billet is not 
reasonably possible, then adjustment of projected rotation date
(PRD) to enter the order negotiation window earlier than their current PRD.  
Chiefs in receipt of a PRD adjustment should expect to negotiate for orders 
to fill an in-paygrade requirement and will be considered a sea or shore 
roller based on a ratio of sea and shore duty billets available within their 
paygrade.
    c.  Enlisted manning stakeholders identified in paragraph 1 shall review 
misaligned personnel, as well as Fleet billet vacancies and provide their 
recommendations for consideration at the manning Summit.
    d.  Fleet readiness concerns will guide all decisions and actions, but 
each move will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
    e.  The movement of realigned personnel will begin approximately
30 days after each summit concludes.  Any out-of-area moves will receive 
adequate time to prepare and execute.  All transfer timelines will take into 
account the vacancies that they will create and those they will fill, and 
limit or prevent *double-stuffing* of billets.
    f.  CPO optimization efforts will not include nuclear chiefs, nuclear 
billet structures, or nuclear enlisted manning stakeholders.

3.  The summit precept requires participants to evaluate all Sailors without 
prejudice or partiality.  Each participant must pay particular attention to 
each Sailor and billet to ensure that they are meeting the intention of the 
optimization process.  During deliberations, participants may consider any 
negative impacts a realignment may have on the activity or the Sailor.  
Before any decisions are made, TYCOM/BSO and FRIs will provide their input.  
If the requested actions are within one FRI, the FRI will make final 
decisions.  If the requested action involves more than one FRI and there is a 
disagreement, the manning control authority will make the final decision.  A 
copy of the precept will be provided to participants by the summit 
coordinators.

4.  Fleet activities shall continue evaluating MNA alignments to ensure that 
Sailors are accurately aligned aboard their current activity.  Chiefs should 
be aligned to billets for their specific paygrades.  If Sailors of any 
paygrade need to be realigned to another billet, the activity manning manager 
(AMM) should submit a member realignment request (MRR) in MNA.  If the MRR is 
approved, PERS-4013 will update the alignment.  AMMs should contact their 
placement coordinator in PERS-4013 with any questions or concerns.

5.  Key messages:
    a.  Sailors.  We are working to better align our enlisted supervisors to 
billets which require their skills and experience.
The emphasis on operational readiness and unit prioritization reflect our 
identity as a sea service.  We must preserve the readiness of the Fleet and 
ensure that chiefs are optimally assigned to meet mission readiness.  We will 
take each Sailors personal considerations into account.
    b.  Commands.  Commanders, commanding officers, executive officers and 
command master chiefs must ensure their Sailors understand the intent of this 
message.  Your cooperation and support of this senior enlisted optimization 
will greatly contribute to achieving maximum Fleet and operational readiness.
