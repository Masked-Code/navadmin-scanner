congressional seats and for governorships. Electing our leaders through open 
elections makes democracy unique and is a freedom that we defend. Everyone is 
encouraged to exercise their right to vote and to ensure that their voice is 
heard.

relies upon leadership support at every level of the chain of command. The 
following guidance is provided:

or more individuals is required to maintain a voting assistance program, 
managed by a command Voting Assistance Officer (VOA).

Reference (a) is under revision and will reflect changes made in reference

followed whenever the two differ. 
(2) VAOs are required to maintain a current Voting Information Management 
System (VIMS) account. Account information should be updated at least 
quarterly at https://qol.navyaims.net/voting/.

4. Voting action plan outlines specific milestones in support of the 2014 
election and may be found at http://www.fvap.gov/vao/guidance/html. Any voter
