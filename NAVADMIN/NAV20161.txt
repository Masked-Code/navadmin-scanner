RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces solicitation of applications from highly 
qualified and motivated E-6 through E-9 Active-Duty and Full- Time Support 
personnel for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 Limited Duty Officer (LDO) and Chief 
Warrant Officer (CWO) programs.  Where conflicts with reference (a) exist, 
this NAVADMIN takes precedence.

2.  For the most current information concerning open designator codes, visit 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-
planning/commissioning-programs, click the *Active-Duty LDO/CWO In- Service 
Procurement Board* link, then select the current LDO and CWO designators 
link.

3.  Eligibility.  All applicants for the LDO and CWO programs must be able to 
complete sea duty screening and be worldwide assignable.
Updated policy guidance to reference (a):
    a.  All time-in-service (TIS) and time-in-grade (TIG) requirements for 
the FY-22 Active-Duty LDO and CWO In-Service Procurement Board (ISPB) will be 
computed to 1 October 2021.
    b.  To support career progression models and maximize the return on 
investment for the Navy, TIS waivers for LDO and CWO applications will not be 
considered.
        (1) LDO obligatory service is 4 years from commissioning.
        (2) CWO obligatory service is 6 years from commissioning.
    c.  TIS and TIG requirements are:
        (1) LDO:  8-14 years TIS and 1 year TIG for E-6 and above.
        (2) Applicants for LDO off-ramp designators (629X, 651X, 681X and 
682X) may apply with up to 15 years of service and must comprehend designator 
specific off-ramp requirements and procedures defined in references (b) 
through (d).
        (3) Nuclear Power LDO (620X) applicants may apply with up to
16 years of service.
        (4) CWO3:  14 to 22 years TIS and 1 day TIG as an E-9 as of board 
convening date.
        (5) CWO2:  14 to 20 years TIS for E-6 selected for E-7, E-7 and E-8

        (6) WO1 (784X only):  6 to 12 years TIS for E-5 and above.
Cyber Warrant Officer WO1 (784X) applicants refer to eligibility requirements 
listed in reference (e).
    d.  Intelligence CWO (783X) applicants will be considered for selection 
into one of three Core Competency Areas (CCA):  CI/HUMINT, GEOINT/Targeting 
or OPINTEL.  In order to apply, applicants must request a primary CCA and 
those holding qualifying NECs in more than one field may request a secondary 
CCA (i.e., 783X CI/HUMINT / 783X OPINTEL).
    e.  First class petty officers serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Horn 
of Africa determined to be chief petty officer board eligible in line with 
reference (f) are also eligible for LDO if all other eligibility requirements 
are met.
    f.  Due to ongoing rating mergers or realignments, eligible Sailors are 
encouraged to apply for the designator for which they have extensive 
documented technical and leadership experience in their enlisted service 
records, regardless of current rating.
However, special attention should be given to the guidance in chapter 7, 
subparagraph 9c of reference (a).
    g.  Applicants must maintain eligibility throughout the selection and 
promotion process.  Applicants who are deemed ineligible after submitting an 
application must be declared ineligible by their current Commanding

the form (See Sample Letter of Abeyance or Removal of Recommendation).  
Nuclear Power LDO (620X) applicants who are deemed ineligible must be 
declared ineligible by their current CO via letter to the Nuclear Program 
Manager (OPNAV N133).

4.  Appraisal Boards.  (Not required for Nuclear Power LDO 620X) Interview 
appraisal boards must be assembled and approved by the CO/OIC and consist of 
three Active Duty Naval Officers (LDO or CWOs preferred).

each applicant (Not required for Nuclear Power LDO 620X).

package due on 1 October 2020 in lieu of the Service Member, provided that

provided a copy of their entire package prior to sending.  Information 
received that is not under the cover letter of the applicant (e.g., third

Career Center (MNCC) by the established deadline(s) will not be presented to 
the board.
    a.  All applications must be submitted along with a command screened

clearly identify the command, must be signed by the CO or OIC and include the 
CO or OICs command point of contact information.
    d.  Applicants must ensure a copy of their most recent periodic
