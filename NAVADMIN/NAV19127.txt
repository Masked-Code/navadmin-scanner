RMKS/1.  2019 marks the 58th year for the Annual Interservice Rifle 
Championship and the 60th year for the Annual Interservice Pistol 
Championship.  These events represent long-standing tradition of competition 
in arms between the services, dating back to 1960 when the Chief of Naval 
Operations, Commandant of the Marine Corps, Chief of Staff of the Army, and 
Chief of Staff of the Air Force signed a memorandum of understanding to 
create and ensure the continuation of interservice marksmanship competitions.  
The Service Chiefs recognized the importance of joint competitive 
marksmanship competitions to maintain vital camaraderie between the services 
during periods of peace and conflict.

2.  The 58th Annual Fleet and All Navy Rifle and Pistol Championships were 
conducted, for the west coast at Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, CA and 
for the east coast at Marine Corps Base, Quantico, VA.  Matches were 
conducted per references (c), (d), and (e) and concluded with the 
identification of the top 20 Navy active and reserve rifle competitors and 
the top 20 active and reserve pistol competitors.  These top performers 
comprise the 2019 team to represent the U. S. Navy at interservice and 
national competitions.
Well done to the Navy's best rifle and pistol marksmen!
