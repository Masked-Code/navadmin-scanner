SUBJ/FAMILYGRAM 01-12 - YOUR BENEFITS AND THE DEFENSE ENROLLMENT 
ELIGIBILITY REPORTING SYSTEM (DEERS)//

RMKS/1.  AS A MEMBER OF THE NAVY FAMILY, YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MANY 
BENEFITS.  PROPER REGISTRATION IN THE DEFENSE ENROLLMENT ELIGIBILITY 
SYSTEM (DEERS) IS KEY TO RECEIVING AN ID CARD AND ELIGIBILITY FOR DOD 
SPONSORED BENEFITS SUCH AS TRICARE, MEDICAL, AND DENTAL SERVICES.  AS 
CHANGES OCCUR, INFORMATION MUST BE UPDATED. 

2.  IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER ABOUT DEERS:
    A.  SERVICE MEMBERS ARE AUTOMATICALLY ENROLLED.
    B.  A SERVICE MEMBER'S ENROLLMENT IN DEERS DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY 
ENROLL DEPENDENTS.  ENROLLMENT OF SPOUSES, CHILDREN AND OTHER 
QUALIFIED DEPENDENTS MUST BE MADE BY THE MEMBER AT A REAL-TIME 
AUTOMATED PERSONNEL IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM (RAPIDS) (ID-CARD) SITE.
    C.  CHANGING THE RECORD OF EMERGENCY DATA OR DEPENDENCY 
APPLICATION (PAGE 2) DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE DEERS STATUS.  
THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE DATA SYSTEMS.  
    D.  DEERS SHOULD BE UPDATED WHENEVER YOU EXPERIENCE A LIFE 
CHANGING EVENT.  EXAMPLES OF A LIFE CHANGING EVENT INCLUDE:  GETTING 
MARRIED OR DIVORCED, HAVING A BABY OR ADOPTING A CHILD, CHILD TURNS 21, 
MOVING TO A NEW ADDRESS, ETC.
    E.  FAILURE TO UPDATE DEERS WITHIN 30 DAYS OF ANY LIFE CHANGING 
EVENT COULD RESULT IN TEMPORARY LOSS OF BENEFITS ELIGIBILITY FOR FAMILY 
MEMBERS.  SOME COMMMON CONCERNS ARE:
        (1) IF YOUR DEERS INFORMATION IS INCORRECT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE 
TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AT A MILITARY TREATMENT FACILITY (MTF), OBTAIN 
MEDICAL SERVICE AT A CIVILIAN FACILITY THROUGH TRICARE, MEDICAL CLAIMS 
MAY BE DENIED, AND/OR YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES;
        (2) CIVILIAN RETAIL PHARMACIES CHECK DEERS TO VERIFY TRICARE 
ELIGIBILITY AND YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS WILL BE FILLED ONLY IF YOU ARE 
ENROLLED IN DEERS; AND
        (3) INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR BENEFITS, INCLUDING TRICARE, IS 
MAILED TO THE ADDRESS IN DEERS.
