2.  APPLICANTS ARE SELECTED BASED ON THE SNAPSHOT OF QUOTAS OUT AND 
QUOTAS IN BY YG AND BY COMMUNITY.  NOT BEING SELECTED IS NOT REASON TO 
GIVE UP HOPE FOR REALIZING YOUR DREAM.  APPLY AGAIN (AND AGAIN AS 
REQUIRED), ALL THE WHILE BOLSTERING YOUR PACKAGE BY SUSTAINED SUPERIOR 
PERFORMANCE AND INITIATIVE INTO YOUR DESIRED COMMUNITY.  WHAT MAKES 
YOUR RECORD STANDOUT IS MOTIVATION TOWARDS YOUR GAINING COMMUNITY AS 
WELL AS CONTINUED PROMOTABILITY.  A RECORD OF AVERAGE PERFORMANCE CAN 
BE SIGNIFICANTLY BOLSTERED FOR THE BOARD BY LETTERS FROM YOU, PAST CO'S, 
CURRENT CO'S AND GAINING COMMUNITY SENIOR LEADERSHIP.

3.  FOR JUNIOR YEAR GROUPS (03 THROUGH 06), THE DEMAND SIGNAL FAR 
EXCEEDED THE SUPPLY SIGNAL.  MANY QUALITY APPLICANTS WERE IDENTIFIED BY 
THE BOARD BUT COULD NOT UTLIMATELY BE SELECTED DUE TO CONSTRAINTS OF 
EITHER OUTGOING COMMUNITY OR GAINING COMMUNITY.  THE QUOTAS ARE RE-
DETERMINED EVERY 6 MONTHS, SO RE-APPLY EACH TIME IN ORDER TO STAY IN 
THE HUNT.

4.  AS ALWAYS, COMPETITION FOR REDESIGNATION WAS KEEN, AND EVERY 
COMMUNITY HAD A POOL OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES TO SELECT FROM.
ELIGIBLE OFFICERS NOT INITIALLY SELECTED FOR THEIR PRIMARY OR SECONDARY 
CHOICE WERE SUBSEQUENTLY REVIEWED BY ALL OTHER COMMUNITIES FOR 
CONSIDERATION.  THOSE OFFICERS TENTATIVELY SELECTED FOR COMMUNITIES NOT 
INITIALLY REQUESTED WILL BE NOTIFIED VIA OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE AND 
OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDESIGNATE.

5.  PROCESS IS VERY THOROUGH.  BOARD MEMBERS ARE FOCUSED ON THEIR TASK 
- PICKING THE RIGHT OFFICERS - FULLY AND BEST QUALIFIED FROM AVAILABLE 
APPLICANTS.  RECORDS RECEIVE A DETAILED SCRUB AND THERE IS THOUGHTFUL 
AND DELIBERATE DISCUSSIONS ON EACH APPLICANT.  

6.  THIS MSG IS NOT AUTHORITY TO DELIVER CHANGE OF DESIGNATOR LETTER TO 
THE SELECTEE.
    A.  OFFICERS WHO ARE PROMOTION SELECTEES SHOULD CONTACT THEIR 
CURRENT DETAILER TO DISCUSS REDESIGNATION TIMING.  COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-
802), UPON NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) THAT THE SELECTEE HAS 
BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO THEIR NEW COMMUNITY, WILL FORWARD A 
REDESIGNATION LTR TO THE SELECTEE OR APPOINTMENT ACCEPTANCE AND OATH OF 
OFFICE (NAVPERS 1000/4), AS APPLICABLE.
    B.  OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT PROMOTION SELECTEES AND WHO ARE NOT UNDER 
ORDERS CAN EXPECT ASSIGNMENT TO A NEW BILLET APPROPRIATE TO THEIR NEW 
DESIGNATION WHEN NOTIFIED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4).
    C.  IF A MEMBER IS CURRENTLY UNDER ORDERS AND TRANSFERS PRIOR TO 
NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4), MEMBER MUST EXECUTE ORDERS 
UNDER CURRENT DESIGNATOR AND MUST COMPLETE 12 MONTHS AT THE NEW 
ASSIGNMENT, UNLESS A SHORTER TOUR IS PRESCRIBED (TOURS IN EXCESS OF ONE 
YEAR WILL BE WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE GAINING COMMUNITY), PRIOR TO 
REDESIGNATION.

7.  THE FOLLOWING ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE ABOVE:
    A.  SURFACE WARFARE (11XX) OFFICERS WHO ARE UNDER ORDERS TO 
DEPARTMENT HEAD SCHOOL MAY NOT LATERALLY TRANSFER UNTIL COMPLETION OF 
INITIAL DEPARTMENT HEAD TOUR.  ADDITIONALLY, THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS ARE 
NOT ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR LATERAL TRANSFER/ REDESIGNATION UNTIL WITHIN
1 YEAR OF SATISFYING THEIR RESPECTIVE OBLIGATION:
        - OFFICERS WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR SURFACE WARFARE OFFICER 
CONTINUATION PAY (SWOCP).
        - OFFICERS WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR JUNIOR SURFACE WARFARE OFFICER 
CRITICAL SKILLS BONUS (JR SWO CSRB).
        - OFFICERS OBLIGATED TO COMPLETE DEPARTMENT HEAD ASSIGNMENTS 
DUE TO SELECTION FOR DIVISION OFFICER SEQUENCE PLAN-B OR A SWOCP 
OBLIGATED SHORE TOUR.
        - OFFICERS WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR A SURFACE WARFARE OFFICER 
CRITICAL SKILLS (SWOCS) BONUS.
    B.  AVIATION OFFICERS SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED TO LATERAL TRANSFER 
UNTIL COMPLETION OF ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE OBLIGATION, EXPIRATION OF 
AVIATION CAREER CONTINUATION PAY CONTRACT, OR PLANNED ROTATION DATE, 
WHICHEVER IS LATER.
    C.  ANY APPLICANT FOR 1510 WHO IS PRESENTLY DESIGNATED 131X OR 132X 
AND IS ELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION BEFORE THE BOARD MAY BE REDESIGNATED 
1510 IN ACCORDANCE WITH MILPERSMAN 1212-010, IF SELECTED.  HOWEVER, IF 
A SECOND SEA TOUR OR AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD TOUR HAS NOT BEEN 
COMPLETED, ASSIGNMENT TO 1510 BILLETS MAY BE DELAYED UNTIL THE 
COMPLETION OF APPLICABLE SECOND SEA AND/OR AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD 
TOUR, AS DETERMINED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-43).

8.  COMMANDING OFFICER SHALL:
    A.  ENSURE OFFICERS SELECTED FOR PROMOTION WITHIN THEIR CURRENT 
COMMUNITY DO NOT ACCEPT REDESIGNATION BEFORE THEIR PROMOTION DATE.
    B.  NOTIFY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-803) WITHIN 30 DAYS OF RELEASE OF 
THIS MESSAGE OF SELECTEES WHO DO NOT DESIRE TO ACCEPT TRANSFER/ 
REDESIGNATION.

9.  THE NEXT TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION BOARD WILL BE HELD IN NOVEMBER 2008. 
APPLICATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 8 SEPTEMBER 2008.  NON-SELECTEES FROM 
PAST BOARDS MUST SUBMIT A NEW APPLICATION FOR CONSIDERATION. OPNAVINST 
1210.5 AND MILPERSMAN ARTICLES 1212-010 AND 1212-030 SHOULD BE REVIEWED 
FOR ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION PROCEDURES. OFFICIAL 
TRANSCRIPTS AND MOST RECENT FITREP ARE REQUIRED AS PART OF APPLICATION 
PACKAGES.
