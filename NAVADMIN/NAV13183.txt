PROGRAM.//

Rmks/1.  This Navadmin reiterates the importance and positive impact of Coalition of Sailors Against 
Destructive Decisions (CSADD) chapters, peer to peer mentoring and bystander intervention.  Since 
CSADD's inception in 2007, there are now over 300 chapters throughout the Navy.  CSADD Sailors are 
taking on leadership challenges both on and off-duty, reinforcing the principles of CSADD and Navy's 
core values.

2.  Members of CSADD chapters are constantly innovating using social networking, visual aids, live 
performances and other communication tools, to communicate with their peer group about the impacts 
of destructive behavior and the benefits of better decision making.
This Shipmates helping Shipmates initiative accentuates the Navy's messages of Keep What You've 
Earned, and those supporting sexual assault prevention, sexual harassment prevention, suicide 
prevention and total fitness.

3.  The history of our Navy shows that fellow shipmates have the greatest influence in mentoring our 
next generation of leaders.  Bystander intervention is a powerful and effective method to preserve lives, 
careers, and the safety of our force.

4.  Led by the Secretary of Defense, Navy leadership recognizes the importance of peer to peer 
organizations.  We are committed to empowering commanders, commanding officers and senior 
enlisted leadership as they sponsor and encourage the continued positive work of CSADD.  The informal 
support from the Chief's Mess and First Class Petty Officer Association to aid their local CSADD chapters 
is recognized and well received.

5.  Additional details on CSADD, including how to establish a local CSADD chapter, can be found on the 
CSADD website at http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/support/csadd/pages/default2.aspx.
General questions and comments regarding CSADD should be addressed to the OPNAV N17 point of 
contact, Ms. Amanda Alston, at (901) 874-6723 or via e-mail at amanda.alston(at)navy.mil.

6.  Bravo Zulu for your mentoring and keep charging!
