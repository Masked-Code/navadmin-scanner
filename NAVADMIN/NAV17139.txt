RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides approved direction originating from the 
Civilian Advisory Board (CAB) that convened in April 2017 and is applicable 
to commands at which Navy civilian employees are assigned.  As part of the 
duties prescribed in reference (a), the CAB categorized their priorities 
under four goals, as noted in reference (b), the Navy Civilian Workforce 
Framework:
    a.  integrated military-civilian team,
    b.  training and education,
    c.  career progression and
    d.  governance.

2.  OCONUS Waivers.  The existing policy delegating authority for overseas 
tour extensions for Department of the Navy civilian employees will be further 
amended beyond the delegation in reference (c).  In line with reference (d), 
effective immediately, Echelon II Budget Submitting Office (BSO) commanders 
(flag officer/senior civilian equivalent) may approve overseas tour 
extensions in excess of 9 years for civilian employees in foreign areas.  
This authority may not be further delegated.  BSO commanders will remain 
responsible for ensuring workforce succession plans and robust recruitment 
efforts.

3.  Employee Recognition.  Similar to military ceremonies, civilian promotion 
ceremonies are highly encouraged and should be performed when an employee is 
increased in grade and include restatements of the oath of office as a 
rededication to the values contained within. Similarly, civilian recognition 
and award ceremonies showcase those employees who model behaviors we want to 
instill in the entire workforce.

4.  Mandatory Training.  NAVADMIN 072/17 eliminated the requirement to use 
Navy e-Learning, accessible through My Navy Portal and formerly accessed 
through Navy Knowledge Online for mandatory training for military members.  
This NAVADMIN extends NAVADMIN 072/17 to include all Navy civilian employees.  
Civilian government employees will no longer be required to log onto Navy 
e-Learning or Total Workforce Management Services to complete mandatory 
annual training.  The commanding officer(s) (CO) and each level of leadership 
shall seek to conduct mandatory and required training at small face-to-face 
training sessions, with appropriate leaders engaging employees in group sizes 
small enough to allow meaningful discussion on the subjects.  All mandatory 
training developed and delivered must be in compliance with reference (e).  
All instances of completed civilian training must be recorded in the Defense
Civilian Personnel Data System via MyBiz within 30 days of completion.
    a.  Cyber Awareness Challenge V4 and its successive versions will remain 
as the only on-line training requirement.  All other training topics may be 
completed via any delivery method determined acceptable by local commands.
    b.  Mandated supervisory training, in line with reference (f), shall be 
tracked by each command and completion reported to their Echelon II command.
    c.  Existing training materials will remain on existing portals and 
e-Learning sites to provide an outline to commands for the conduct of small 
face-to-face, leader-led training.  There is no intent for commands to re-
create training lesson plans.

5.  Civilian Training Advocates.  Each Echelon II command will identify a 
civilian training advocate to focus on civilian training and education and to 
advise local commanders on equitable opportunities for civilian employee 
development.  This advocate will work closely with the Navy Civilian 
Workforce Office (OPNAV N1C), command Directors of Human Resources, and the 
Office of Civilian Human Resources to ensure a high level of visibility and 
value is placed on civilian workforce training.

6.  Coaching and Mentoring.  Civilian employees should receive timely and 
constructive feedback by their supervisor on their wins as well as their 
setbacks to ensure proper professional growth and focus on performance.  
Employee participation in a mentoring program, whether formal or informal, is 
strongly encouraged as the feedback gained by individuals outside of their 
supervisory chain can be invaluable in the development process.

7.  Echelon II commanders and region commanders should ensure widest 
dissemination to all subordinate, tenant commands, and detachments for action 
as required.  All COs and officers-in-charge should ensure timely status of 
their implementation of these initiatives to their immediate supervisors or 
up-Echelon commander.

8.  Working groups have been established and are developing recommendations 
for a standardized Navy Civilian Leader Development Program as well as a Navy 
Civilian Acculturation Program for those new to the Navy team.  We expect 
these to report out to the CAB in early August.

9.  Point of contact is Ms. Anne Davis, OPNAV N1C, who can be reached at 
(703) 604-2682/DSN 664 or via e-mail at anne.davis(at)navy.mil.

10. This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or cancelled, 
whichever occurs first.
