obligated service from 12 to 36 months for those who wish to separate from 
Active Duty in lieu of forced conversion.  As outlined in reference (b), 
requests must contain a statement of understanding that any unearned bonuses 
will be recouped and separation pay will not be authorized.  Separations 
must occur no later than 30 September 2021.

Distribution Assignment Branch (PERS-40), are authorized to approve such 
requests barring any negative impacts to sea duty.  Each request will be 
reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  Any request that would negatively impact 
sea duty manning will be disapproved. 
 
4.  Navy remains committed to ensuring Fleet readiness by providing 
well-trained Sailors in the right paygrade with the right skills and 
experience at the right time.
