RMKS/1. This NAVADMIN announces the Navy and Marine Corps Air Traffic Control 
(ATC) Leadership Continuum to be held in Kansas City, MO from 30 April to 2 
May 2019.  This event, originally scheduled in September 2018, was postponed

encroachment, and authority; Naval Air Systems Command Program Manager Air 
update on equipment and budgets; Navy and Marine Corps manning and manpower;

of the National Airspace System; and United States Navy/United States Marine
