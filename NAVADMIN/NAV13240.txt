SUBJ/RECOGNIZING THE 238TH U.S. NAVY BIRTHDAY// 

1. 13 October 2013 will mark the U.S. Navy's 238th birthday. Beginning with 
the establishment of our Navy in 1775 and continuing to our current Fleet, 
the Navy has stood the watch for more than two centuries. This message 
provides information along with recommendations to support Navy wide efforts 
to recognize and commemorate this year's birthday. This year's theme for the 
U.S. Navy birthday is Defending America with Pride Since 1775.

2. The week-long commemoration will take place from 7-13 October. The goals 
of this celebration are to honor our shipmates who stand and have stood the 
watch, showcase our Navy's history and heritage, as well as instill a sense 
of pride in our sailors and the American public.

3. Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC) will serve to support commands' 
commemoration efforts.
 
A. The Navy Birthday Working Group was established to support
Fleet-wide planning to make birthday commemorations as meaningful and 
economical as possible. USFF, CPF, OPNAV, CNIC, CNRF, CHINFO, NETC, 
CNATRA, BUMED, ONR, NAVSPECWAR and CNRC are currently invited members, 
and local commands may join by contacting NHHC POC listed below.
 
B. NHHC is developing a tool kit that will be available online.
       The following content is accessible from NHHC:
       1. Plan of the Day historical notes for the week of Navy birthday
       (which will also be posted in the Plan of the Day section on the
       Navy's website at http://www.navy.mil/planOfDay.asp ).
       2. Navy Ball template.
       3. History stand down lesson plans.
       4. Template for Navy birthday bell ringing ceremony.

       C. NHHC is working with CHINFO and Defense Media Activity on media
       materials for use at local and regional commemorative efforts.
 
D. Commemorative Events. The following list of events are
       recommended for consideration as operational commitments and
       fiscal guidance permit:
       1. Bell-ringing ceremony - visit the NHHC website for specific
       details.

E. Social Media. In order to track the online worldwide conversation
       about the Navy's birthday, request commands use the hashtag
       #USNavyBday in all birthday related social media efforts. Use of this
       hashtag will allow for an easy search and to follow the conversation.
 
F. At the end of this year's effort, NHHC will solicit and compile
       "lessons learned" to improve on next year's commemoration from
       working group members.
