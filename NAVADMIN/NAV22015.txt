RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the Spring Fiscal Year 2022 
(FY-22) Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) (Previously Full-
Time Support) Officer Transfer and Redesignation Board on 25 April 
2022.  Applications from qualified Active Component (AC) and Selected Reserve 
(SELRES) officers will be considered by this board.  In line with reference 
(a), this board will also accept applications from TAR officers requesting 
redesignation into another TAR officer community. 
 
2.  Applicants can find requirements and procedures via the MyNavy HR Site 
at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Officer/Reserve-OCM/Full-Time-Support/FTS-Redesignation/.   
Complete applications with associated enclosures and the applicant 
information document must be received no later than 2359 Central Standard 
Time on 2 March 2022. 
 
3.  Eligibility 
    a.  All applicants must meet eligibility requirements outlined in 
reference (a), the Spring FY-22 TAR eligibility criteria document and the 
following: 
        (1) Projected Rotation Date (PRD).  Applicants should have a PRD no 
later than 31 October 2023.  Waiver requests will need to be endorsed by your 
commanding officer on the command endorsement. 
        (2) Minimum Service Requirement (MSR).  AC applicants should have 
completed their MSR prior to 31 October 2023.  Waiver requests (no additional 
documentation required by the applicant) will be considered on a case-by-case 
basis by your AC Officer Community Manager (OCM). 
        (3) Year Group.  All AC applicants are subject to AC OCM manning 
needs.  All applicants are subject to TAR OCM manning needs. 
No action is required by the applicants. 
        (4) Aviation Bonus (AvB).  Aviation officers with obligated service 
as a result of AvB are eligible to apply if the officer will be within 12 
months of completing AvB obligation or department head tour at the time the 
board convenes.  Redesignation immediately following a department head tour 
may result in cancellation of AvB, which will be adjudicated by Aviation 
Officer Assignments (PERS-43). 
        (5) Failure of Selection (FOS).  AC officers in a 2xFOS status for 
promotion to O4 are eligible to apply for TAR regardless of MSR and AvB 
contract term.  A waiver request is not required. Reserve Component (RC) 
officers in a 1xFOS status are considered on a case-by-case basis.  RC 
officers with two or more FOS are not eligible. 
    b.  All AC applications will be routed by the TAR OCM through the 
applicable AC OCM for community release prior to applications being sent to 
the board.  Applicants who are not released by the AC OCM will not be 
eligible for the board.  AC officers with a resignation submitted in Navy 
Standard Integrated Personnel System and in routing at Navy Personnel Command 
and O3s in a 2xFOS status are eligible to apply and do not require AC OCM 
release. 
    c.  Limited Duty Officers who possess a 4-year baccalaureate degree are 
eligible for the TAR program. 
 
4.  Officers applying for multiple aviation platforms will be selected based 
on qualifications and Navy mission requirements. 
 
5.  AC officers will incur a minimum 2-year TAR obligation if selected.  In 
line with references (b) and (c), aviators selected for the Fleet Logistics 
Support community will incur a 3-year TAR obligation.  All SELRES officers 
will incur a 3-year TAR obligation regardless of community.  All TAR 
obligations will begin on the date a Service Member redesignates as a TAR 
officer, unless otherwise stated in reference (c). 
 
6.  Upon approval of the board proceedings, the results of the board will be 
posted on the TAR redesignation board website.  Applicants can expect to see 
the results posted within 30 days of board adjournment.  Within 2 weeks of 
the board results being posted, selectees will receive an acceptance package 
and will have 10 days upon receipt to accept or decline TAR 
transfer/redesignation. 
 
7.  Points of contact are LCDR A. J. Edwards, Director of Affiliation and 
Redesignation (PERS-92) at (901) 874-4512/DSN 882 or via email at
