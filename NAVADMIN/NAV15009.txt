RMKS/1.  Per reference (a), this NAVADMIN establishes the Chief of Chaplains 
as program sponsor for the professional development of Chaplain Corps (CHC) 
officers and enlisted Religious Program Specialists (RP).  The Chief of 
Chaplains conducts annual short-course training for CHC officers and RPs to 
update essential techniques and practices in military ministry.  This 
training enables chaplains to obtain continuing education units which may be 
required to maintain their credentials with their religious organizations.

2.  The FY-15 Professional Development Training will consist of a total of 
four days.  The first day (Monday) is a Professional Development Training 
Workshop (PDTW) focusing on *Professional Naval Chaplaincy.*  Per reference 
(b), the workshop will enhance the capability and competencies of chaplains 
and RPs to meet professional standards, develop leadership, and build 
community.

3.  The next three days (Tuesday-Thursday) the Professional Development 
Training Course (PDTC) will address "Pastoral Care in Suicide Prevention, 
Intervention, and Postvention."  It is a mission essential training 
requirement for chaplains and RPs.  It will enable chaplains and RPs to 
provide effective religious ministry to those involved in circumstances of 
suicide prevention, intervention, and postvention and to provide relevant 
advice to commanders as required by references (a) and (c).

4.  In addition to pastoral care competencies, the course includes an 
overview of psychological insights into suicide and suicidology and an 
effective multi-level approach to suicide prevention programs to include 
building resilience, reducing stigma, and reinforcing hope.  The course will 
provide training in an evidence-based risk assessment and safety plan, as 
well as interdisciplinary partnering with behavioral health professionals and 
community services providers.  Chaplains and RPs will also discuss 
postvention pastoral care best practices which include:  after care for 
family, friends, and unit members; command advisement; and memorial 
ceremonies.
