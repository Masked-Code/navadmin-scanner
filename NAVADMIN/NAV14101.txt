FY-15 SEAMAN TO ADMIRAL-21 (STA-21) COMMISSIONING PROGRAM.

2.  STA-21 IS A FULL-TIME UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION AND COMMISSIONING PROGRAM 
OPEN TO ENLISTED PERSONNEL OF ALL PAYGRADES AND RATINGS WHO MEET THE 
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIED IN REF (A).

3.  DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF APPLICATIONS FOR THE FY-15 STA-21 PROGRAM IS  
1 JULY 2014.  APPLICATION PACKAGES MUST BE POSTMARKED ON OR BEFORE THE 
DEADLINE DATE.  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT APPLICATIONS BE MAILED PRIOR TO THE 
DEADLINE AS EARLY SUBMISSION IS BETTER AND ALLOWS TIMELY FEEDBACK TO THE 
SAILOR FOR SUBMISSION OF MISSING OR ILLEGIBLE DOCUMENTS.  DEADLINE FOR 
SUBMISSION OF ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION TO AN APPLICANT'S PACKAGE IS 1 AUGUST 
2014.  NO ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS CAN BE ADDED AFTER THIS DATE.  THE SELECTION 
BOARD IS SCHEDULED TO CONVENE IN SEPTEMBER 2014 AND THE SELECTEES WILL BE 
ANNOUNCED VIA NAVADMIN.

4.  THE FOLLOWING TARGET OPTIONS AND CORE ARE OPEN FOR APPLICATION FOR THE 
FY-15 SELECTION BOARD:  SURFACE WARFARE (SWO), SURFACE WARFARE/INFORMATION 
PROFESSIONAL (SWO/IP), SURFACE WARFARE/ OCEANOGRAPHY (SWO/OCEANO), NUCLEAR, 
SPECIAL WARFARE (SEAL), EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE DISPOSAL (EOD), NAVAL FLIGHT 
OFFICER (NFO), PILOT, CIVIL ENGINEERING CORPS (CEC), AND NURSE CORPS.

FY-15:  HUMAN RESOURCES (HR), INTELLIGENCE, INFORMATION WARFARE, MEDICAL 
CORPS, OCEANOGRAPHY, SUPPLY CORPS, AND SURFACE WARFARE/ ENGINEERING DUTY 
(SWO/ED).

6.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ADDRESSES LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE FY-14 STA-21 
SELECTION PROCESS AND BOARD.  THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO PRECLUDE COMMON 
ERRORS:
    A.  OF THE 469 APPLICATIONS RECEIVED FOR FY-14, ONLY 310 WERE BOARD 
ELIGIBLE.  A TOTAL OF 50 WERE SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FY-14 STA-21 
PROGRAM.
    B.  EACH YEAR, PACKAGES ARE NOT CONSIDERED DUE TO NON-QUALIFYING SAT/ACT 
TEST SCORES, MISSING COMMANDING OFFICER (CO) ENDORSEMENT, RECENT NON-JUDICIAL 
PUNISHMENT, MISSING PHYSICAL FITNESS ASSESSMENT(PFA) CYCLES, MISSING OR 
ILLEGIBLE SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTS, AND NOT MEETING PROGRAM AGE OR PFA 
REQUIREMENTS.
    C.  MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET BEFORE SUBMITTING AN 
APPLICATION.  APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE MAILED ONLY WHEN FULLY COMPLETED.  
OFFICER INTERVIEW BOARDS SHALL CONSIST OF THREE OFFICERS; THE APPLICANT'S CO 
IS NOT A BOARD MEMBER AND SHOULD NOT SUBMIT AN INTERVIEW APPRAISAL SHEET.  
THE CO'S PERSONAL INTERVIEW SHOULD ONLY BE CONDUCTED AFTER THE APPLICATION IS 
COMPLETE AND THE OFFICER INTERVIEW BOARD HAS SUBMITTED THEIR APPRAISALS.  THE 
FULL PICTURE OF AN APPLICANT'S ACADEMIC AND OFFICER POTENTIAL CAN ONLY BE 
DETERMINED BY REVIEWING THE SAT/ACT SCORES, HIGH SCHOOL/COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS, 
AND A COMPLETED APPLICATION PACKAGE.
    D.  THE CO'S ENDORSEMENT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY THE RANKING 
OF THE INDIVIDUAL AMONG HIS/HER PEERS.  THE ENDORSEMENT SHOULD CONTAIN 
SPECIFICS ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL'S ACADEMIC POTENTIAL, COMMITMENT, LEADERSHIP, 
SERVICE ABOVE SELF, AND POTENTIAL AS A NAVAL OFFICER.  CO COMMENTS SHOULD 
SPECIFY THE PRIMARY OPTION TO WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS APPLYING AND ADDRESS 
HOW THE INDIVIDUAL MEETS QUALIFICATIONS FOR THAT OPTION.
    E.  AN INTERVIEW BOARD AND NOMINATION REVIEW BOARD SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH REF (A).  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT OFFICERS OF THE APPLICANT'S 
DESIGNATOR OF CHOICE, IF AVAILABLE, BE ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 
INTERVIEW/NOMINATION REVIEW BOARD TO ASSESS THE APPLICANT FOR THEIR 
COMMUNITY.  OFFICER APPRAISALS PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT ON THE APPLICANT.  
APPRAISAL FORMS SHOULD BE TYPED IN 10 OR 12 POINT FONT.  FOR JUNIOR SAILORS 
WITH ONLY SCHOOL HOUSE EVALUATIONS, THE CO MUST ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN HIS OR 
HER ENDORSEMENT.
    F.  THE APPLICANT'S PERSONAL STATEMENT SHOULD ADDRESS WHY THE SAILOR 
WANTS TO BECOME AN OFFICER, HOW THE SAILOR'S SELECTION WOULD IMPROVE THE 
NAVY, AND WHY THE SAILOR IS APPLYING FOR A SPECIFIC OPTION.  SAILORS MUST 
ALSO ADDRESS ANY HARDSHIPS OR UNIQUE EXPERIENCES THAT SHAPED THEIR CHARACTER.  
JUNIOR SAILORS SHOULD PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCES.  HIGH 
SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS RARELY PROVIDE IN-DEPTH INFORMATION ON INVOLVEMENT IN 
SPORTS, CLUBS, VOLUNTEER WORK, ETC.  ADDITIONALLY, APPLICANTS SHOULD EXPLAIN 
ANY MITIGATING ISSUES THE BOARD NEEDS TO CONSIDER (I.E., POOR HIGH SCHOOL OR 
COLLEGE GRADES AND UNEXPLAINED GAPS).
    G.  THE APPLICATION IS A REFLECTION OF THE APPLICANT.
APPLICANTS MUST REVIEW THEIR PACKAGES IN THEIR ENTIRETY BEFORE SUBMITTING.  
CHECK FOR MISSPELLED WORDS AND GRAMMAR ISSUES.  ENSURE ALL TRANSCRIPTS (HIGH 
SCHOOL AND ALL COLLEGES) ARE ENCLOSED.
APPLICANTS MUST HAVE PASSED THE PHYSICAL READINESS TEST (PRT) WITH 
PERFORMANCE IN THE GOOD CATEGORY WITHIN THE LAST YEAR.  FOR APPLICANTS WHO 
RECEIVED A WAIVER ON THE MOST RECENT PRT, POINTS WILL BE AWARDED FROM THE 
MOST RECENT OBSERVED SCORE FROM THE LATEST FULL TEST TAKEN WITHIN A YEAR OF 
APPLICATION (I.E., FALL 2013 AND SPRING 2014).  A GRADE OF SATISFACTORY OR 
FAILURE OF EITHER OF THE ABOVE TWO REQUIRED PRTS WILL MAKE THE APPLICANT 
INELIGIBLE.  QUALIFYING SAT/ACT SCORES ARE REQUIRED.  INCLUDE ANY ADDITIONAL 
RECOMMENDATIONS, QUALIFICATIONS, OR OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS A PART OF THE 
PACKAGE.

7.  THE NAVY NEEDS INNOVATIVE AND BOLD MEN AND WOMEN TO LEAD, THINK 
CREATIVELY, CHALLENGE ASSUMPTIONS, AND TAKE WELL-CALCULATED RISKS.
TODAY'S NAVY IS COMPOSED OF MEN AND WOMEN REPRESENTING DOZENS OF DIFFERENT 
ETHNIC GROUPS AND LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS.  THE NAVY'S 
ABILITY TO MEET LEADERSHIP CHALLENGES RELIES ON HAVING LEADERS FROM OUR 
ENTIRE NAVY WHO REFLECT OUR VERY BEST.
