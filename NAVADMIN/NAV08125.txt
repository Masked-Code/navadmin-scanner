SUBJ/MILITARY SPOUSE APPRECIATION DAY// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  ON MAY 9, 2008 WE WILL OBSERVE MILITARY SPOUSE 
APPRECIATION DAY. IT IS A DAY THAT HONORS THE HUSBANDS AND WIVES WHO 
PROUDLY SERVE BESIDE US AT HOME AND ABROAD.  THEY ARE SO VITAL TO OUR 
INDIVIDUAL SUCCESSES AND THE OVERALL READINESS OF OUR NAVY.
2.  OUR NAVY ENSURES THE SECURITY, STABILITY, AND PROSPERITY OF OUR 
COUNTRY.  WHILE IT IS OUR PRIVILEGE TO SERVE OUR NAVY AND NATION, WE 
COULD NOT DO SO WITHOUT THE STEADY SUPPORT OF OUR SPOUSES.  WE CAN BE 
OUT AND ABOUT FOCUSED ON THE MISSION BEFORE US, BECAUSE OF THE LOVE AND 
SUPPORT OF OUR SPOUSES.
3.  OUR STRENGTH IS OUR PEOPLE.  YOUR MOTIVATION, INNOVATION, AND 
COMPETENCE ALLOW THE NAVY TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS THAT ROUTINELY EXCEEDS 
IMAGINATION.  BUT JUST AS OUR SAILORS ARE THE STRENGTH OF OUR NAVY, OUR 
SPOUSES AND THE LOVE, SUPPORT, AND UNDERSTANDING THEY GIVE IS A SOURCE 
OF STRENGTH FOR OUR SAILORS.
4.  ALTHOUGH WORDS CANNOT ADEQUATELY EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION, I URGE 
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TO TAKE TIME EVERY DAY, BUT ESPECIALLY ON 
FRIDAY, TO HONOR AND THANK THE HUSBANDS AND WIVES WHO SERVE ALONGSIDE 
US AND ENABLE US TO DO WHAT WE DO.
5.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
