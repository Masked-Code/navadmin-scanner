SUBJ/NOTICE OF CONVENING FY-20-2 TEST PILOT SCHOOL SELECTION BOARD//

REF/A/DOC/BUPERS/14SEP18//
AMPN/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1500.62D, TEST PILOT SCHOOLS//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces convening of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot 
School (USNTPS) Selection Board on 30 May 2019.  This board will select 
highly qualified Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers (NFO) for USNTPS, 
Empire Test Pilot School (ETPS) and U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School.  Test 
Pilot School (TPS) graduates have significant and long-lasting influence on 
platforms, systems and directly impact the future warfighting capability of 
the fleet.
Request command and fleet community assistance to identify candidates with 
strong operational performance and ideally, strong academic backgrounds in 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics fields of study.

2.  For board eligibility consideration, a command endorsed application, in 
line with reference (a), must be received by MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) no 
later than 3 May 2019.  Additional documentation (including Wing/CAG 
endorsements, letters of recommendation, fitness reports, etc.) will be 
accepted until 24 May 2019, but must be submitted by the applicant, as a 
letter to the board, in line with subparagraph 3a below.  The command 
endorsement shall explicitly state whether the applicant, if selected, will 
be available to report for initial training by the following dates:

    a.  2 September 2019 for Fixed Wing pilots
    b.  4 November 2019 for Rotary Wing pilots
    c.  2 December 2019 for NFOs

Endorsements with availability dates after these respective dates may be 
removed from consideration and not reviewed by the board.
Inability for the applicant to meet the above dates may be mitigated by 
conducting initial training in a temporary additional duty (TEMADD) status at 
the expense of the endorsing command.  If this is required, it must be 
explicitly stated in the command endorsement that the endorsing command will 
provide TEMADD funds until the applicant can officially detach.  The e-mail 
address(es), phone number(s), college transcripts and post-TPS test squadron 
assignment preferences of the applicant must be included with the 
application.
Contact information of the commanding officer must be included to expedite 
notification, if selected.

    b.  The preferred Unrestricted Line (URL, 13X0) aviators are junior 
officers (O-2 or O-3) with detailer-forecasted career timing to complete the 
selected TPS program and a 36-month follow-on test tour prior to their 
expected Department Head tour.  If there are not enough qualified junior 
officers to meet requirements, lieutenant commanders with exceptional records 
may be selected, provided they can meet follow-on test tour requirements and 
applicable career milestones.
    c.  Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer (1510) aviators through the grade 
of lieutenant commander may be selected if they are able to serve a 36-month 
follow-on test tour and still meet career milestones.
    d.  Applicants determined to have insufficient career timing to meet a 
minimum test tour of 24 months may have their application removed from 
consideration.
    e.  Applicants may only apply for the fixed wing, rotary wing or airborne 
systems curriculums as test pilots and test NFOs.  The flight test engineer 
syllabus is for AIR 5.1 civilian personnel and not available for naval
