RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN is the fourth in a series providing updates on the 
NMCI Secret Internet Protocol Routing Network (SIPRNet) and Non-Classified 
Internet Protocol Routing Network (NIPRNet) enterprise migration to WIN10 SHB 
to be completed by 31 July 2018.  The message directs the quarantine of all 
remaining non-compliant workstations by 31 July 2018 and provides specifics 
for execution.  Migration to WIN10 SHB is necessary to improve cybersecurity, 
promote standardization across the Naval Enterprise Network, and comply with 
the DOD mandates.  OPNAV N2N6 and PEO-EIS have worked extensively with the 
Fleet to prioritize migrations and understand potential operational impacts 
for workstation quarantines.  Maritime Operations Center and embarkables 
seats will be exempt from this quarantine to ensure no impact to operations.


2.  Effective 31 July 2018, all remaining Windows 7 NMCI workstations with 
the exception of previously identified MOC and embarkable machines will be 
quarantined.  Quarantined workstations will prevent all Non-administrative 
users from logging on to those specific computers.
Those workstations will show a notice in place of the DOD Warning banner 
stating the workstation has been quarantined.  Users of quarantined computers 
can use another WIN10 compliant computer to access their information on their 
home drive (H:\) or command share drive (S:\) until their computer is 
migrated to WIN10.


3.  Individual User Responsibilities:

    a.  Users that receive the quarantined notice on their computer should 
contact the command Contract Technical Representative (CTR) or IT support 
staff to have their computer migrated to WIN10.

    b.  As noted, users of quarantined computers can logon to another
WIN10 compliant computer to access their home drive or command share drive 
information until their computer is migrated to WIN10.
Commands should prioritize access to alternate workstations for users 
effected by the quarantine until the computers is upgraded to WIN10.

    c.  NIPRNet workstations and SIPRNet workstations in approved open 
storage areas should leave the quarantined workstations powered on and 
connected to the network (via cabled connection) and continue to reboot 
nightly selecting NO to the green shutdown notice.  This allows the computer 
to receive software patches, anti-virus updates and to execute the WIN10 
migration.


4.  CIO and CTR Responsibilities:

    a.  Command CIOs and CTRs must continue to aggressively track the
    progress of the WIN10 migrations within their area of responsibility to 
maximize seats completed by 31 July 2018 and minimize the number of machines 
quarantined.

    b.  While there is no authorization to extend beyond the
31 July 2018 deadline, requests for an exception to the quarantine policy can 
be provided by the CIO/CTR, endorsed by the first flag officer in the chain 
of command, and routed via CIO channels to OPNAV N2N6 for consideration.  
Requests must include:

        (1) Workstation Name

        (2) Reason for Exception request  cite specific operational impact

        (3) Mission impact if the exception is not approved

        (4) Expected date when the exception will no longer be required 
(cannot exceed 15 August 2018)

        (5) Echelon II CIOs will send requests to WIN10 Coordination Center, 
win10coordinatio.fct(at)navy.mil and OPNAV N2N6G.

    c.  Requests for Exception formats were distributed to the CIO community 
on 23 July 2018 by the WIN10 Coordination Center.
Any requests for exception previously submitted should be reviewed and 
resubmitted.

    d.  If a computer is accidentally included in the list and becomes 
quarantined on 1 August 2018, notify the CIO/CTR immediately to have it 
removed.


5.  OPNAV N2N6 Responsibilities.  OPNAV N2N6 will review exception requests 
and submit any approved requests to FLTCYBERCOM CIO at 
c10f_bwc.fct(at)navy.mil.


6.  FLTCYBERCOM/C10F Responsibilities.  FLTCYBERCOM/C10F will execute the 
quarantine according to the approved exception list provided by OPNAV N2N6G.


7.  Released by VADM Matthew J. Kohler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
