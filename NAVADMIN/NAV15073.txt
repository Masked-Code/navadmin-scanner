RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces convening of the June 2015 Active- Duty 
Officer Lateral Transfer/Redesignation Board.  One element of the Navy's 
personnel program is to properly balance the skills and experience in the 
officer corps.  As part of the process, applications from qualified 
unrestricted line, restricted line, staff corps, and limited duty officers 
(LDO) are now being accepted for an Active-Duty Officer Lateral 
Transfer/Redesignation Board which convenes 1 June 2015.  Full-Time Support 
and Selected Reserve officers are not eligible to apply for this board.

2.  In addition to the year group (YG) limitations imposed in paragraph 6, 
applicants must also meet eligibility requirements detailed in references (a) 
through (c).
    a.  Members who do not meet eligibility requirements per references (a) 
through (c), such as time-in-grade (TIG), years of commissioned service 
(YCS), or time in service (TIS) must submit a waiver package, in addition to 
their lateral transfer/redesignation application.
    b.  Waiver packages must include member's waiver request and commanding 
officer's endorsement.  This endorsement is separate from any endorsements 
contained in the member's lateral transfer/ redesignation application and 
must specifically address the eligibility requirement for a waiver.

3.  Submit applications and waiver packages per reference (b) to:

7.  Notes:
    a.  Must have surface warfare officer (SWO) qualification completed to 
apply for transfer.  Officers under SWO Continuation Pay (SWOCP) or Revised 
Junior Critical Skills Retention Bonus contract are not eligible for transfer 
until completion of bonus obligation.  SWOs serving under an agreement for 
any of the SWO bonuses are eligible to apply to the board if the board 
application due date is within one year of satisfaction of the full bonus 
obligation.
    b.  Waivers to the requirements of paragraph 4h of reference (b) for 
nuclear-trained surface and submarine warfare officers may be considered, on 
a case-by-case basis.
    c.  Officers screened "not cleared" for their next career milestone are 
eligible.
    d.  The YG range provided displays possible opportunities.
Contact your specific community placement officer with questions regarding 
quota availability for each platform/community/year group.
General aviation officers (1300) are eligible to apply for lateral transfer 
regardless of active duty service obligation (ADSO) from winging.  Aviation 
officers (131X and 132X) are eligible to apply for lateral transfer if the 
officer has fulfilled ADSO, or will be within 12 months of completing ADSO at 
the time the board convenes.
Aviation officers with obligated service as a result of Aviation Career 
Continuation Pay (ACCP) are eligible to apply if the officer will be within 
12 months of completing ACCP obligation at the time the board convenes.  
Additionally, aviation officers with obligated service as a result of ACCP 
are eligible to apply if the officer will be within 12 months of department 
head tour projected rotation date (PRD) at the time the board convenes, 
regardless of contrary ACCP contract language.  Redesignation immediately 
following department head tour may result in cancellation of ACCP, which will 
be adjudicated by PERS-43.  Aviation officers shall not be permitted to 
redesignate until completion of ADSO, fulfillment/expiration/ cancellation of 
ACCP contract, or PRD, as determined by BUPERS-313.
Aviation officers in operational flying billets (billet designator
XXX1 or XXX2) will not be permitted to redesignate until PRD.
BUPERS-313 authorizes redesignation timing and PERS-43 is the final approval 
authority on the above eligibility constraints.
    e.  Judge advocates looking to laterally transfer to another community 
should be aware that upon lateral transfer to another community, they will 
lose the three years of constructive credit provided to judge advocates upon 
commissioning.  As a consequence, some junior officers with less than four 
years of total service looking to laterally transfer may be reduced in rank 
to LTJG.
    f.  LDO redesignation requests will be reviewed on a case-by- case basis, 
considering impact to overall community health.  Nuclear LDO submissions will 
not be considered.  All other designators must have completed four years 
commissioned service and accepted permanent LDO appointment to LT prior to 
lateral transfer/ redesignation.  LDO out-quotas are extremely limited, 
special consideration will be given to officers projected to be statutorily 
separated for years of service prior to attaining the rank of commander.  
Supply Corps (SC) and Information Dominance Corps applicants in YGs 09 and 
senior will receive favorable consideration.
    g.  Officers in YG-12 and senior seeking lateral transfer into the 
surface warfare community are strongly encouraged to contact the SWO 
community manager prior to applying in order to discuss critical SWO career 
milestone requirements.
    h.  Only Restricted Line and Staff Corps selections to the Naval Special 
Warfare (NSW) community will be processed via this board.
Unrestricted Line applications for NSW will not be considered by this board.  
All applicants must be eligible for Top Secret/ Sensitive Compartmented

Warfare (IW) or Intelligence (Intel) communities:  O4 applicants for 1820 
with more than two years time-in-grade should contact the IP community 
manager to discuss milestone and performance requirements.  All officers who 
are either above or in-zone for FY-16 promotion to LCDR through CAPT will not 
be considered for lateral transfer.  IP, IW, and Intel applicants must be 
eligible for TS/SCI, submit a personnel security questionnaire
(SF-86) per reference (f), or include a letter from a Special Security 
Officer (SSO) indicating successful completion of an SCI pre-screening 
interview.  IW applicants that do not hold or are not currently eligible for 
TS/SCI must complete an SCI eligibility pre-screening interview with the 
Fleet Cyber Command Security Directorate field office at (850) 452-6868 and 
submit the results as part of their application.  All applicants must be 
worldwide assignable and fit for full sea duty.  All YG-09 and senior 6440 
and
6450 redesignation applicants will be considered.  All YG-09 and senior 6420 
redesignation applicants will be considered.
    k.  All Foreign Area Officer (FAO) applicants must be eligible for TS/SCI 
security clearance and worldwide assignable.  Worldwide assignability shall 
be verified and documented via successful overseas screening to NAVCENT
