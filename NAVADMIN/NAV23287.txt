RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN establishes the Chief of Chaplains as program sponsor 
for the professional development of Chaplain Corps (CHC) officers and 
Religious Program Specialists (RP) in line with references (a) through (h).  
The Chief of Chaplains conducts annual short-course training for CHC officers 
and RPs to sharpen the unique capabilities and competencies chaplains and RPs 
bring to the institution and to inspire excellence in delivering religious 
ministry.  The FY-24 Professional Development Training will consist of a 
total of four days and is required for all chaplains and RPs barring 
operational commitments.  This training also provides continuing education 
units, which may be required to maintain religious organization credentials.

first day, will focus on Spiritual Readiness.

3.  The Professional Development Training Course (PDTC), conducted the 
following three days, will address Building Spiritual Readiness Through 
Counseling. The PDTC will train, develop, and inspire chaplains and RPs to 
develop and enhance programs that build the Spiritual Readiness of warriors 
and their commands and will provide Religious Ministry Teams with a framework 
and experience in counseling.

4.  The FY-24 PDTC objectives are to train chaplains and RPs to be able to:
    a.  Identify the Navy standard of pastoral counseling.
    b.  Distinguish how this may differ from Religious Organization
(RO) standards of faith group-specific counseling.
    c.  Identify how it may overlap with RO standards of faith group-specific 
counseling.
    d.  Describe how Professional Naval Chaplaincy (PNC) informs counseling.
    e.  Differentiate pastoral counseling done in the "provision
        competency" from counseling done in the "care competency.
    f.  Present the Naval standards for pastoral counseling.
