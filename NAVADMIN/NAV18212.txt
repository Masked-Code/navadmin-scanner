SUBJ/ORDER TO UPDATE NAVY FAMILY ACCOUNTABILITY AND ASSESSMENT SYSTEM 
PERSONAL CONTACT INFORMATION//

REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/23OCT14//

AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 3006.1, PERSONNEL ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
CATASTROPHIC EVENTS.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the semi-annual update/verification of 
personal information in the Navy Family Accountability and Assessment System 
(NFAAS) by all Navy military and civilian personnel that must be completed no 
later than 30 September 2018.
If a record has been updated in the system between 1 May 2018 to
30 September 2018, that record is considered validated for the
30 September 2018 deadline.  NFAAS is the system utilized by the Navy to 
account for personnel and their families during widespread natural or man-
made disasters.  Accurate contact information of personnel and family members 
is required to facilitate a quick and accurate muster of personnel in 
affected areas.  As directed in reference (a), updates of personal 
information will be verified as current semi-annually.

2.  Applicability.  This message applies to all Navy personnel, uniformed 
(Active Duty and Reserve), Navy civilians and Outside Continental United 
States (OCONUS) contractors in line with the
following:
    a.  It is required for all military personnel to update and verify 
contact information and all categories of dependents.
    b.  It is mandatory for non-bargaining unit civilian employees to update 
their contact information.  Providing dependent information is voluntary but 
highly encouraged.  Failure to provide dependent information may exclude them 
from receiving potential benefits, if applicable.
    c.  Bargaining unit civilian employees are highly encouraged to provide 
their contact and dependent information on a voluntary basis, until union 
notification and subsequent impact and implementation bargaining takes place 
(when applicable).  Providing contact information is critical in providing 
support to Department of the Navy civilians and their dependents during the 
recovery period following a disaster.

3.  Echelon II Commanders, Region Commanders, and Region Personnel 
Accountability Representatives will ensure widest dissemination to all 
subordinate, tenant commands, and detachments for action as required.  All 
commanding officers (CO)/officers-in-charge (OIC) will ensure timely and 
accurate updates of Navy member and family member contact information as 
stated above.  COs/OICs will also contact the Human Resources Office to 
request applicable union notifications.  This requirement also includes 
OCONUS contractors (must enter associated unit identification code).  A 
report of those commands not in compliance with this NAVADMIN will be 
provided to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations for review.

4.  Additionally, each command will institute policies requiring personnel to 
update their NFAAS data during check-in and check-out as standard practice.  
Military members/dependents must also update NFAAS in any instance in which 
they make a permanent change of address.  Civilian non-bargaining unit 
employees must update their contact information and are highly encouraged to 
update their dependents information on a voluntary basis whenever there is a 
change.  Civilian bargaining unit employees are highly encouraged to update 
their information whenever there is a change.

5.  To update contact data, utilize the NFAAS site at 
https://navyfamily.navy.mil.  Login and update member information under the 
*My Info* tab, *Contact Information* section, and update sponsor's work 
location information.  Update family member information under the *My Info* 
tab, *Family Member Info* section.
Edit member and family member information as necessary and verify as current.  
All family members enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member Program must be 
identified as such.

6.  The NFAAS site can also be accessed from any Android, Iphone, or 
Blackberry mobile device web browser.  Although the application uses the same 
uniform resource locator address as the NFAAS website, when accessed via 
mobile device, the site will be optimized to allow easy viewing and 
navigation.

7.  CO Representatives can validate contact information has been verified by 
using the personnel tab in NFAAS and use the *Export To
Excel* option.  Column *N* contains the date the contact information was last 
updated.

8.  A tool is available in NFAAS to allow commands to *pull* personnel into 
their unit identification code (UIC).  This prevents information from 
incorrectly remaining in a previous UIC and not being accounted for in the 
current command within NFAAS.

9.  Points of contact:
    a.  NFAAS Help Desk/Space and Naval Warfare System Command at
(866) 946-9183 or via e-mail and can be reached at nfaas(at)spawar.navy.mil.
    b. NFAAS Program Manager, Chief Isa Grace, can be reached at
(202) 433-4321 or via e-mail at isa.n.grace(at)navy.mil.

10.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or cancelled, 
whichever occurs first.
