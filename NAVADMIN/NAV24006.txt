RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN changes policy and procedures for the assignment of 
pregnant Service Members in accordance with references (a), (b), and 
(c).  Pregnancy is a natural event that can occur in the lives of 
Sailors.  Pregnant Sailors are fully participating members of our Navy team 
and deserve every opportunity to continue their careers and advancement 
progression while serving our country. 
 
2.  Effective immediately, upon official command notification of pregnancy 
consistent with references (d) and (e), and submission of reassignment 
availability, pregnant Sailors will be re-assigned to fill a valid manpower 
requirement.  Operational deferment (shore duty) orders will be written for a 
minimum of 24-months with a detach date approximately 30-days from receipt of 
the availability report.  Once shore orders are executed, Sailors will be 
expected to complete their shore tour regardless of pregnancy status. 
    a.  Operational units.  Pregnant Sailors serving in a sea duty billet 
will receive operational deferment orders and be transferred to a shore duty 
billet to fill a valid manpower requirement, wherever possible. 
        (1)  Upon official notification of a Sailor's pregnancy status, 
consistent with guidance in references (d) and (e), sea duty activities are 
required to submit a reassignment due to pregnancy and post-partum 
availability report via Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) for 
enlisted and via the community detailer for officers to include the following 
information: 
            (a)  20th week of pregnancy date 
            (b)  Estimated date of delivery 
            (c)  Any factor(s) or limitation(s) that should be considered in 
the assignment process. 
        (2)  Pregnant Sailors may request a waiver to remain onboard 
operational commands for the duration of the pregnancy and post- partum 
period to include any convalescent and parental leave.  This 
operational deferment waiver must include endorsements from the 
Service Member, the commanding officer or officer in charge, and the 
health care provider.  The waiver request will be submitted via 
salesforce for enlisted and to the community detailer for officers. 
Individual detailers will have final approval. 
        (3)  Sailors on their operational deferment (shore tour) 
will be issued a PRD that is 12-months post-delivery per reference 
(a).  Sailors will rotate at their PRD and they are directed to 
begin orders negotiation 12-months prior to their PRD via the normal 
MNA process for enlisted and through the detailer for officers. 
Upon selection for a sea duty assignment, Sailors will be issued 
orders to sea duty for a full sea tour.  Sea duty served immediately 
prior to the operational deferment is not credited to the new full 
sea tour. 
    b.  Shore units.  Pregnant Sailors assigned to shore duty that 
are within 13-months of their Projected Rotation Date (PRD) may 
extend onboard their current command or move to another command 
within the geographic location to fill a valid manpower requirement. 
If there is not a suitable, valid manpower requirement meeting 
pregnant Sailors' needs, NPC will work to send Sailors to a command 
in a non-refillable excess position where continued community and/or 
rating development and mentorship is available. 
    c.  Pregnant Sailors assigned in excess may be transferred to 
another command within the same geographic region, if a valid 
manpower requirement is identified which allows the Sailor a career 
enhancing opportunity. 
    d.  Sailors may request to cancel their post-partum operational 
deferment in order to return to an operational command (TAC C or D 
(officers) or type duty 2 or 4 (enlisted)).  Requests must be 
initiated by the Service Member, in line with reference (f), using 
Officer Personnel Action Request (NAVPERS 1301/85) or Enlisted 
Personnel Action Request (NAVPERS 1306/7). 
    e.  For assistance or further information, please contact your 
detailer. 
 
4.  Perinatal Loss. 
    a.  Perinatal Loss (miscarriage or stillbirth):  If a Sailor has 
not executed their shore orders and has experienced a perinatal 
loss, sea duty activities are required to submit a termination of 
pregnancy tour requirement (DY) availability report via the 
community detailer for officers and via NSIPS for enlisted.  Upon 
receipt of the DY availability report, orders will be cancelled and 
the Sailor will remain onboard the current activity through their 
normal PRD. 
    b.  Convalescent Leave following Perinatal Loss.  Perinatal loss 
presents significant risk to Sailor readiness if returning to duty 
before fully recovered.  Sailors who experience perinatal loss may 
be granted convalescent leave with guidance from their health care 
provider in line with medical practice standards and consistent with 
reference (g).  Significant consideration should be given to the 
overarching emotional impact of loss when determining amount of 
convalescent leave granted.  Convalescent leave is intended to 
provide time for appropriate recovery from a medical condition. 
 
5.  Fleet activities seeking an exemption to receive pregnant 
Sailors onboard for mission or industrial hygiene reasons should 
submit requests providing justification via endorsement by their 
Immediate Superior in Command, Type Commander or Budget Submitting 
Office, and Fleet readiness integrator to Career Management Pillar 
(PERS-4) for review and final disposition. 
 
6.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
