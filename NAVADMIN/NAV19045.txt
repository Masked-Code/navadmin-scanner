RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN is the second in a series on the Navy Marine Corps 
Intranet (NMCI) Secret Internet Protocol Routing Network
(SIPRNet) and
Non-Classified Internet Protocol Routing Network (NIPRNet) transition to 
Windows 10 (WIN10) version 1803 (v1803).  It outlines current status and 
efforts being taken to resolve remaining challenges.  This evolution was 
extensively coordinated with U.S.
Fleet Cyber Command (FCC)/Commander, U.S. TENTH Fleet (C10F), the Program 
Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), and Echelon II 
Chief Information Officers (CIOs).  Continued maximum effort is necessary by 
leadership at all commands to get the Navy to 100 percent WIN10 v1803 for all 
NMCI seats by 31 March 2019 in order to improve cyber security, promote 
standardization across the Naval Enterprise Network, and comply with 
Department of Defense mandates.

2.  As of 24 February 2019, status for NIPRNet is at 31.3 percent and for 
SIPRNet is at 19.1 percent complete.  Challenges being addressed
:
    a.  Green Shutdowns:  A Green Shutdown is a means to ensure that large 
updates can successfully download during off-hours, minimizing impact to 
productivity.  Nightly Green Shutdowns are the key to success as they enable 
gradual receipt of required pre-load packages and proper update installation.  
Those seats that conducted Green Shutdowns have experienced a WIN10 v1803 
update success rate of over
99 percent.  However, many seats still await Green Shutdown.  CIOs and 
Contract Technical Representatives (CTRs) must be proactive in ensuring their 
command personnel expeditiously execute Green Shutdowns.  Additionally, in 
order to assist CIOs and ensure compliance, FCC/C10F directed forced 
shutdowns commencing 14 February 2019.  All machines not rebooted within a 7-
day period will automatically restart.  This is critical to seat readiness 
and there are no waivers to this requirement. Details on how to conduct Green 
Shutdowns are listed in para 3.
    b.  Mandatory McAfee Security Modules and Reboots:  These enable update 
of key security features to protect user workstations and data.  WIN10 v1803 
update requires multiple dependent McAfee security modules.  Some users may 
require varying numbers of McAfee -related reboots.  Users receiving prompts 
to reboot their workstations shall comply per NMCI User Awareness Bulletin.

3.  Individual User Responsibilities
    a.  End of Day Actions.  All users shall restart their seats nightly 
selecting Green Shutdown.  Users will need to execute a Green Shutdown by 
clicking the Windows logo from the desktop bar, selecting Shut down or 
Restart, and selecting Yes when prompted to perform a Green Shutdown.  Please 
note that Green Shutdowns are usually quick when done regularly and time-
consuming when not done as a best practice.  Once each seat receives all 
required preload packages, the user will receive a notification that the
WIN10 v1803 update is ready for installation.  Users will then need to 
execute another Green Shutdown which will manage the reboot cycle necessary 
to complete the installation overnight.
    b.  Protection of Personal Data.  Users should back up any personal data 
on their seats by utilizing their personal H:  drive or contacting their 
Information Technician support staff for alternate backup methods if data 
backup exceeds H:  drive capacity.
    c.  Network Connection.  Users must ensure that individual machines are 
plugged in and physically connected to the NMCI network when scheduled for 
migration.  WIN10 v1803 update cannot be completed via NMCI Enterprise WiFi 
or Remote Access Service connection.
    d.  XPS Viewer.  Microsoft has retired XPS Viewer and it is not supported 
in WIN10 v1803.  Users are advised to check if they retain files in XPS 
format and convert to PDF before migration.
    e.  Users in Restricted Access/Controlled Access Areas are recommended to 
preload seats by Digital Video Disk in accordance with instruction provided 
separate correspondence.

4.  The NMCI Service Desk has established top-level end user support directly 
for WIN10 v1803 that can be accessed by dialing (866) 843
-6624 and selecting Option 3 from the option prompt.  Users experiencing 
failed rollovers due to technical issues will be contacted by the service 
desk with required actions prior to the next attempted update.

Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
