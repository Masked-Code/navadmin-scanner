OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTIES A101, A430, AND B230//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN approves the elimination of the reserve component Navy 
Occupational Specialties (NOS) Codes A101 (formerly ABE), A430 (formerly AS), 
and B230 (formerly IC) effective 1 November 2016.  These NOS code 
eliminations apply to the Selected Reserve (SELRES) (excluding Full-Time

conversion opportunities.  Sailors not electing to convert, transfer to the 
IRR-ASP, or retire (if eligible) will be subject to forced conversion.  
Deadline for Sailors to submit change of NOS requests is 31 January 2017.  E6 
and below Sailors shall submit change of NOS applications using the career 
waypoint conversion module and E7/E8 Sailors shall submit a change of NOS 
package in line with the Administrative Procedures for Navy Reservist, 
BUPERSINST 1001.39F.  For mobilized Sailors, NOS conversion must be requested 
within 90 days of demobilization.

3.  Commands should assist their SELRES Sailors in submitting conversion 
packages as expeditiously as possible.  Ensure Sailors are fully qualified 
for requested conversions.
