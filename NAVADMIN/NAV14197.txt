RMKS/1.  The Copernicus Award was established to recognize individual 
contributions to naval warfare in command, control, communications, 
computers, and intelligence (C4I), information systems, and information 
warfare.  The award is sponsored by the Armed Forces Communications and 
Electronics Association (AFCEA) and the U.S. Naval Institute (USNI).

2.  Award criteria and eligibility.  Fiscal year 2014 nominees must have made 
a specific, demonstrable contribution to the advancement of C4I, information 
systems, or Information Warfare.  Contributions can be technical in nature, 
but may also originate from doctrinal, financial, organizational, or other 
dimensions of information systems.  The contribution should involve 
exceptional initiative, leadership, and insight within the nominee*s area of 
expertise.  All Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Civil Service personnel 
are eligible for nomination.  Up to 30 awardees will be selected.  Each 
nominating command is limited to two nominees.  No contractor or team (more 
than one person) nominations will be accepted.  Nominations must be 
unclassified.

3.  Nominations and presentation.  The awardees will be selected through 
nominations from Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard (including Joint/North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization) commands, afloat and ashore.  Nominations must 
be on letterhead and submitted by scan/email (preferred), mail, or fax.  
Nominations for Commanding Officers or Officers in Charge must be signed by 
their immediate superior in command.  Flag endorsements and letters of 
recommendation are neither required nor desired.  The nomination template and 
additional nomination package information, as well as the most up-to-date 
point of contact information can be found at
