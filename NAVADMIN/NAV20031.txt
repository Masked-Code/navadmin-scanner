(RC) board will consider personnel serving on Active Duty as FTS and SELRES,

the SELRES requirements for advancement.

in-rate (TIR) waivers must have an ending date by this date and must be

4.  Eligibility Criteria.  Candidates must meet the eligibility requirements 
outlined in chapters 2 and 11 of reference (a) and this NAVADMIN prior to the 
scheduled board convening date.  All requirements must be reflected in the 
enlisted master file prior to the board convening.  Requirements achieved or 
posted to the record of the candidates after the scheduled board convening 
date will be considered late and do not make a candidate eligible for the 
regularly scheduled board or entitle a candidate to a special selection 
board.  If candidates are deemed ineligible for advancement and later regain 
eligibility, submit a message formatted e-mail to Naval Education Training 
Professional Development Center (NETPDC)(N321) and Selection Board 
Eligibility Branch (PERS-802) requesting validation of eligibility status and 
provide an explanation.  Eligibility requirements include:
    a.  The name of the candidate appears on the selection board eligibility 
list in the correct competitive group on their profile sheet.  Candidates 
should register for e-mail notification for profile sheet updates via MyNavy 
Portal at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-advancement-center/my-
advancement.  Candidates and commands share equal responsibility to ensure 
the eligibility list is accurate.  Because eligibility status can change 
without direct notification, candidates should verify their profile sheet on 
a continuous basis.  Commands must verify their examination status 
verification reports weekly through the projected board adjourn date at the 
Navy Enlisted Advancement System (NEAS) website via MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-advancement-center/my-eso.
    b.  TIR date must be on or before l January 2018.  In line with reference 
(a), the terminal eligibility date used to compute TIR is 1 January 2021.  If 
an early promote (EP) TIR waiver is granted, the evaluation used to grant the 
EP TIR waiver must be available to the board.
    c.  High year tenure (HYT) waivers must be approved prior to the board 
convening.  HYT date or approved HYT waivers for the current paygrade must be 
dated 1 September 2020 or later.  Candidates who will be at HYT on 
1 September 2020 for the next higher paygrade are ineligible for advancement, 
regardless of any approved HYT waiver.
    d.  Commands must-revalidate members whose disapproved or canceled 
retirement authorization is adjudicated prior to selection board convening 
date by sending an e-mail with a reason for revalidation to PERS-802.  See 
paragraph 208 of reference (a) for fleet reserve request impacts to 
eligibility.
    e.  Security clearance requirements.  See paragraph 203 of reference (a).  
Ratings requiring a security clearance are AC, AE, AG, AO, AT, AWF, AWO, AWR, 
AWS, AWV, AZ, CTI, CTM, CTN, CTR, CTT, EOD, ET, FC, FCA, GM, HT, IC, IS, IT, 
LN, MA, MC, MN, ND, OS, QM, SB, SO, STG and YN, as well as all nuclear and 
submarine ratings.
    f.  Rate specific and competitive group eligibility requirements.
Candidates must meet special requirements for certain ratings, as outlined in 
paragraphs 203 and 206 of reference (a).  Required Navy enlisted 
classifications (NEC) must be posted in the enlisted master file prior to the 
regularly scheduled board convening date.
NECs posted to the enlisted master file after the regularly scheduled board 
convening date, even with a prior date, will not entitle a candidate to a 
special selection board.  Commands must verify and submit a message formatted 
e-mail to NETPDC (N321) and PERS-802 requesting invalidation of those 
selection board eligible candidates who no longer meet rate specific and 
competitive group qualifications listed in reference (a) or below by the 
scheduled board convening date.
        (1) Non-nuclear submarine Sailors must be designated as either SS, SU 
or SQ in line with reference (b) as of the board convening date to be 
eligible.  Candidates designated as SG or SP are not eligible for 
advancement.
        (2) Canvasser recruiter personnel are ineligible for advancement to 
E-7.

5.  Record review and communication with the E-7 selection board refer to 
reference (c).
    a.  Communication to the board must originate from the individual 
candidate and must be accompanied under the signed LTB of the candidate.
