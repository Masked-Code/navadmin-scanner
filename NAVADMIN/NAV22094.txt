RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN promulgates the Navy Security Force (NSF) 
Qualification Program and the release of reference (a), which establishes the 
qualification requirements and designation procedures for Navy Security 
Forces in accordance with reference (b). 
 
2.  The NSF Qualification Program design follows proven existing models which 
build on technical and tactical professional knowledge required to succeed in 
the kinetic environment.  The program allows for the development of NSF 
proficiency at their respective apprentice, journeyman and master skills 
levels by providing personnel a career training continuum considered 
foundational in revolutionizing NSF readiness.  The program directly supports 
unit training and formal certification processes within the respective 
operational demands of the security force enterprise, Fleet wide.  The NSF 
Qualification Program and insignia(s) will signify and serve as a force 
development program designed to unify standards across all NSF mission areas. 
The NSF Qualification Program is an extension of the Ready Relevant Learning 
process focused on force training and development efforts to improve 
individual skill progression, and supports advancement and selection 
milestones in achieving NSF professionalization. 
 
3.  Per reference (a), the NSF Qualification Program is open to all Active 
Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) rated Master-at-Arms (MA) and 
649X/749X designated NSF Officers (NSFO) who meet the eligibility 
requirements.  To ensure standardized execution between AC and RC, the NSF 
Qualification Program and all processes therein will be administered by the 
AC NSF and under the AC commanding officers authority.  As such, RC MAs and 
NSFOs not assigned to Navy Reserve NSF units in support of AC NSF units are 
ineligible to complete or receive NSF qualification. 
 
4.  Per reference (a), PQSs are available on the My Navy Portal (MNP) Web 
site (https://www.mnp.navy.mil/).

5.  Upon award of the letter of designation, the NSFO or MA will be entitled 
to wear the appropriate NSF insignia when made available through 
NEXCOM.  Wear of NSF Qualification insignia will be in accordance with 
reference (c) for qualification insignia.  A future update of reference (c) 
will include appropriate mention and illustrations of the new insignias.
