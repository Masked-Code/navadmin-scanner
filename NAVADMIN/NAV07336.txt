SUBJ/ADMINISTRATION OF THE NAVY-WIDE ADVANCEMENT EXAM FOR SAILORS IN 
IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, AND THE HORN OF AFRICA// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN SUPERSEDES NAVADMIN 139/07 AND IS A CHANGE TO 
THE NAVY ADVANCEMENT MANUAL, BUPERSINST 1430.16F.  THIS NAVADMIN 
UPDATES THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR ADMINISTERING NAVY-WIDE EXAMS TO 
SAILORS WHO ARE DEPLOYING, DEPLOYED TO OR RETURNING FROM OPERATIONS IN 
IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, OR THE HORN OF AFRICA.  THESE GUIDELINES WILL APPLY 
TO E4 THROUGH E7/LDO EXAMS FOR BOTH ACTIVE DUTY AND RESERVE PERSONNEL.  
THESE CHANGES ARE MADE AS WE LEARN HOW BEST TO SUPPORT OUR SAILORS 
FIGHTING THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM.
2.  EFFECTIVE WITH THE ACTIVE DUTY AND FTS CYCLE 198 (JAN 08) AND THE 
INACTIVE DUTY (RESERVE) CYCLE 082 (FEB 08) ADVANCEMENT EXAMS, THE 
FOLLOWING CHANGES TO THE NAVY-WIDE ADVANCEMENT POLICIES FOR PERSONNEL 
WHO ARE DEPLOYING, DEPLOYED TO OR RETURNING FROM OPERATIONS IN IRAQ, 
AFGHANISTAN, OR THE HORN OF AFRICA APPLY:
    A.  IN COUNTRY EXAM ADMINISTRATION FOR E4-E6 CANDIDATES:
        (1)  IN COUNTRY COMMANDING OFFICERS AND OICS OF COMMANDS, NOT 
DETACHMENTS, MAY AUTHORIZE EXAM ADMINISTRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL SAILOR 
BASIS WHEN THEY DETERMINE THE AREA IS CONDUCIVE TO EXAM ADMINISTRATION 
AND THE SAILORS HAVE THE PROPER TIME AND MATERIALS TO PREPARE.  
        (2)  IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IN COUNTRY COMMANDS ORDER 
SUBSTITUTE EXAMS WHICH CAN BE ADMINISTERED BEFORE OR AFTER THE REGULAR 
EXAM DATE TO PROVIDE THE MOST FLEXIBILITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF 
EXAMS.
        (3)  ACTIVE DUTY/FULL-TIME SUPPORT (FTS) EXAMS ARE NOT 
INTERCHANGEABLE WITH RESERVE EXAMS.
        (4)  THE FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED IN THIS NAVADMIN IS IN NO WAY 
INTENDED TO DISADVANTAGE ANY SAILOR.  EVERY EFFORT SHALL BE MADE TO 
PROVIDE SAILORS THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO PERFORM WELL ON THEIR EXAM. 
THIS MAY REQUIRE PRIOR PLANNING TO HAVE THE SAILOR TAKE AN EARLY EXAM 
BEFORE GOING IN COUNTRY OR POSTPONING THE EXAM UNTIL THE SAILOR RETURNS.  
PARENT COMMANDS AND IN COUNTRY COMMANDS MUST ALSO CONSIDER HIGH YEAR 
TENURE LIMITATIONS WHEN DECIDING WHICH EXAM A SAILOR SHOULD TAKE.
        (5)  PARENT COMMANDS ARE INHERENTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
ORDERING OF THEIR SAILORS? EXAMS AND THE SUBMISSION OF A CURRENT, 
VALIDATED WORKSHEET IF THE IN COUNTRY COMMANDING OFFICER (CO) 
AUTHORIZES AN IN COUNTRY EXAM.  COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PARENT AND IN 
COUNTRY COMMANDS IS VITAL.  IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PARENT COMMANDS 
ENSURE THEIR SAILORS ARRIVE IN COUNTRY WITH THE MOST RECENT EVALUATION 
AND EXAM WORKSHEET, AND UPDATE AS NECESSARY.
        (6)  PROCEDURES FOR IN COUNTRY EXAM ADMINISTRATION ARE 
DISCUSSED IN PARA 4.
    B.  ALL E7 AND LDO CANDIDATES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE E7 
ADVANCEMENT EXAM PER BUPERSINST 1430.16F ARE WAIVED FROM THE E7 
ADVANCEMENT EXAM IF THEY MEET THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS IN PARAS 3 
AND 8 OF THIS NAVADMIN. 
    C.  NAVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND 
TECHNOLOGY CENTER (NETPDTC), PERS-4G AND THE EXPEDITIONARY COMBAT 
READINESS CENTER (ECRC) WILL WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE PARENT COMMANDS 
AND IN COUNTRY COMMANDS A LIST OF INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE (IA)/GLOBAL WAR 
ON TERRORISM SUPPORT ASSIGNMENT (GSA) SAILORS FOR WHOM THIS NAVADMIN 
APPLIES.
3.  ELIGIBILITY
    A.  ELIGIBLE AREAS.  SAILORS MUST BE DEPLOYED OR DEPLOYING TO IRAQ, 
AFGHANISTAN OR COUNTRIES WITHIN COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCE-HORN OF 
AFRICA RESPONSIBILITIES.  PERSONNEL DEPLOYED TO IRAQI OIL PLATFORMS ARE 
CONSIDERED DEPLOYED TO IRAQ.
        (1) IN COUNTRY ASSIGNMENT DOES NOT INCLUDE:  ASSIGNMENTS IN 
COUNTRIES BORDERING THE ELIGIBLE AREAS (I.E., KUWAIT, BAHRAIN, ETC.),

INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE ELIGIBLE AREAS.  SAILORS MUST HAVE BOOTS-ON- 
GROUND IN THE SPECIFIED AREAS.
    B.  ELIGIBLE ASSIGNMENTS.  AN ELIGIBLE ASSIGNMENT IS ONE IN WHICH 
THE SAILOR IS REQUIRED TO SERVE AT LEAST 30 CONSECUTIVE DAYS IN ONE OF 
THE ELIGIBLE AREAS.  SAILORS ARE ELIGIBLE PRIOR TO COMPLETING THE 30 
CONSECUTIVE DAYS AS LONG AS THE ASSIGNMENT IS SCHEDULED FOR 30 
CONSECUTIVE DAYS OR MORE.  STANDBY OR ALTERNATE ASSIGNMENTS ARE NOT 
QUALIFYING UNLESS OFFICIAL ORDERS ARE ISSUED CHANGING THE STATUS TO 
PRIMARY, OR THE SAILOR IS IN EXTENDED COMBAT SKILLS TRAINING FOR 
GREATER THAN 45 DAYS DURING THE TIME OF THE REGULAR EXAM.  
    C.  ELIGIBLE TIMEFRAMES
        (1) ELIGIBILITY COMMENCES ON THE DEPLOYMENT DATE, WHICH IS 
DEFINED AS THE DATE PERSONNEL DEPART THEIR HOME DUTY STATION ENROUTE TO 
AN IN COUNTRY ASSIGNMENT (TO INCLUDE THE INDOCTRINATION AND TRAINING 
PIPELINE SPECIFIC TO THE ASSIGNMENT), BUT NOT INCLUDING ANY PERSONAL 
LEAVE.
        (2) ELIGIBILITY CONTINUES THROUGH THE DATE PERSONNEL RETURN 
FROM THEIR ASSIGNMENT TO THEIR HOMEPORT/PERMANENT DUTY STATION.
        (3) THE ACTUAL DAYS OF DETACHMENT AND RETURN ARE ELIGIBLE DATES 
FOR THIS WAIVER.
    D.  NOT EVERY CONTINGENCY IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM CAN BE 
FORESEEN.  IF FURTHER AMPLIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS IS 
NEEDED, CONTACT THE POINTS OF CONTACT IN PARA 11 OF THIS NAVADMIN. 
4.  IN COUNTRY EXAM ADMINISTRATION
    A.  E4-E6 EXAMS MAY NOT BE ADMINISTERED TO PERSONNEL SERVING IN 
COUNTRY IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, AND THE HORN OF AFRICA ON AN INDIVIDUAL 
BASIS WITHOUT CERTIFICATION THAT THE ENVIRONMENT AND OPERATIONAL TEMPO 
ARE CONDUCIVE TO EXAM ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT THE NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN 
A CONVOY.  THE AFFECTED SAILORS SHOULD ALSO HAVE THE PROPER TIME AND 
MATERIALS TO PREPARE.  REASONS FOR AREAS FOUND NOT CONDUCIVE INCLUDE, 
BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SAFETY, OPERATIONAL, AND LOGISTICAL LIMITATIONS.
    B.  IN THEATER COMMANDING OFFICERS WILL FORWARD AUTHORIZATION VIA 
THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE CHAIN OF COMMAND (SEE EXAMPLES BELOW).

        (4)  COPIES OF ALL APPROVALS SHALL BE FORWARDED TO APPROPRIATE 
ECRC NIASU IN COUNTRY FOR OVERALL TRACKING/COORDINATION PURPOSES.
    D.  EXAMS SHALL BE ADMINISTERED FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURES IN CHAPTER 
SIX OF BUPERSINST 1430.16F (NAVY ADVANCEMENT MANUAL).
    E.  TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY, IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT 
IN COUNTRY COMMANDS ORDER E4-E6 SUBSTITUTE EXAMS WHICH CAN BE 
ADMINISTERED BEFORE OR AFTER THE REGULAR EXAM DATE, AND ARE NOT 
REQUIRED TO BE ADMINISTERED ON ONE SPECIFIC DATE OR TO ALL SAILORS ON 
THE SAME DATE WITHIN THE SAME COMMAND.  REGULAR EXAMS ARE ADMINISTERED

CALCULATIONS.
    F.  ALL E7/LDO CANDIDATES WHO MEET THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS IN 
PARAS 3 AND 8 WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN EXAM, EVEN IF A 
LOCATION HAS BEEN CERTIFIED AS CONDUCIVE TO EXAM ADMINISTRATION.  
SAILORS WAIVED FROM THE EXAM DUE TO THIS NAVADMIN WHO ALREADY 
PARTICIPATED IN AN EARLY EXAM WILL HAVE THOSE EXAMS INVALIDATED.  
PARENT COMMANDS MUST FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES IN PARA 8.
5.  ORDERING EXAMS FOR IN COUNTRY ADMINISTRATION
    A.  EXAMS MAY BE ORDERED BUT NOT ADMINISTERED WITHOUT THE APPROVAL 
REQUIRED IN PARA 4.
    B.  PARENT COMMANDS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ORDERING EXAMS.  IN THE 
CASE OF INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE (IA) SAILORS, PARENT COMMANDS WILL LIAISON 
WITH ECRC AS NECESSARY TO ENSURE CORRECT EXAMS ARE ORDERED AND 
DELIVERED TO THE APPROPRIATE THEATER LOCATION.
    C.  EXAMS WILL BE ORDERED PER CHAPTER 4 OF BUPERSINST 1430.16F.
6.  EARLY EXAMS FOR E4-E6 CANDIDATES
    A.  SAILORS ELIGIBLE IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE 
E4-E6 ADVANCEMENT EXAMS ARE AUTHORIZED TO TAKE EARLY EXAMS IF THEY ARE 
WITHIN 60 DAYS OF A PENDING DEPLOYMENT TO IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, OR THE 
HORN OF AFRICA.
    B.  AN EARLY EXAM MAY BE REQUESTED AND ADMINISTERED FOR ANY E4-
E6 EXAM UNDER THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:
        (1) THE DEPLOYMENT DATE FALLS WITHIN A THREE-CALENDAR MONTH 
WINDOW PRIOR TO THE MONTH OF EXAM ADMINISTRATION.  DEPLOYMENT DATE IS 
DISCUSSED IN PARA 3C(1).
        (2) THE EXAM IS ADMINISTERED AND ANSWER SHEETS TRANSMITTED 
WITHIN 60 DAYS OF THE DEPLOYMENT DATE.  EXAMPLE:  SAILOR IS AN E5 
DEPLOYING ON 15 DECEMBER.  E6 EXAM WILL BE GIVEN IN MARCH.  SINCE THE 
DEPLOYMENT DATE FALLS WITHIN THE DECEMBER-FEBRUARY THREE-MONTH WINDOW, 
AN EARLY EXAM CAN BE ADMINISTERED BETWEEN 16 OCTOBER AND 14 DECEMBER.
    C.  THE EARLIEST DATES EXAMS CAN BE ORDERED ARE AS FOLLOWS:
        (1) ACTIVE DUTY E4-E6:  1 SEPTEMBER FOR THE MARCH EXAM AND 1 
MARCH FOR THE SEPTEMBER EXAM.
        (2) RESERVE E4-E6:  1 AUGUST FOR THE FEBRUARY EXAM AND 1 
FEBRUARY FOR THE AUGUST EXAM.
    D.  THE FIRST SHIPPING DATES WILL BE:
        (1) ACTIVE DUTY:  1 MAY FOR E4-E6 SEPTEMBER EXAM
        (2) ACTIVE DUTY:  1 NOVEMBER FOR E4-E6 MARCH EXAM
        (3) RESERVE:  1 APRIL FOR E4-E6 AUGUST EXAM
        (4) RESERVE:  1 OCTOBER FOR E4-E6 FEBRUARY EXAM
    E.  THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES WILL BE USED TO ORDER/TRANSMIT EARLY 
EXAMS.
        (1) NO MORE THAN 90 DAYS PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT DATE (TO INCLUDE 
THE INDOCTRINATION AND TRAINING PIPELINE, BUT NOT INCLUDING ANY 
PERSONAL LEAVE), COMMANDS WILL SUBMIT EARLY EXAM REQUEST IN THE SAME 
FORMAT AS A SUBSTITUTE EXAM REQUEST.  PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING A 
SUBSTITUTE EXAM ARE CONTAINED IN FIGURE 4-2 OF BUPERSINST 1430.16F. 
REASON FOR AN EARLY EXAM WILL BE "CANDIDATE PENDING IN COUNTRY 
DEPLOYMENT TO IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, OR THE HORN OF AFRICA."
        (2) WHEN TRANSMITTING THE ANSWER SHEET AFTER THE EXAM, COMMANDS 
WILL INDICATE IN THE SUBJECT LINE THAT THE ANSWER SHEET IS BEING 
TRANSMITTED FOR AN EARLY EXAM CANDIDATE.  DO NOT COMBINE ACTIVE AND 
RESERVE ANSWER SHEETS.  USE SEPARATE TRANSMITTAL FOR EACH.
7.  EXAMS MISSED DUE TO IN COUNTRY ASSIGNMENTS FOR E4-E6 CANDIDATES.
    A.  SAILORS WHO ARE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE IN ALL RESPECTS TO 
PARTICIPATE IN AN EXAM CYCLE, ARE CURRENTLY DEPLOYED TO IRAQ, 
AFGHANISTAN OR THE HORN OF AFRICA, BUT ARE NOT ABLE TO TAKE THE EXAM, 
WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED NAVY-WIDE EXAM UPON 
THEIR RETURN.  AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR PREPARATION SHOULD BE 
GIVEN.
    B.  PROCESSING WILL OCCUR AS FOLLOWS:
        (1) ANSWER SHEETS.  WHEN TRANSMITTING ANSWER SHEETS FOR THESE 
INDIVIDUALS, COMMANDS WILL IDENTIFY CANDIDATES IN A SEPARATE ENCLOSURE 
TO THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL.  USE THE SAME FORMAT WHICH IS USED FOR 
"EARLY PROMOTE" CANDIDATES, BUT REPLACE THE HEADING WITH "IRAQ, 
AFGHANISTAN, HORN OF AFRICA CANDIDATES."  IN A COLUMN BESIDE THE EXAM 
SERIAL NUMBER, COMMANDS SHOULD LIST THE MISSED CYCLE(S). 
INCLUDE COPIES OF WORKSHEETS OF MISSED EXAMS TO DETERMINE PERFORMANCE 
MARK AVERAGE FOR MISSED EXAMS.
        (2) EXAM SCORING.  AFTER THE EXAM IS SCORED, FINAL MULTIPLE 
SCORES WILL BE COMPETED AGAINST THE EXAM CYCLE(S) MISSED, STARTING WITH 
THE EARLIEST MISSED CYCLE.  NETPDTC (N321) WILL APPLY THE FINAL 
MULTIPLE SCORE TO THE PREVIOUS (MISSED) EXAM CYCLE(S).  IF THIS SCORE 
WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN ADVANCEMENT, NETPDTC (N321) WILL RECORD THE 
ADJUSTED ADVANCEMENT DATE TO THE PREVIOUS CYCLE (BASED ON THE FINAL 
MULTIPLE INCREMENTS WITHIN THAT CYCLE), ISSUE A RATING CHANGE 
AUTHORIZATION, AND NOTIFY NAVPERSCOM (PERS-8/PERS-3) TO MAKE 
APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AFFECTED AREAS OF THE SAILORS?
SERVICE RECORD.
        (3) MULTIPLE EXAMS.  SAILORS WHO MISS TWO OR MORE EXAM CYCLES 
WILL HAVE THEIR FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE COMPARED TO TWO OR MORE MAKE-UP 
EXAM CYCLES AS APPROPRIATE.  FOR EXAMPLE:  A PO2 IS ASSIGNED IA TO IRAQ 
FOR THE PERIOD DECEMBER 2007 THROUGH NOVEMBER 2008, THUS MISSING BOTH 
THE MARCH 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 2008 EXAMS. 
THE SAILOR MAY TAKE THE MARCH 2009 PO1 EXAM AND HAVE IT COMPETED 
AGAINST THE MARCH 2008 EXAM (THE FIRST EXAM CYCLE MISSED).  IN THE CASE 
OF A QUALIFYING FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE, THE CANDIDATE WILL BE ADVANCED AS 
DESCRIBED ABOVE.  IF FAILED OR PASSED NOT ADVANCED (PNA), THE EXAM WILL 
THEN BE COMPETED AGAINST THE SEPTEMBER 2008 EXAM (THE SECOND CYCLE 
MISSED) WITH PNA POINTS ACCUMULATING AS APPROPRIATE. 
IN THE CASE OF A QUALIFYING FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE, THE CANDIDATE WILL BE 
ADVANCED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  IF THE SECOND EXAM IS SCORED PNA OR FAIL, 
THE SAILOR COMPETES NORMALLY IN SUBSEQUENT CYCLES.
8.  E7 AND LDO EXAM WAIVER ELIGIBILITY
    A.  THE ADVANCEMENT EXAM REQUIREMENT TO QUALIFY AS SELECTION BOARD 
ELIGIBLE (SBE) FOR E7/LDO IS WAIVED FOR THOSE E6 SAILORS, ACTIVE OR 
RESERVE, WHO MEET THE QUALIFYING CRITERIA OF PARA 3 BETWEEN THE 
FOLLOWING DATES:
        (1) ACTIVE SAILORS (INCLUDING FTS) WHO ARE EXEMPT FROM TAKING 
THE JANUARY EXAM MUST HAVE BEEN DEPLOYING, DEPLOYED TO OR RETURNING 
FROM THE ELIGIBLE AREAS FROM 1 NOVEMBER THROUGH 28 FEBRUARY.
        (2) INACTIVE DUTY (RESERVE) SAILORS WHO ARE EXEMPT FROM TAKING 
THE FEBRUARY EXAM MUST HAVE BEEN DEPLOYING, DEPLOYED TO OR RETURNING 
FROM THE ELIGIBLE AREAS FROM 1 DECEMBER THROUGH 31 MARCH.
    B.  SAILORS WHO RETURNED FROM THE ELIGIBLE AREAS BEFORE THE ABOVE 
START DATES ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THIS SBE WAIVER.  SAILORS WHO DEPART 
FOR THE ELIGIBLE AREAS AFTER THE END DATES ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THIS 
WAIVER.  PARENT COMMANDS SHOULD ENSURE AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF TIME 
FOR PREPARATION IS GIVEN.
    C.  SAILORS WAIVED FROM THE EXAM BY THIS POLICY WILL NOT AFFECT THE 
OVERALL MINIMUM FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE (FMS) REQUIRED FOR ALL OTHER 
CANDIDATES WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE NAVY-WIDE EXAM.  THE SAILORS WAIVED 
FROM THE EXAM WILL BE IN ADDITION TO THOSE CANDIDATES THAT ARE FOUND 
SELECTION BOARD ELIGIBLE THROUGH THE E7 FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE CUTOFF.
    D.  E7 AND LDO EXAM WAIVER VALIDATION MUST BE COMPLETED BY THE 
ELIGIBLE SAILOR?S PARENT COMMAND USING A VALIDATION ANSWER SHEET 
TRANSMITTAL LETTER PER FIGURE 6-2 OF BUPERSINST 1430.16F.  FIGURE 6-
2 IS A COVER SHEET WITH TWO ENCLOSURES. 
        (1) ENCLOSURE (1) TO THE TRANSMITTAL LETTER IS/ARE ANSWER
SHEET(S) OR WORKSHEET(S) AND ENCLOSURE (2) IS LISTING OF CANDIDATES.
        (2) REPLACE THE SUBJECT LINE OF FIGURE 6-2 WITH THE SUBJECT 
LINE OF THIS NAVADMIN.
        (3) ANSWER SHEETS OR WORKSHEETS MUST BE FILLED IN (BUBBLED) 
WITH NAME, SSN, EXAM RATE, CYCLE, PMA (IF KNOWN) AND UIC (WHERE RESULTS 
WILL BE MAILED) AND INCLUDED AS ENCLOSURE (1).  IF ANSWER SHEETS ARE 
UNAVAILABLE LOCALLY, THEY MAY BE REQUESTED FROM THE LOCAL PSD OR 
NETPDTC.
        (4) THESE TRANSMITTAL LETTERS SHALL BE MAILED USING FASTEST 
MEANS POSSIBLE (FEDEX WHEN AVAILABLE) IN TIME FOR NETPDTC TO RECEIVE 
THEM BY 15 APRIL (RESERVE/FTS) AND 1 MAY (ACTIVE), OR AS PROMULGATED BY 
EXAM CYCLE NAVADMIN.  ELECTRONIC (FAX OR EMAIL) SUBMISSION IS NOT 
PERMITTED.
    E.  FAILURE TO COMPLETE THIS ACTION WILL DENY AN OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE 
MEMBER THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SELECTION BOARD CONSIDERATION.
    F.  IN THE EVENT A SAILOR IS NOT PROPERLY VALIDATED BY THEIR PARENT 
COMMAND, THEY MUST FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN PARAGRAPH 102D OF 
BUPERSINST 1430.16F TO REQUEST A SPECIAL SELECTION BOARD.
    G.  AFTER RECEIPT OF THE TRANSMITTAL LETTER, NETPDTC WILL MAIL A 
PROFILE SHEET TO THE PARENT COMMAND IDENTIFYING THESE SAILORS AS 
SELECTION BOARD ELIGIBLE.  SAILORS AND EDUCATIONAL SERVICES OFFICERS 
CAN ALSO VERIFY SELECTION BOARD ELIGIBILITY VIA THE NETPDTC WEBSITE 
HTTPS://WWW.ADVANCEMENT.CNET.NAVY.MIL UNDER THE "MY ESO" HEADING.
9.  THE PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN THIS NAVADMIN WILL BE REFERENCED IN THE 
ROUTINE NAVADMIN WHICH PROMULGATES EACH EXAM CYCLE.
10.  THIS NAVADMIN APPLIES ONLY TO THOSE SAILORS SERVING IN IRAQ, 
AFGHANISTAN, OR THE HORN OF AFRICA.  WHEN FUTURE MISSION REQUIREMENTS 
DEMAND OUR SAILORS TO FIGHT THE FRONT LINES OF GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR 
(GWOT) IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, IT WILL BE EXPANDED AS APPROPRIATE.  
FOR SAILORS WHO ARE NOT DEPLOYING TO, OR WHO ARE NOT ALREADY DEPLOYED 
TO IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, AND THE HORN OF AFRICA, SUBSTITUTE EXAM 
PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN THE ADVANCEMENT MANUAL (BUPERSINST 1430.16F) 
AND THE NAVADMIN FOR THE APPLICABLE NAVY-WIDE EXAM CYCLE SHALL BE USED.
