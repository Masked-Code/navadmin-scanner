COMBAT SKILLS TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEES.  REF B 
DELINEATED RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTENDING UDARI RANGE TRAINING IN KUWAIT.  
REF C DEFINES CONVOY/IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE (IED) TRAINING 
REQUIREMENTS AT KUWAIT UDARI RANGE.// RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES 
THE MINIMUM TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR JOINT MANNING DOCUMENT (JMD) 
SOURCED NAVY INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEES
(IA*S) AND ALL SAILORS WHO ARE DEPLOYED WHETHER OR NOT ASHORE IN 
SUPPORT OF OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM/OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM
(OIF/OEF) FOR MORE THAN 30 DAYS.  REGARDLESS OF SOURCING ORIGIN, ALL 
NAVY IA*S, AD HOC ASSIGNMENTS, OR IN LIEU OF FORCES WILL ATTEND NIACT 
OR EQUIVALENT TRAINING.  REQUEST WIDEST DISSEMINATION.
2.  BUILDING UPON CENTCOM REQUIREMENTS IDENTIFIED IN REF A, NIACT WAS 
ESTABLISHED TO PROVIDE NAVY IA*S THE MINIMUM REQUIRED COMBAT SKILLS 
TRAINING TO SUCCEED WHILE DEPLOYED TO HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS IN THE 
CENTCOM AOR.  THIS THREE-WEEK COURSE IS CONDUCTED AT FT JACKSON, SC.
COMMANDER U.S. FLEET FORCES COMMAND (USFFC) AND OPNAV IDENTIFY 
PERSONNEL REQUIRED TO ATTEND NIACT; PERS-4G ACTS AS QUOTA CONTROL AND 
SCHEDULES BILLETS THROUGH THE IA ORDERS PROCESS.  COMMANDS TEMPORARILY 
SENDING SAILORS TO NAVCENT AOR FOR MORE THAN 30 DAYS SHOULD CONTACT THE 
NAVCENT AUGMENTATION CELL AT M-BA-CUSNC-AUGCELL(AT)ME.NAVY.MIL OR DSN 
(318) 439-4240/9219 TO DETERMINE IF NIACT, OR EQUIVALENT TRAINING, IS 
REQUIRED FOR THE TAD LOCATION.  COMMANDER NAVAL EXPEDITIONARY COMBAT 
COMMAND (NECC) AND COMMANDING OFFICER, NAVY EXPEDITIONARY COMBAT 
READINESS CENTER (ECRC) ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IA OVERSIGHT.
3.  MAJOR NIACT TOPICS INCLUDE:
    - GENERAL COMBAT SKILLS
    - WEAPONS USE AND MAINTENANCE
    - COMBAT LIFE SAVER
    - CONVOY OPS AND COMBAT MOVEMENT
    - LAND NAVIGATION
    - COMMUNICATIONS
    - ADMIN AND EQUIPMENT ISSUE
4.  BECAUSE COMBAT SKILLS ARE PERISHABLE AND U.S. AND ENEMY TACTICS, 
TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES (TTP*S) ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING, COMUSFFC 
AND COMNECC HAVE DETERMINED THAT AN IA MUST SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE NIACT 
WITHIN 90 DAYS BEFORE EACH DEPLOYMENT.  SAILORS WHO RECEIVED MORE 
EXTENSIVE COMBAT SKILLS TRAINING FROM A PREVIOUS (NON-IA) OIF/OEF 
ASSIGNMENT MUST ALSO ATTEND NIACT IF THERE WAS A 90-DAY OR MORE GAP 
BETWEEN LEAVING AND RE-ENTERING THEATER.  ANY IA OR TAD SAILOR ASSIGNED 
OVER 30 DAYS THAT ATTENDS NIACT BUT DOES NOT DEPLOY WITHIN 90 DAYS WILL 
BE REQUIRED TO ATTEND NIACT AGAIN TO UPDATE HIS/HER COMBAT SKILLS AND 
REVIEW CURRENT ENEMY TTP*S PRIOR TO DEPLOYING.
5.  AS NIACT HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE THE MINIMUM TRAINING OUR SAILORS 
NEED TO SUCCEED IN THESE NON-TRADITIONAL NAVY ROLES, APPROVED 
ATTENDANCE AND 90-DAY UPDATE TRAINING WAIVERS WILL BE RARE AND GRANTED 
BY COMNECC ONLY WHEN RECENT RELEVANT COMBAT SKILLS TRAINING 
SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS THAT OF NIACT.  NECC WILL ACT AS THE APPROVAL 
AUTHORITY FOR ALL WAIVERS IN COORDINATION WITH USFFC.  SUBMIT WAIVERS 
TO COMNECC (N7) VIA GENADMIN MSG WITH SPECIFIC JUSTIFICATION FOR NIACT 
SUBSTITUTION.
6.  PERSONNEL ATTENDING NIACT WILL PROCESS THROUGH NECC NAVCENT DET 
KUWAIT FOR ADMIN PROCESSING AND ACCOUNTING, FUNCTIONAL WEAPONS CHECK, 
AND TACTICAL MOVEMENT COUNTER-IED TRAINING HELD AT CAMP UDARI, KUWAIT.
REFS B AND C ESTABLISHED THE REQUIREMENT TO ENSURE THAT ALL SAILORS 
ORDERED TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN RECEIVE APPROPRIATE TACTICAL MOVEMENT 
COUNTER-IED TRAINING.  NECC, USFFC AND FORSCOM REVALIDATED THE 
REQUIREMENT AND, WITH COMBINED FORCES LAND COMPONENT COMMANDER 
CONCURRENCE, HAVE DETERMINED THAT NIACT TRAINING ALONE CANNOT MEET THE 
REQUIREMENTS OF TACTICAL MOVEMENT COUNTER-IED TRAINING.
7.  POINT OF CONTACT IS LCDR MARTY ANDERSON, COMNECC N71,
(757) 462-4316 X193/DSN 253, OR EMAIL MARTIN.ANDERSON(AT)NAVY.MIL.
