RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN message announces the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Training 
and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) Aviation Command Retention Bonus 
(ACRB), authorized in line with references (a) and (b). 
 
2.  The FY-23 TAR ACRB is designed to retain officers with the capabilities 
and command experience in our primary warfighting missions that are critical 
for the future of our service.  Our cadre of commander (CDR) commanding 
officers (CO) lead our Naval Aviation Enterprise and are the major commanders 
and flag officers of tomorrow.  Their skills and leadership experience are 
essential to the success of the Navy.  The FY-23 TAR ACRB incentivizes 
continued service in follow-on assignments requiring senior aviation leaders. 
    a.  FY-23 TAR ACRB applicants must have screened on the FY-21 through  
FY-23 Aviation Command Screen Board (ACSB) as CO of an eligible operational, 
operational training, or special mission CDR command in order to 
apply.  Eligible commands are those for which the annual ACSB selects 
officers to serve as CO, excluding second-in-grade, sequential, bonus, or 
fleet replacement squadron commands. Consult the FY-23 TAR ACRB program 
information for specific eligibility criteria and limitations at the TAR 
Detailing (PERS-46) Aviation page listed below.  The application opportunity 
commences with the release of this NAVADMIN and closes on 31 August 2023. 
    b.  All FY-23 TAR ACRB contracts will be worth $100,000.Eligible officers 
will receive an initial payment of $34,000 and two anniversary payments of 
$33,000.  Participation in the FY-23 TAR ACRB obligates recipients to 3 years 
of obligated service to include full completion of a post command commander 
(PCC) tour, which may be between 24 and 36 months depending on assignment.   
ACRB obligation ends at the completion of 22 years of service, the projected 
rotation date of the assigned PCC tour, or 3 years from contract acceptance 
date, whichever is later.  ACRB applications for those currently under 
Aviation Department Head Retention Bonus (ADHRB) obligations will be 
accepted, held in abeyance, and activated upon ADHRB contract expiration. 
 
3.  Additional ACRB Information: 
    a.  Officers accepting ACRB contracts are not precluded from 
participating in the career intermission program (CIP).  Officers interested 
in both ACRB and CIP should contact the ACRB program manager and their 
detailer for more information. 
    b.  For further ACRB details, eligibility, and application 
procedures, visit the MyNavy Portal website at
