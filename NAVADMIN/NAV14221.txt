NARR/REF A IS ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NAVY (MANPOWER AND RESERVE AFFAIRS) 
MEMO, AUTHORIZATION FOR PAYMENT OF HARDSHIP DUTY PAY * TEMPO.  REF B IS THE 
UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (PERSONNEL AND READINESS) MEMO, DEPLOYMENT-TO-
DWELL, MOBILIZATION-TO-DWELL POLICY REVISION.//

RMKS/1.  The Navy is in high demand and deployment lengths will remain above 
the historic 6-month norm for some time.  To compensate Sailors for extended 
deployments, effective 17 September 2014, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus has 
authorized Hardship Duty Pay * Tempo (HDP-T) for Sailors, active and reserve, 
who are deployed beyond 220 consecutive days, per reference (a).

2.  HDP-T will be paid at a rate of $495 per month, prorated daily. Sailors 
become eligible for HDP-T when deployed for 221 or more consecutive days in 
an operational deployment.  Operational deployments, as defined in reference 
(b), include scheduled deployments of Carrier Strike Groups, Amphibious 
Readiness Groups, and ships and submarines operating as independent 
deployers, and units and individuals deployed in support of OCONUS 
contingency operations.

3.  For those currently deployed, consecutive days deployed prior to
17 September 2014 will count when determining eligibility for payment, but 
payment will not be made for deployment days before 17 September 2014.  For 
example, if you are deployed 210 consecutive days as of 17 September 2014, 
you will become eligible for HDP-T payment on 28 September 2014, your 221st 
day of consecutive deployment.

4.  Pay systems are being updated to handle payment of HDP-T; projected 
completion is before the end of the year.  Sailors eligible for HDP-T as of 
17 September 2014 will accrue the pay and will receive it once the system 
update is complete.

5.  Consecutive deployment days will be calculated for most Sailors using the 
Personnel Tempo (PERSTEMPO) System.  Detailed instructions on PERSTEMPO 
system use for HDP-T are available in the PERSTEMPO User Manual, available 
at:  http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/support/itempo.

6.  Specific eligibility requirements and guidelines for HDP-T payment will 
be outlined in a forthcoming MILPERSMAN.
