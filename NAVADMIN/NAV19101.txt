SUBJ/CHANGE TO ACCESSION TRAINING FOR RESERVE DIRECT COMMISSION OFFICERS//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Fiscal Year 2020 cancellation of the 
Direct Commission Officer Indoctrination Course (DCOIC) and the associated 
transition to Officer Development School (ODS) and the Limited Duty Officer 
(LDO)/Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) Academy.
The DCOIC provided by Officer Training Command (OTC), Newport, Rhode Island, 
will no longer be offered effective 30 September 2019.
Beginning 1 October 2019, Reserve Direct Commission Officers (DCO) will 
attend the same accession training courses as their Active Component 
counterparts.

2.  The purpose of this change in policy is to ensure standards for Navy 
officer training are applied consistently across all accessions pipelines, in 
order to support increased permeability between the Active and Reserve 
components.

3.  This change to accession training affects all direct accessions into Navy 
Reserve Officer DCO, LDO and CWO programs.
    a.  DCOs.  Reserve DCOs shall attend ODS to complete their accession 
training requirement within 1 year of commissioning.
    b.  LDOs/CWOs.  Reserve LDOs and CWOs shall attend the LDO/CWO Academy to 
complete their commissioning training requirement within
1 year of commissioning.

4.  ODS Training Flexibility.  The accession training requirement for reserve 
DCOs will be attendance of ODS in one continuous 5-week training period.  
However, ODS split option courses have been developed to more adequately 
support civilian professional schedules.  A limited number of split option 
quotas will be available over two separate training periods throughout the 
year.

5.  Points of contact:
    a.  For training program specific questions contact CAPT Lee Newton at 
(847) 688-3400 x443/DSN 792 or via e-mail at lee.newton(at)navy.mil.
    b.  For Reserve policy questions contact CAPT Mike Evans at
(757) 322-6622/DSN 313 or via e-mail at michael.a.evans2(at)navy.mil.

6.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled.
