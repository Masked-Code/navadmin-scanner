SUBJ/NOTICE OF CONVENING FY-20 ACTIVE-DUTY REAR ADMIRAL AND REAR ADMIRAL 
(LOWER HALF) PROMOTION SELECTION BOARDS//

RMKS/1.  The FY-20 Promotion Selection Boards to recommend Navy officers on 
the Active-Duty List serving in the grades of captain and rear admiral (lower 
half) Line and Staff Corps for promotion to the grades of rear admiral (lower 
half) and rear admiral will be convened as follows:
     12 SEP 18 - Unrestricted Line, Acquisition Line Community,
                 Information Warfare Community, Senior Health Care
                 Executive, and Supply Corps Rear Admiral
     24 SEP 18 - Unrestricted Line (URL), Acquisition Line
                 Community, Public Affairs, Information Warfare
                 Community, Medical Corps, Medical Service Corps,
                 Supply Corps, and Civil Engineer Corps Rear Admiral
                 (lower half)
      TBD -      Foreign Expertise (AQD FE1) Rear Admiral (lower
                 half)
      TBD -      Rear Admiral/Rear Admiral (lower half) Selective
                 Early Retirement (if needed)

2.  The Secretary of the Navy has approved the establishment of the 
Acquisition Line Community (ACQ) single competitive category for selection to 
rear admiral (lower half).  All eligible active-duty Navy line captains 
serving in the Unrestricted Line, Engineering Duty, and Aerospace Engineering 
Duty communities with the APM additional qualification designation (AQD) will 
be awarded the A31 AQD and compete for selection to Rear Admiral (lower half) 
as one competitive category in the Acquisition Line Community selection 
board.  Any Unrestricted Line officer with the APM AQD desiring to be 
considered by the Unrestricted Line selection board must request the APM AQD 
be removed from their record by contacting their respective detailer within 
10 days of the release of this NAVADMIN.

3.  The Secretary of the Navy has approved the establishment of the Foreign 
Expertise single competitive category for selection to rear admiral (lower 
half).  All captains serving in the URL, Foreign Area Officer, Oceanography, 
Cryptologic Warfare, Information Professional, and Intelligence communities 
who hold the Foreign Expertise AQD (FE1), and not on a promotion list to rear 
admiral (lower half), will compete for selection by the Rear Admiral (lower
half) Foreign Expertise selection board.  The Foreign Expertise rear admiral 
(lower half) selection board will be held approximately four months after the 
adjournment of the rear admiral (lower half) boards scheduled to convene in 
September 2018.  A NAVADMIN will be released announcing the date of the 
Foreign Expertise selection board and the senior and junior officers eligible 
for consideration.  Officers selected by the Foreign Expertise selection 
board will be assigned to the Foreign Expertise community upon promotion to 
rear admiral (lower half) and will no longer compete for promotion in their 
previous communities.  Deadline for submission of FE1 AQD self- nomination 
packages to Pers-47 to be considered by the FE1 board is
1 November 2018.

4.  NAVADMIN 186/16 required officers to continue to maintain an officer 
photograph in the official service record, but eliminated the requirement to 
display the officer photograph during selection boards.  The Secretary of the 
Navy will now require the display of the officer photograph during all 
Active-Duty and Reserve Flag Officer promotion selection boards, effective 
the FY-20 selection boards.  The point of contact for photo submission to the 
Official Military Personnel File is Records Management and Policy (PERS-313) 
at (901) 874-3407/DSN 882.

5.  The following list indicates the name, Active-Duty List number, and date 
of rank of the senior and junior officers initially eligible (if applicable) 
for consideration for promotion in each competitive category listed as of the 
date of this NAVADMIN.  In addition, those officers, on the Active-Duty List 
and in the same competitive category, who are senior to the senior initially 
eligible officers (or junior eligible officer, if applicable) listed in their 
category are also eligible for consideration.
