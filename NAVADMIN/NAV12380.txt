SUBJ/KEEPING AN EVEN KEEL THIS 2012 HOLIDAY SEASON//

RMKS/1.  AS 2012 WINDS TO A CLOSE, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HARD WORK 
YOU DO TO KEEP OUR NATION SAFE AND THAT CONTINUES TO MAKE OURS THE GREATEST 
NAVY IN THE WORLD.  I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO RECOGNIZE THE FANTASTIC SUPPORT, 
SACRIFICES, AND CONTRIBUTIONS THAT YOUR FAMILIES MAKE EVERY DAY.

2.  WHETHER DEPLOYED FORWARD, OUT TO SEA, OR WORKING HARD ON THE HOME FRONT, 
PLEASE ENSURE YOU ARE TAKING TIME TO RELAX WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS THIS 
HOLIDAY SEASON.  I WISH ALL OF YOU COULD BE HOME WITH FAMILY, BUT KNOW THAT IS 
NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE.
FINDING WAYS TO POSITIVELY ENGAGE WITH OTHERS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE DURING A 
PERIOD THAT CAN BE STRESSFUL FOR MANY.

3.  OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS, THERE HAS BEEN A STEADY STREAM OF 
COMMUNICATIONS ENCOURAGING YOU TO STAY THE COURSE AND KEEP AN EVEN KEEL 
THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS.  YOU HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH INFORMATION TO REDUCE 
HOLIDAY STRESS, WAISTLINES, AND BUDGETS IN ORDER TO NAVIGATE INTO 2013 AND 
WHILE REMAINING RESILIENT.
RESILIENT SAILORS ARE BETTER EQUIPPED - PHYSICALLY, SOCIALLY, SPIRITUALLY, AND 
EMOTIONALLY - TO FACE THE ADDED STRESS OF THE HOLIDAYS AND ARE BETTER PREPARED 
FOR FUTURE CHALLENGES.

4.  IF YOU MISSED OUT, HERE IS A RECAP OF THE NEWSLETTERS, REFERENCES, AND 
PROGRAMS AVAILABLE 24/7, IF YOU NEED A LITTLE EXTRA MOTIVATION OR ASSISTANCE.  
REMEMBER, IT IS A SIGN OF COURAGE TO SEEK HELP WHEN YOU NEED IT AND ADMIRABLE 
TO REACH OUT TO FELLOW SHIPMATES.
       A.  TAKE TIME TO BROWSE THROUGH THE CHIEF OF NAVAL PERSONNEL WEBSITE'S 
(WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL) FRONT PAGE OR SUPPORT AND SERVICES/NAVY PHYSICAL READINESS 
LINK WHERE YOU WILL FIND A NUMBER OF NUTRITION REFERENCES AND ARTICLES TO HELP 
YOU MAKE BETTER CHOICES AT HOLIDAY PARTIES AND MEALS, AND KEEP YOUR EXERCISE 
PROGRAM ON TRACK (TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NAVY OPERATIONAL FUELING SERIES - SEE 
THE NOFFS NUTRITION CARD DECK LINK).  EVEN A WALK AFTER DINNER CAN MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE.
       B.  THERE ARE MULTIPLE REFERENCES AND RESOURCES FOR MONEY MANAGEMENT. 
NAVY'S FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS OFFER FINANCIAL CLASSES AND 
COUNSELING.  MILITARY ONE SOURCE, NAVY'S OPERATIONAL STRESS CONTROL PROGRAM, 
AND NPC'S WEBPAGE ALONG WITH ANY NUMBER OF INTERNET RESOURCES, WHICH HAVE 
HELPFUL TOOLS LIKE THE BUDGET CALCULATOR AT WWW.PRACTICALMONEYSKILLS.COM, CAN 
HELP YOU KEEP YOUR MONEY ON TRACK.  SOMETIMES DONATING YOUR TIME OR A HOMEMADE 
GIFT CAN BE PRICELESS AND HELP YOU MAINTAIN A GUILT-FREE BALANCED BUDGET.
       C.  THIS SUMMER, NAVY'S SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM STARTED THE LIFELINK 
NEWSLETTER WHICH IS ALSO LOCATED UNDER THE SUPPORT AND SERVICES LINK ON THE 
NPC WEBPAGE - JUST ONE OF THE MANY HELPFUL SUICIDE PREVENTION RESOURCES.  ASK, 
CARE, TREAT, AND INTERVENE WITH A SHIPMATE IF YOU RECOGNIZE ANY OF THE SIGNS 
OF SUICIDAL THOUGHTS.
       D.  OPNAV N135 RUNS NAVY'S OPERATIONAL STRESS CONTROL PROGRAM.  GO TO 
HTTP://NAVYNAVSTRESS.COM FOR RESOURCES ON REDUCING STRESS AND ARTICLES ON 
HOLIDAY STRESS AND BUDGETING.
       E.  I ENCOURAGE YOU TO ALSO INVESTIGATE THE VAST RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT 
WWW.MILITARYONESOURCE.MIL; RANGING FROM LEGAL, FINANCIAL, AND COUNSELING 
SERVICES, TO STATE-BY-STATE REFERENCES AND FAMILY PROGRAM RESOURCES.
       F.  MORALE, WELFARE, AND RECREATION (MWR), AND INFORMATION TICKETS AND 
TRAVEL (ITT) ARE OTHER AVENUES ENABLING YOU TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HOLIDAY 
PROGRAMS AND FESTIVITIES.  VOLUNTEER, GET INVOLVED, AND BRING A SAILOR HOME 
FOR A HOLIDAY MEAL.
       G.  BE SAFE AND REMEMBER THE PRINCIPLES OF OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
(ORM) WHILE TRAVELLING, WORKING, OR PERFORMING HOME CHORES.  GO TO NAVY 
KNOWLEDGE ONLINE (WWW.NKO.NAVY.MIL) TO REVIEW ORM PRINCIPLES OR TO ACCESS 
"TRIPS".  TRIPS IS AN ON-LINE, SURVEY-STYLE RISK-ASSESSMENT TOOL THAT HELPS 
SAILORS RECOGNIZE AND MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DRIVING LONG DISTANCES.  
WHEN A RISK ASSESSMENT IS SUBMITTED, THE DESIGNATED SUPERVISOR RECEIVES AN 
EMAIL INFORMING HIM OR HER THAT THERE IS A RISK ASSESSMENT TO REVIEW.  THIS IN 
TURN OFFERS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ACTIVE MENTORING.  TRIPS INCLUDES MISHAP 
SUMMARIES, TRAVEL DIRECTIONS AND MAPS TO THE USERS DESTINATION, ALONG WITH THE 
OPTION TO COMPLETE AND PRINT A LEAVE REQUEST.

5.  IF YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ONE, OR MANY, OF THESE RESOURCES, YOU WILL BE 
ABLE TO NAVIGATE A STEADIER COURSE, AND KEEP A MORE EVEN KEEL THIS HOLIDAY 
SEASON.  BEST WISHES TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON.
