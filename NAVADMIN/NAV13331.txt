RMKS/1. This NAVADMIN announces guidelines for disposition of STRs 
(medical and dental records) to the Veterans Administration Records 
Management Center. Fleet Commanders, Navy Medicine Region 
Commanders, Reserve Commanders, Commanding Officers,
Officers-in-Charge and Navy Medical Department Officers assigned
to Marine Corps commands must ensure compliance with the
requirements and guidelines contained in reference (a).
Reference (b) is MARADMIN 637/13 which contains guidance for
Marine Corps activities.

2. The Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) has established the 
Navy Medicine Records Activity (NMRA). NMRA will perform a Quality 
Assurance review on STRs prior to archiving to the Veterans Affairs.
a. Starting immediately and until 31 December 2013, the separating 
activity that issues the DD-214, Discharge Papers and Separation 
Documents, of all Navy and Marine Corps Service members will forward 
STRs to Navy Medicine Records Activity (NMRA), BUMED Detachment St. 
Louis, 4300 Goodfellow Drive Bldg 103, St. Louis, MO 63120. 
b. Commands are still required to certify and process the STR per 
reference (a) prior to sending to NMRA.

3. Prior to forwarding the STRs to Personnel Support Detachments 
(Navy) or Installation Personnel Administration Centers (IPAC, 
Marine Corps) for processing and inclusion of the DD-214, or 
appropriate discharge orders, medical department personnel shall 
ensure all medical record documentation is collected to include 
any "known" information printed from Composite Health Care System 1
(CHCS) and the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology 
Application (AHLTA) (e.g., laboratory and radiology results), as 
applicable.
a. If a medical record cannot be located, a replacement record shall 
be created per the guidance in the Manual of the Medical Department 
(MANMED) Chapter 16. 
b. If a dental record cannot be located, a replacement dental record
will be created using the separating T2 exam. 
c. The final step to completing an STR disposition is to place the 
DD2963, STR Transfer or Certification form, into the STR jacket. 
d. A non-availability letter will only be needed if a replacement 
dental record cannot be created.  Commanders, Commanding Officers 
and Officers-in-Charge, or their designee (E7 or above) responsible 
for STR processing, will sign as the sender on the NAVPERS 5000/64, 
Records Transmittal form, verifying that each STR listed contains 
the DD2963 or non-availability letter, if applicable. 
e. In the event additional documentation is discovered, the 
separating activity will immediately forward it to the NMRA with 
the DD2963. 

4. Commands located in TRICARE Prime Remote service areas, to 
include OCONUS, shall ensure that Active Duty Service Members 
obtain copies of all civilian medical records prior to separation,
retirement or permanent change of station. Medical record copying
costs will be borne by the TRICARE contractor. For TRICARE 
Overseas Prime Remote enrollees, the TRICARE contractor will 
provide medical record translation services when requested by the 
member. In the event a member is required to pay "out of pocket" 
for medical records copying, they should submit a DD Form 2642, 
TRICARE Claim Form, to the cognizant TRICARE contractor for 
reimbursement. Medical documentation resulting from appointments 
with civilian providers will be incorporated into the member's 
STR per MANMED Chapter 16.

5. Effective 31 December, all MTFs, Clinics, NOSCs, BASs, RASs, 
Stations, Operational and remote forces will send all STRs to 
NMRA at the above address.
a. At this time a complete STR will consist of a medical record, 
dental record, and a DD2963.  
b. Commands will no longer be required to print AHLTA notes as 
there is an AHLTA feature in Health Artifact and Imaging 
Management Solution (HAIMS). Also, upon certifying the medical 
record, all AHLTA notes must be removed from the medical record 
prior to sending to NMRA for scanning. The facility will use the
push button feature to send AHLTA notes to HAIMS prior to mailing
paper STR. If a facility does not have AHLTA, the closest 
facility with AHLTA access must be notified by the command's 
separating medical staff that assistance is needed for this 
feature to be executed. 
c. If the medical record is only made up of AHLTA notes, do not 
scan AHLTA notes. Instead, use the push button feature to transfer 
AHLTA notes into HAIMS, and scan the DD2963 into HAIMS. 
d. Specific guidance for changes to all future STR retirement 
processes will be disseminated by BUMED through training and 
policy.

6. Guidance for archiving STRs is located at:
