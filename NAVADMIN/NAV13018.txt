REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/01MAR11//

AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 3006.1, PERSONNEL ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
CATASTROPHIC EVENTS//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN DISCUSSES THE SEMI-ANNUAL UPDATE/VERIFICATION OF 
PERSONAL INFORMATION IN NAVY FAMILY ACCOUNTABILITY AND ASSESSMENT SYSTEM 
(NFAAS) BY ALL NAVY MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL.  THIS MESSAGE APPLIES TO 
ALL NAVY PERSONNEL, UNIFORMED (ACTIVE AND RESERVE) AND CIVILIAN AND OCONUS 
CONTRACTORS.

2.  ECHELON II COMMANDERS AND ALL REGIONAL COMMANDERS WILL ENSURE WIDEST 
DISSEMINATION TO ALL SUBORDINATE AND TENANT COMMANDS AND DETACHMENTS FOR 
ACTION AS REQUIRED.  NFAAS IS THE SYSTEM UTILIZED BY THE NAVY TO ACCOUNT FOR 
PERSONNEL AND THEIR FAMILIES DURING WIDESPREAD NATURAL OR MANMADE DISASTERS.  
IT IS IMPERATIVE TO HAVE ACCURATE CONTACT INFORMATION OF PERSONNEL AND FAMILY 
MEMBERS TO FACILITATE A QUICK AND ACCURATE MUSTER OF PERSONNEL IN AFFECTED 
AREAS.

3.  LESSONS LEARNED DURING THE RECENT UPDATE/VERIFICATION OF PERSONAL 
INFORMATION HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO ENSURE 
COMPLIANCE WITH UPDATE/VERIFY REQUIREMENTS AND ENHANCE TIMELINESS OF UPDATING 
INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY MEMBERS INFORMATION.  IT IS REQUIRED FOR ALL MILITARY 
PERSONNEL TO UPDATE AND VERIFY CONTACT INFORMATION AND ALL CATEGORIES OF 
DEPENDENTS.  IT IS MANDATORY FOR NON-BARGAINING UNIT CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES TO 
UPDATE THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION.  HOWEVER, PROVIDING DEPENDENTS INFORMATION 
IS VOLUNTARY.  FAILURE TO PROVIDE DEPENDENT INFORMATION MAY EXCLUDE THEM FROM 
RECEIVING POTENTIAL BENEFITS, IF APPLICABLE.
AT THIS TIME BARGAINING UNIT CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES ARE ENCOURAGED TO PROVIDE 
THEIR CONTACT AND DEPENDENT INFORMATION ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS, UNTIL UNION 
NOTIFICATION AND SUBSEQUENT IMPACT AND IMPLEMENTATION BARGAINING TAKES PLACE 
(WHEN APPLICABLE).  OCTOBER CYCLE UPDATES PROVIDED ONLY AN 86 PERCENT UPDATE 
FROM OUR FORCE.
OUR GOAL IS 100 PERCENT UPDATE BY THE CLOSING DATE OF EACH CYCLE.

4.  ALL COMMANDING OFFICERS/OFFICERS-IN-CHARGE WILL ENSURE TIMELY AND ACCURATE 
UPDATES OF NAVY MEMBER AND FAMILY MEMBER CONTACT INFORMATION AS STATED ABOVE.  
COMMANDING OFFICERS/OFFICER-IN-CHARGE WILL ALSO CONTACT THE HUMAN RESOURCES 
OFFICE TO REQUEST APPLICABLE UNION NOTIFICATIONS.  THIS REQUIREMENT ALSO 
INCLUDES OCONUS CONTRACTORS (MUST ENTER ASSOCIATED UIC).  PER REF A, UPDATES 
OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WILL BE VERIFIED AS CURRENT BY 1 APRIL AND 1 OCTOBER 
EACH YEAR.  A REPORT OF THOSE COMMANDS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS NAVADMIN 
WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS FOR REVIEW.  
WE ARE CURENTLY IN THE NEW UPDATE/VERIFY CYCLE.  THIS CYCLE IS NOW IN EFFECT 
AND WILL END ON 31 MARCH 2013.  ALL PERSONNEL MAY LOGON TO NFAAS AND 
UPDATE/VERIFY CONTACT INFORMATION AS REQUIRED.

5.  ADDITIONALLY, EACH COMMAND WILL INSTITUTE POLICIES REQUIRING PERSONNEL TO 
UPDATE THEIR NFAAS DATA DURING THE CHECK-IN AND CHECK- OUT PROCESS AS STANDARD 
PRACTICE.  MILITARY MEMBERS/DEPENDENTS MUST ALSO UPDATE NFAAS IN ANY INSTANCE 
IN WHICH THEY MAKE A PERMANENT CHANGE OF ADDRESS.  CIVILIAN NON-BARGAINING 
UNIT EMPLOYEES MUST UPDATE THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION AND ARE ENCOURAGED TO 
UPDATE THEIR DEPENDANTS INFORMATION ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS WHENEVER THERE IS A 
CHANGE.  CIVILIAN BARGAINING UNIT EMPLOYEES ARE ENCOURAGED TO UPDATE THEIR 
INFORMATION WHENEVER THERE IS A CHANGE.

6.  FOR MILITARY AND CIVILIAN MEMBERS TO UPDATE CONTACT DATA, UTILIZE THE 
NFAAS SITE AT HTTPS://NAVYFAMILY.NAVY.MIL.  LOG IN AND UPDATE MEMBER 
INFORMATION UNDER THE "MY INFO" TAB "CONTACT INFORMATION" SECTION.  UPDATE 
FAMILY MEMBER INFORMATION UNDER THE "MY INFO" TAB "FAMILY MEMBER INFO" 
SECTION.  EDIT MEMBER AND FAMILY MEMBER INFORMATION AS NECESSARY AND VERIFY AS 
CURRENT.  ALL FAMILY MEMBERS ENROLLED IN THE EXCEPTIONAL FAMILY MEMBER PROGRAM 
MUST BE IDENTIFIED AS SUCH.

7.  THE NFAAS SITE CAN ALSO BE ACCESSED FROM ANY ANDROID, IPHONE OR BLACKBERRY 
MOBILE DEVICE'S WEB BROWSER.  ALTHOUGH THE APPLICATION USES THE SAME URL 
ADDRESS AS THE NFAAS WEBSITE, WHEN ACCESSED VIA MOBILE DEVICE, THE SITE WILL 
BE OPTIMIZED TO ALLOW EASY VIEWING AND NAVIGATION.  THE FOLLOWING LIMITED 
CAPABILITIES ARE AVAILABLE VIA THE MOBILE WEB APPLICATION:
    A.  UPDATE SPONSOR CONTACT INFORMATION
    B.  ENTER EVACUATION LOCATION INFORMATION
    C.  ALLOW USERS TO MUSTER
    D.  ALLOW USERS TO COMPLETE A NEEDS ASSESSMENT

8.  COMMANDS CAN VALIDATE CONTACT INFORMATION HAS BEEN VERIFIED BY USING THE 
PERSONNEL TAB IN NFAAS AND USE THE "EXPORT TO EXCEL" OPTION.  COLUMN N 
CONTAINS THE DATE THE CONTACT INFORMATION WAS LAST UPDATED.

9.  A TOOL IS AVAILABLE IN NFAAS TO ALLOW COMMANDS TO "PULL" PERSONNEL INTO 
THEIR UIC.  THIS PREVENTS INFORMATION FROM INCORRECTLY REMAINING IN A PREVIOUS 
UIC AND NOT BEING ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE CURRENT COMMAND WITHIN NFAAS.

10.  POINTS OF CONTACT:
    A.  NFAAS HELP DESK/SPAWAR - (866) 946-9183 OR VIA E-MAIL AT 
NFAAS(AT)SPAWAR.NAVY.MIL.
    B.  NPC EMERGENCY COORDINATION CENTER - (877) 414-5358 OR VIA E-MAIL AT
