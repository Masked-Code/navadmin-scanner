AMPN/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1150.1C, POLICIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES FOR 
THE HOMETOWN AREA RECRUITING PROGRAM, OFFICER HOMETOWN AREA RECRUITING 
PROGRAM, BLUEJACKET HOMETOWN AREA RECRUITING PROGRAM, AND SENIOR MINORITY 
ASSISTANCE TO RECRUITING PROGRAM// 
 
RMKS/1.  In line with reference (a), this NAVADMIN announces the process and 
procedures that govern the Hometown Area Recruiting Program (HARP), Officer 
Hometown Area Recruiting Program (OHARP), and Senior Minority Assistance to 
Recruiting Program (SEMINAR).  In an era of Great Power Competition, these 
programs play a key role in the recruiting of the Sailors of tomorrow in this 
tightening labor market and provide a great opportunity to highlight the 
experiences a candidate can gain from the Navy. 
 
2.  Blue Jacket HARP has been suspended due to the lack of funding, however, 
the remaining programs are still available to eligible officer and enlisted 
personnel to assist in building Navy awareness. 
 
3.  HARP and OHARP return outstanding Navy personnel to their hometowns to 
temporarily assist local recruiters in locating and enlisting or 
commissioning qualified individuals.  SEMINAR provides assistance to the Navy 
in its efforts to recruit more African American, Hispanic and Asian Pacific 
Islander applicants and to enhance the Navy image in these communities. 
 
4.  HARP is a non-funded program in which enlisted personnel return to their 
hometowns for 12 days (beginning on Monday and ending on Friday the following 
week) to assist local recruiters by relating their Navy experiences to their 
peers.  Participants should be prepared to visit high schools, prior places 
of employment and community locations where peers gather to discuss Navy 
opportunities while wearing the uniform of the day.  Service Members who 
participate in the program may do so either on permissive, no-cost temporary 
additional duty (TEMADD) orders or while on leave in conjunction with 
permanent change of station (PCS) orders. 
 
5.  Blackout dates are the week of Thanksgiving, last 2 weeks of December and 
the first week of January.  During these dates, no HARP requests will be 
approved. 
 
6.  Service Members requesting to participate in HARP duty in conjunction 
with PCS orders shall submit HARP requests to Navy Recruiting Command 
(NAVCRUITCOM) (N1) 6-9 months prior to the desired date (before PCS orders 
are finalized).  NAVCRUITCOM (N1) shall submit all approved HARP requests to 
the Service Members detailer, who will place the appropriate accounting 
category code within the no-cost TEMADD orders.  Service Members will not be 
entitled to reimbursement for any travel, transportation, per diem or 
miscellaneous expenses connected with HARP duty.  Participants must obtain 
Administrative Remarks (NAVPERS 1070/613) from the station leading petty 
officer or leading chief petty officer, signed by the commanding officer of 
the Navy Talent Acquisition Group (NAVTALACQGRU) where the Service Member was 
assigned, documenting the Service Members participation in HARP.  Upon 
reporting to the next duty station, such documentation will constitute the 
authority for this duty. 
 
7.  OHARP returns Navy officers to their hometown areas for 14 to 90 days to 
assist officer recruiters in locating individuals for Navy officer 
programs.  Participants should be prepared to accompany the NAVTALACQGRU 
officer recruiters on visits to colleges and universities, centers of 
influence and community events.  They will wear the uniform of the day and 
will be expected to discuss Navy opportunities and career paths.  Command 
career counselors will serve as the command point of contact for program 
participation. 
 
8.  SEMINAR was established to provide assistance to the Navy in its effort 
to recruit more minority applicants and to enhance Navy image in 
underrepresented communities.  SEMINAR temporarily returns highly qualified 
officers and senior enlisted personnel, E6 through O6, to their home 
communities for 20 days to meet with local community leaders, high school and 
college students to discuss the vast educational, career and advancement 
opportunities the Navy offers.
