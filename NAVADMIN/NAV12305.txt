REF/A/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/231503ZMAR10//

REF/B/DOC/OPNAV/4MAR08//

NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 105/10, CHANGES TO EDUCATION PRIORITIES AND MANAGEMENT 
OF OFF-DUTY VOLUNTARY EDUCATION FOR TUITION ASSISTANCE AND NAVY COLLEGE 
PROGRAM FOR AFLOAT COLLEGE EDUCATION.  REF B IS OPNAVINST 1560.9A, VOLUNTARY 
EDUCATION (VOLED) FOR NAVY SAILORS.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE RESTORATION OF TUITION ASSISTANCE (TA) 
FUNDING FOR CLOCK HOUR PROGRAMS AND IMPLEMENTS A CHANGE TO THE POLICY AND 
GUIDELINES PROMULGATED IN REF A.  COMMANDS SHOULD RETAIN THIS NAVADMIN UNTIL 
AN UPDATE TO REF B IS RELEASED.
INDIVIDUALS MAY PARTICIPATE IN A CLOCK HOUR PROGRAM AS OF THE DATE OF THIS 
NAVADMIN PROVIDED THEY MEET ALL TA ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS, ESTABLISH AN 
APPROVED EDUCATION PLAN WITH THEIR NAVY COLLEGE OR VIRTUAL EDUCATION CENTER 
COUNSELOR, AND HAVE RECEIVED AN ELECTRONIC TA VOUCHER PRIOR TO ENROLLING IN OR 
ATTENDING THE FIRST CLOCK HOUR SESSION.  SAILORS MUST MEET THESE PROVISIONS IN 
ORDER TO AVOID PAYING OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES.

2.  NAVY LEADERSHIP REMAINS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES AND FINANCIAL 
ASSISTANCE TO SAILORS AS THEY PURSUE THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS.  CLOCK HOUR 
PROGRAMS PROVIDE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES THAT OFTEN ENHANCE 
SAILORS' SKILLS IN TECHNICAL CAREER FIELDS AND CAN BENEFIT THEM WHEN THEY 
EVENTUALLY RETURN TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  PROPER PLANNING IS KEY TO SUCCESSFUL 
EXECUTION OF THESE EDUCATION PROGRAMS.

3.  TA FUNDING FOR CLOCK HOURS.  NON-COLLEGE DEGREE (NCD) SCHOOLS OFFER A 
VARIETY OF CERTIFICATE AND DIPLOMA PROGRAMS ON A CLOCK HOUR BASIS RATHER THAN 
THROUGH AWARD OF SEMESTER OR QUARTER HOUR CREDITS.
WHILE ALL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS RECEIVING TA FUNDS MUST BE ACCREDITED BY AN 
ORGANIZATION RECOGNIZED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, NAVY WILL ALSO 
USE OBJECTIVE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 
(DVA) FOR APPROVING NCD SCHOOLS AS AN ADDITIONAL STANDARD FOR DETERMINING TA 
FUNDING ELIGIBILITY.
TA FOR CLOCK HOUR PROGRAMS MAY ONLY BE AUTHORIZED FOR A DVA APPROVED PROGRAM.  
THIS REQUIREMENT HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF PROVIDING SAILORS WITH THE OPTION TO 
UTILIZE THE GI BILL TOP-UP PROGRAM TO COVER COSTS THAT EXCEED THE TA CAP FOR A 
GIVEN FISCAL YEAR.  A LIST OF VA APPROVED PROGRAMS CAN BE FOUND ONLINE AT 
HTTP://INQUIRY.VBA.VA.GOV/.

4.  CREDENTIALING FOLLOWING CLOCK HOUR PROGRAMS.  SAILORS ARE STRONGLY 
ENCOURAGED TO PURSUE CLOCK HOUR PROGRAMS THAT PREPARE THEM FOR NAVY 
CREDENTIALING OPPORTUNITIES ONLINE (COOL) FUNDED CERTIFICATION OR LICENSE 
EXAMINATIONS.  CERTIFICATIONS AND LICENSES CAN BE RESEARCHED AT 
WWW.COOL.NAVY.MIL.

5.  INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PLANS.  GIVEN THE DEMANDS ON A SAILOR'S TIME AND THE 
RISING COST OF EDUCATION, IT IS CRITICAL THAT EVERY COURSE TAKEN BE APPLICABLE 
TO THE SAILOR'S LONG-TERM EDUCATIONAL GOALS.  AN INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PLAN 
MUST BE ON FILE WITH THE NAVY COLLEGE OFFICE PRIOR TO ENROLLING IN AND 
ATTENDING THE FIRST NCD CLOCK HOUR COURSE FUNDED WITH TA.

6.  TA FUNDING LEVELS.  100 PERCENT TUITION AND AUTHORIZED FEES, UP TO $250 
PER SEMESTER HOUR, OR $166.67 PER QUARTER HOUR, OR $16.67 PER CLOCK HOUR.  TA 
WILL BE LIMITED TO 16 SEMESTER HOURS, OR 24 QUARTER HOURS, OR 240 CLOCK HOURS 
PER FISCAL YEAR.  BOTH CREDIT AND CLOCK HOURS CAN BE FUNDED BY TA; HOWEVER, 
THE COMBINED TOTAL COST FOR AN INDIVIDUAL SAILOR CANNOT EXCEED THE MAXIMUM 
ALLOWABLE ANNUAL TA CAPS.

7.  LIMIT TO NUMBER OF TA FUNDED CLOCK HOUR PROGRAMS.  IN KEEPING WITH CURRENT 
TA POLICY IMPLEMENTED BY REF B (EDUCATION PLANS WHICH LEAD TO AN ADDITIONAL 
DEGREE AT THE SAME OR LOWER EDUCATION LEVEL WILL NOT BE SUPPORTED THROUGH TA) 
EACH SAILOR MAY ONLY USE TA TO FUND ONE VOCATIONAL/TECHNICAL PROGRAM DURING A 
CAREER THAT AWARDS CREDIT IN CLOCK HOURS.  SAILORS ARE REQUIRED TO DISCUSS 
THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS WITH A NAVY COLLEGE COUNSELOR PRIOR TO ENROLLING IN 
ANY PROGRAM FUNDED BY TA.

8.  CLOCK HOUR PROGRAM COMPLETION.  PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL DEMANDS, COUPLED 
WITH THE ADDED ACADEMIC WORKLOAD, MAY IMPACT A SAILOR'S ABILITY TO 
SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE CLOCK HOUR PROGRAMS.
FAILURES AND WITHDRAWALS REPRESENT LOST OPPORTUNITIES AND POTENTIAL COSTS FOR 
THE SAILOR.  SAILORS WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY IN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING COURSEWORK 
SHALL DISCUSS THEIR OPTIONS WITH NAVY COLLEGE COUNSELORS, ADVISORS FROM THEIR 
ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS, AND THEIR CHAIN OF COMMAND BEFORE DROPPING OR FAILING A 
COURSE, WHICH REQUIRES SAILORS TO REIMBURSE THE FULL COST OF THEIR TA VOUCHER.

9.  FOLLOW-ON ACADEMIC PROGRAMS.  HISTORICALLY, NEARLY HALF OF ALL SAILORS 
PURSUING CLOCK HOUR TRAINING HAVE LATER SOUGHT ACADEMIC DEGREES.  BRIDGING 
TECHNICAL/VOCATIONAL LEARNING WITH ACADEMIC DEGREE TRACKS CAN SOMETIMES BE 
CHALLENGING, AS CLOCK HOUR CREDITS DO NOT TRANSFER INTO SEMESTER HOURS OR 
QUARTER HOURS REQUIRED FOR A COLLEGE DEGREE.  THEREFORE, SAILORS ARE 
ENCOURAGED TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL RANGE OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AVAILABLE.  
THE AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATION CONTINUES TO EVALUATE OUR MILITARY TRAINING, 
RATINGS, AND NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATIONS FOR COLLEGE CREDIT RECOMMENDATIONS.  
THESE CREDITS, COUPLED WITH THE CREDIT BY EXAMINATION PROGRAM OFFERED BY THE 
DEFENSE ACTIVITY FOR NON- TRADITIONAL EDUCATION SUPPORT, NAVY COLLEGE PROGRAM 
FOR AFLOAT COLLEGE EDUCATION, AND TA, AFFORD ALL ELIGIBLE SAILORS THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A COLLEGE DEGREE.  SCHOLARSHIPS ARE AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE 
OF EDUCATIONAL FUNDING FOR SAILORS.  MILITARY COMMUNITY SCHOLARSHIP AND 
FINANCIAL AID EXPLORER (SFEX), ACCESSED AT WWW.MCSFEX.NET AND OPEN TO ALL 
SERVICE MEMBERS AT NO COST, WAS DEVELOPED BY THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS.  
SFEX PROVIDES A LISTING OF OVER 600 SCHOLARSHIPS THAT ARE APPLICABLE FOR THE 
MILITARY.  THE PELL GRANT IS ALSO AVAILABLE TO QUALIFYING MILITARY MEMBERS.  
FREE APPLICATIONS MAY BE COMPLETED ON LINE AT WWW.FAFSA.ED.GOV.

10.  AMPLIFYING INFORMATION IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE NAVY COLLEGE WEBSITE AT: 
WWW.NAVYCOLLEGE.NAVY.MIL.  CONTACT YOUR LOCAL NAVY COLLEGE OFFICE FOR 
ASSISTANCE WITH THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS.

11.  POINT OF CONTACT IS MR. TOM SMITH, NETC N525, AT (850) 452- 7271/DSN 992 
OR VIA E-MAIL AT THOMAS.A.SMITH4(AT)NAVY.MIL.
