RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces further measures to mitigate the spread of 
COVID-19 throughout the Navy enterprise and amplifies DoD and DON references 
(o) and (n) guidance for Navy military members.  It summarizes and repeats 
applicable guidance where appropriate so that this will serve as a one-stop 
information source. 
    1.A.  Background.  The DoD has transitioned to Phase Two Mitigation of 
reference (a), the global campaign in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.  The 
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is now reporting over 
100,000 cases worldwide, to include cases in the U.S.  During the COVID-19 
outbreak, the DoD and Navy will continue to protect and preserve the 
operational effectiveness of forces worldwide in accordance with (IAW) 
references (a) and (b).  Utilizing force health protection guidance (FHPG) 
from the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&R)) 
provided in reference (c) and (m), USNORTHCOM is executing its pandemic plan 
and geographic combatant commanders are executing their supporting pandemic 
plans IAW reference (d).  In compliance with updated USD (P&R) FHPG issued in 
references (e) and (f), Office of Chief Naval Operations (OPNAV) published 
initial reporting guidance supporting DoD response to the COVID-19 outbreak 
in reference (g) and updated that guidance in references (h) and (i). 
    1.B.  Role of the CDC.  As the leading U.S. government Public Health 
Agency, the CDC continues to assess the risk of COVID-19 and to provide 
guidance for those residing in the U.S. and traveling abroad.  Because CDC 
guidance is principally tailored for persons residing in the continental U.S. 
(CONUS), some CDC COVID-19 guidance may have limited applicability for 
commanders, particularly those outside the United States, and is not 
recognized by other sovereign nations.  While DoD continues to follow the 
lead of the CDC, when needed, additional military specific measures are 
authorized to mitigate risk to U.S. forces stationed or deployed around the 
world, and to protect Service Members, DoD civilian employees, and their 
family members.  USD (P&R) FHPG issued in reference (m) provides guidance for 
DoD personnel traveling during the novel coronavirus outbreak. 
    1.C.  CDC Travel Health Advisories.  The CDC provides travel health 
advisories at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html.  
The levels of advisories are noted below and will be referenced in this 
NAVADMIN (note that CDC warning levels DO NOT apply to 
CONUS): 
Level 1  Watch, practice usual precautions (risk of limited community 
transmission) 
Level 2  Alert, practice enhanced precautions (sustained (ongoing) community 
transmission) 
Level 3  Warning, avoid nonessential travel (widespread sustained (ongoing) 
transmission) 
    1.D.  Department of the Navy (DON) Civilian Guidance.  The DON civilian 
workforce  more than 220,000 strong  plays an integral role in supporting our 
Sailors and building, manning and maintaining our ships and submarines.  
Working shoulder to shoulder with our military members, it is imperative to 
have alignment between DON civilian and military COVID-19 policy and 
guidance.  To avoid any ambiguity, DON civilian guidance is contained in 
reference (n). 
    1.E.  Military Health Protection Guidance.  The Secretary of Defense 
(SECDEF) has provided explicit Force Health Protection Guidance in both 
references (c) and (m) which is more restrictive than CDC guidance.  
Commanders must read both documents in their entirety and ensure they are 
following the Service Member actions spelled out in this guidance.  Local 
Commanders can be more restrictive based on Command location, local community 
transmission, risk to mission and risk to force.  Each and every Sailor must 
ensure they proactively manage and minimize their personal risk to exposure, 
and that of their families.  Commands are charged with ensuring they track 
and monitor each Sailor and aggressively follow SECDEF guidance in these 
references. 
 
2.  Mission.  All commands will take specific actions to mitigate the spread 
of COVID-19 worldwide and adhere to the policies and reporting requirements 
contained in this NAVADMIN. 
 
3.  Policy.  In order to maintain force health protection, readiness of the 
force and mitigate the risk of transmission among personnel, the Secretary of 
Defense directed a stop movement to affected countries and areas effective 13 
Mar 2020 in reference (o).  This includes all forms of travel to include 
Permanent Change of Station, Temporary Duty and leave.  This order will 
remain in effect until 13 May 2020, 60 days after implementation: 
    3.A.  Permanent Change of Station (PCS).  Service Members and dependents 
under OCONUS PCS orders to locations designated CDC COVID-19 Warning Level 3 
or CDC COVID-19 Alert Level 2 will follow the guidance in section 3.A. of 
this NAVADMIN.  Note that CDC warning levels DO NOT apply to CONUS.  CONUS 
PCS moves may continue for now, UNODIR. 
          3.A.1.  PCS orders to or from CDC COVID-19 Warning Level 3 
locations.  Service Members and their dependents under PCS orders to or from 
a CDC COVID-19 Warning Level 3 location will stop movement.  This policy 
applies to currently designated CDC COVID-19 Warning Level 3 locations, or 
those designated Level 3 at a later date. 
                  3.A.1.a.  Service Members who have detached from their 
parent command prior to the date of this NAVADMIN and are in transit are 
directed to contact Navy Personnel Command (NPC) for follow-on guidance per 
paragraph 5.A.  NPC is standing by to address each specific case and will 
authorize entitlements based on current location and situation. 
                  3.A.1.b.  Detaching and gaining commands shall make every 
effort to contact affected Service Members enroute to/from their command to 
advise them of the contents of this message. 
          3.A.2.  PCS orders to CDC COVID-19 Alert Level 2 locations.  
Service Members under PCS orders to a CDC COVID-19 Alert Level 2 location 
will execute orders.  Dependents of Service Members executing accompanied PCS 
orders to a CDC COVID-19 Alert Level 2 location will delay travel to the CDC 
COVID-19 Alert Level 2 location until 13 May 2020, 60 days after 
implementation.  This policy applies to currently designated CDC Alert 
Level 2 locations and those designated at a later date.  For Service Members 
with dependents, non-concurrent dependent travel entitlements will vary 
depending on each case.  NPC is standing by to address each specific case and 
authorized entitlements based on current location and situation. 
    3.B.  Other Official Travel (Meetings, Conferences, Site Visits, etc). 
          3.B.1.  All other official travel by Service Members to or from a 
country designated as CDC COVID-19 Warning Level 3, will require an exception 
IAW paragraph 3.E.  All other official travel by Service Members, including 
within CONUS, is strongly discouraged.  If required, official travel must be 
determined to be mission essential and will be approved by the first flag 
officer or senior executive service member (SES) in the chain of command of 
the traveler. 
          3.B.2.  All OCONUS travel, other than those countries designated as 
CDC COVID-19 Warning Level 3, for Selected Reserve personnel conducting 
annual training or other duty shall be IAW Geographic Combatant Commander 
(CCDR) or Navy Component Commander COVID-19 policy.  Selected Reserve travel 
to a CDC COVID-19 Warning Level 3 location shall be in accordance with this 
NAVADMIN. 
    3.C.  Travel for Official Training. 
          3.C.1.  Service Members or initial accessions travel from an OCONUS 
CDC COVID-19 Alert Level 2 location to attend formal training in CONUS must 
be determined to be mission essential and will be approved by the first flag 
officer or SES in the chain of command of the traveler, require advance 
coordination with the training command and will comply with Navy Component 
Commander guidance concerning pre- and post- travel medical screening and 
reception procedures to include restriction of movement (ROM). 
          3.C.2.  Service Members or initial accessions traveling from an 
OCONUS CDC COVID-19 Warning Level 3 location to attend formal training in 
CONUS require an exception as outlined in paragraph 3.E. and will coordinate 
with the training command prior to approval. 
          3.C.3.  Service Members currently in training who are from a CDC 
COVID-19 Alert Level 2 or higher location are authorized to complete training 
and return to their parent command. 
    3.D.  Personal Leave and Liberty.  Commanders and commanding officers 
shall carefully review OCONUS/CONUS leave and liberty plans to minimize 
personnel traveling to locations that have declared a public health 
emergency, even within CONUS.  These decisions should be based on local 
community transmission, risk to mission and risk to force, as well as 
personal hardship or family concerns of the individual.  Approval authority 
for leave requests to areas for which a travel advisory has been issued by 
the CDC for countries other than COVID-19 Warning Level 3, is the first flag 
officer or SES in the chain of command.  Leave or personal travel to a COVID-
19 Warning Level 3 Country requires a waiver as outlined in paragraph 3.E. 
    3.E.  Exceptions. 
          3.E.1.  Individuals pending retirement or separation within the 
next 60 days are exempt from this stop movement. 
          3.E.2.  Commanding officers and officers in charge may request an 
exception to paragraphs 3.A. through 3.D. in the following cases:  (1) 
determined to be mission essential, (2) necessary for humanitarian reasons, 
or (3) warranted due to extreme hardship.  Mission-essential travel refers to 
work that must be performed to ensure the continued operations of mission 
essential functions, as determined by the local Commander. 
                  3.E.2.a.  Navy Personnel Command (PERS-4) is authorized to 
approve or deny stop movement exceptions for PCS travel in paragraphs 3.A. 
and 3.C.  Approvals of exception requests shall be made via message traffic 
to all concerned and will specify whether dependents are authorized to 
accompany the Service Member.  OCONUS Commanders endorsement is required.  
Upon receipt of an approved exception, Transaction Service Center or 
Personnel Support Detachment/personnel offices will process the Service 
Member for transfer to the gaining command.  Send all exception requests to 
pers451(at)navy.mil with the subject line PCS EXCEPTION REQUEST.  Exception 
request formats will be provided by PERS-4 and posted on MyNavy 
Portal.  Service Members who are granted an exception and are traveling from 
a CDC COVID-19 Warning Level 3 or Alert Level 2 location will receive 
guidance from NPC concerning Navy Component Commander pre- and post-travel 
medical screening and reception procedures to include ROM. 
                  3.E.2.b.  The first flag officer or SES in the chain of 
command is authorized to approve or deny stop movement exceptions for 
official travel in paragraph 3.B., and for official training, not associated 
with a PCS, in paragraph 3.C. and for leave in paragraph 3.D.  Service 
members who are granted an exception and are traveling from a CDC COVID-19 
Warning Level 3 or Alert Level 2 location will comply with Navy Component 
Commander guidance concerning pre- and post- travel medical screening and 
reception procedures to include ROM. 
    3.F.  Actions upon return from a CDC COVID-19 Alert Level 2 or higher 
location or if in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 infection. 
          3.F.1.  Service Members who travel or have traveled in the prior 14 
days to or through a CDC COVID-19 Warning Level 3 or Alert Level 2 location 
will immediately notify their chain of command and be placed in a 14 day ROM 
status.  Immediate supervisors will not require Service Members to report to 
their duty location or otherwise disregard the ROM.  Service Members will 
comply with reference (m) and Navy Component Commander guidance concerning 
pre- and post-travel medical screening and reception procedures to include 
ROM.  Commanders may, pursuant to DoD and Navy regulations and policies, 
authorize telework opportunities, permissive TAD/TDY or work from home as 
necessary. 
          3.F.2.  Service Members who have had close contact with someone 
with a confirmed COVID-19 infection and feel sick with a fever, cough or 
difficulty breathing shall: 
                  3.F.2.a.  Inform their Senior Medical Department 
Representative immediately. 
                  3.F.2.b.  Seek medical care immediately.  Before going to 
the office of a doctor or emergency room, call ahead to provide recent travel 
locations and symptoms.

hands) when coughing or sneezing. 
    3.G.  Conferences.  All Navy personnel shall maximize the conduct of 
virtual conferences, meetings and classes to the fullest extent.  Holding 
conferences are discouraged and must be approved by a Navy Component 
Commander, Deputy Fleet Commander, Task Force Commander or Navy Region 
Commander charged with hosting the conference. 
    3.H.  General Health Guidance.  Compliance with CDC guidance is critical 
to minimize the spread of COVID-19.  All personnel shall: 
          3.H.1.  Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 
seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after 
blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.  If soap and water are not readily 
available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent 
alcohol.  Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. 
          3.H.2.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick. 
          3.H.3.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. 
          3.H.4.  Stay home when you are sick. 
          3.H.5.  Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the

          3.H.8.  Minimize meetings of more than five persons. 
          3.H.9.  Practice social distancing. 
          3.H.10.  Minimize attendance at large group gatherings outside of 
the workplace (for example concerts and sporting events with large 
attendance). 
    3.I.  Supplemental Guidance for Commanders. 
          3.I.1.  IAW reference (m), Commanders should identify and track all 
Service Members who travel or have a history of travel in the prior 14 days 
to, through or from a CDC COVID-19 Alert Level 2 or Warning Level 3 OCONUS 
location.  This includes travel by military or commercial means as well as 
private conveyance and includes all forms of travel to include PCS, temporary 
duty and leave.  Commanders shall ensure Service Members implement the 
following actions for the next 14 days: 
                  3.I.1.a.  Implement self-observation, i.e., take 
temperature twice a day and remain alert for fever (>100.4 degrees F or 38 
degrees C) and remain alert for fever, cough or difficulty breathing. 
                  3.I.1.b.  To the extent possible implement social 
distancing, i.e., remain out of congregate settings, avoid mass gatherings 
and maintain 6 feet or 2 meter distance from others when possible. 
                  3.I.1.c.  If individuals feel feverish or develop measured 
fever, cough or difficulty breathing, immediately self-isolate, limit contact 
with others and seek advice by telephone from the appropriate healthcare 
provider to determine whether medical evaluation is required. 
          3.I.2.  Commanders will adhere to DoD guidance for personnel 
traveling during the novel coronavirus outbreak per reference (m) to include 
COVID-19 screening at overseas military transportation terminals per 
reference 
          (j).  Commanders will review the supplemental risk-based measures 
and observe the operational risk level mitigation actions for COVID-19 
outlined in reference (b). 
          3.I.3.  For individuals traveling OCONUS to OCONUS, Commanders will 
ensure travel is mission essential and follow the guidance listing in 
reference (o) if compelling exceptions are necessary.  Military air crew are 
exempt from the requirements in this NAVADMIN, but will ensure they actively 
practice social distancing and prudent measures to mitigate potential contact 
and COVID-19 transmission. 
          3.I.4.  Commanders will comply with status of forces agreements 
when applicable. 
          3.I.5.  Consider measures to place mission essential shore staffs 
on alternating day or port/starboard work rotations. 
          3.I.6.  Use maximum latitude to authorize telework, liberal leave, 
permissive TDY as necessary to minimize spread within your teams. 
          3.I.7.  Implement social distancing techniques for any meetings you 
conduct. 
 
4.  Regular Reporting.  For CONUS commands, ensure your point of contacts

consolidation and subsequent reporting to OPNAV.  For OCONUS commands, ensure 
your POCs submit accurate and timely COVID-19 daily reports and CCIRs to 
Fleet Commanders for consolidation and subsequent reporting to OPNAV.  Navy 
commands will report the following CCIRs immediately through their chain of 
command and via OPREP where appropriate: 
    4.A.  Any confirmed cases of COVID-19 among Navy Service Members, DoD 
civilians, or military family members.  In addition, a report should be made 
if a command learns of a confirmed case with an assigned contractor, 
    4.B.  The death of a Navy Service Member, DoD civilian, Navy contractor 
or family member due to COVID-19, 
    4.C.  Any shortage of medical personal protective equipment (PPE) or test 
kits, 
    4.D.  Installation or facility closures, 
    4.E.  Installation or facility is unable to meet isolation requirements, 
    4.F.  Any change to health protection condition (HPCON). 
 
5.  Points of Contact. 
    5.A.  Sailor Support.  Service Members with questions regarding this stop 
movement or entitlements for PCS travel should contact the MyNavy Career 
Center (1-833-330-6622) or email ASKMNCC(AT)NAVY.MIL.  Detailers are ready to

for its Sailors, civilian employees and family members. However, all members 
of the Navy family must do their part by adhering to CDC guidelines as they 
relate to basic hygiene and human interaction.  The Navy will remain focused 
on meeting our global commitments while also ensuring the health and well-
being of our Service Members, Navy civilians and our families.
