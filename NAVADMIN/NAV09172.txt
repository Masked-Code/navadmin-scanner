RMKS/1.  CONGRATULATIONS TO EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ADVISORS AND COMMAND 
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY OFFICERS ACROSS THE NAVY.  IN THE 2008 DEFENSE EQUAL 
OPPORTUNITY MANAGMENT INSTITUTE (DEOMI) ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE SURVEY 
(DEOCS) REPORT, NAVY SCORED HIGH MARKS IN THIS IMPORTANT, SELF-
ASSESSMENT PROCESS.  THIS SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT THE CALIBER OF SAILORS 
AND CIVILIANS IN OUR NAVY TOTAL FORCE, AND THE TOP NOTCH PROFESSIONALS 
WHO LEAD THEM.
2.  THE DEOCS SURVEY IS ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY-USED SURVEY TOOLS 
EMPLOYED BY THE NAVY.  ADMINISTERED BY THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT AT 
DEOMI, DEOCS IS FUNDED BY THE NAVY EQUAL OPPORTUNITY (NEO) OFFICE AND 
CAN BE ACCESSED ON LINE OR VIA HARD COPY.  WELL ESTABLISHED AS BOTH 
VALID AND RELIABLE, THIS USER FRIENDLY SURVEY PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT 
INSIGHT INTO ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND UNIT COHESIVENESS.  TOOLS 
HAVE BEEN ADDED TO AFFORD INDIVIDUAL COMMANDS THE ABILITY TO TAILOR 
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS TO MEET THEIR NEEDS.  DEOCS PARTICIPATION IS ALWAYS 
VOLUNTARY AND ANONYMOUS.  SURVEY RESULTS PROVIDE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE 
IMPACT COMMAND AND NAVY POLICIES AND PROGRAMS ARE HAVING TO FOCUS 
RESOURCES ON AREAS OF GREATEST CONCERN.  
TO THAT END, WE ENCOURAGE EACH COMMAND TO FULLY UTILIZE THE TOOLS 
AVAILABLE TO ASSESS AND MAINTAIN A HEALTHY COMMAND CLIMATE.
3.  THE SUCCESS WE ENJOY IS IN PART A RESULT OF NAVY'S COMMITMENT TO 
PROMOTE A HEALTHY COMMAND CLIMATE AND ACTIVELY MONITOR RESULTS ON A 
RECURRING BASIS.  REF A SPECIFIES THAT EACH COMMAND WILL CONDUCT A 
COMMAND CLIMATE ASSESSMENT WITHIN 90 DAYS OF CHANGE OF COMMAND, THEN 
ANNUALLY THEREAFTER.  A TRIANGULATION METHODOLOGY OF ASSESSMENT WAS 
ADOPTED BY THE NAVY IN 2006, WHEREBY EACH ASSESSMENT MUST EMPLOY AT 
LEAST THREE DATA COLLECTION TOOLS, DRAWN FROM AMONG SURVEYS, FOCUS 
GROUPS, INTERVIEWS, RECORDS REVIEWS, ETC.
4.  QUESTIONS REGARDING THE DEOCS ARE ANSWERED ON THE ORGANIZATIONAL 
ASSESSMENT LINK:  HTTP://WWW.DEOMI.ORG/ORGASSESSMENT ON THE DEOMI 
RESOURCE NETWORK (DRN) WEBSITE, HTTP://WWW.DEOMI.ORG/DRN, AND BY THE
