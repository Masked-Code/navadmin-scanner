INFRASTRUCTURE, AND A SUBSEQUENT REPORT TO THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL 
OPERATIONS, FLEET READINESS AND LOGISTICS (CNO N4) WITHIN THE NEXT 60 
DAYS. INTENT OF THE REVIEW IS FOR EACH WE/P TO LOOK CLOSELY AT CURRENT 
AND NEAR TERM OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS PROCESSES THAT CAN BE CHANGED TO 
ELIMINATE EXCESS FACILITIES AND SHORE FOOTPRINT, REDUCE THE CARRYING 
COST OF TODAY'S INFRASTRUCTURE, AND QUICKLY DRIVE OUR NAVY TO A MORE 
EFFECTIVE, EFFICIENT GLOBAL SHORE INFRASTRUCTURE DELIVERED AT LOWEST 
LIFE-CYCLE COST.

REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THEIR RESPECTIVE ENTERPRISE/DOMAIN OVER THE NEXT 5 
YEAR PERIOD AND IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR INFRASTRUCTURE REDUCTION.

CONOPS, FORCE LAYDOWN, SURGE REQUIREMENTS, BUSINESS PROCESSES, AND
