SUBJ/COMMAND OPERATION REPORT UPDATE FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2015//

REF/A/DOC/CNO/21MAY2012//

AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 5750.12K, ANNUAL COMMAND OPERATIONS REPORT//
AMPN/REF A TASKS ALL NAVY COMMANDS WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF SUBMITTING THE ANNUAL COMMAND OPERATIONS REPORT.//

RMKS/1.  Per reference (a), submission of Command Operations Reports (COR) is 
every Commander's responsibility.  The COR is the only overall record of a 
command's operations and achievements that is permanently retained.  As a 
permanent record of the federal government, CORs ultimately are held by the 
National Archives and Records Administration in perpetuity.  COR submissions 
were due 2 March, with the exception that deployed units may defer their 2015 
submission to 30 days following return from deployment.  As of 1 April 2016, 
737 out of 1910 required CORs for CY 2015 have been submitted.

2.  CORs are vital records which document the Navy's operational and 
administrative activities for each calendar year. Important functions and 
uses of these reports include the following:
    a.  Documenting the Navy's role throughout history from operations such 
as Blue Bat, Urgent Fury, and Praying Mantis, to more recent/current 
operations such as Inherent Resolve, Odyssey Dawn, and Enduring Freedom.
    b.  Provide required documentation to support Navy legal teams for 
claims/litigation involving the Navy.
    c.  Supporting veterans' claims with Department of Veterans Affairs to 
include injury and Agent Orange exposure, as examples.  For many of our 
Sailors, the COR and ship deck logs are used to establish the presence of a 
unit at an event. Individual personnel and medical records then establish the 
connection of the individual to the unit/event.  This is a vital use of these 
records to support those who have served.
    d.  Providing Commanders with access to their own unit's operational 
history including lessons learned, future planning data, operational metrics, 
and other valuable information.
    e.  Critical informational support for Navy leadership to develop future 
Navy operational needs and policies, manage ongoing program requirements, and 
determine budget priorities.
    f.  Developing a sense of history, esprit de corps, tradition, and 
professionalism within individual units and across the Navy.

3.  The COR should be submitted electronically to Naval History and Heritage 
Command (NHHC).  Reference (a) and the electronic form may be downloaded from 
NHHC's website (http://www.history.navy.mil/about-us/instructions-and-forms/
submit-a-command-operations-report.html).  There is also a short document 
available on the webpage entitled "Tips for Writing a Command Operations 
Report" that provides examples of what is most helpful to historians and 
researchers. Questions concerning the report should be directed to
email:  NHHC_COR(at)navy.mil or archives(at)navy.mil,
comm:  (202) 433-3224, or DSN:  94-433-3224.  CORs classified no higher than 
the Secret level can be submitted using SIPRNET at:
NHHC_COR(at)navy.smil.mil.  NHHC currently has no means of receiving CORs 
classified above the Secret level by email. For commands that need to submit 
a COR above the Secret level, refer to directions cited in reference (a).

4.  Point of Contact:  Ms. Suzanne Scott, at comm: (202) 685-0604 or email:  
NHHC_COR(at)navy.mil.
