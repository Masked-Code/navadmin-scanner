RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits enlisted Sailor applications for 
enrollment into the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) 24-month Master 
of Science in Undersea Warfare Program.  In line with references (a) 
and (b), this opportunity is one of many efforts to increase 
Explosive Ordnance Disposals Undersea Warfare capabilities for the 
Navy, while building professional senior leaders in the underwater 
domain.  The Undersea program offers students the opportunity to 
study the fundamental principles which apply to the design, 
performance, and employment of sensors, unmanned vehicles, and 
tactics in the undersea environment.  The program combines 
electrical and mechanical engineering, mathematics, oceanography, 
physics, and operations research into a multi-disciplinary program 
of study. 
 
2.  Selectee will be assigned to NPS as a full-time student under 
permanent change of station (PCS) orders to Monterey, CA, with a 
September 2023 start.  As a full-time student, the Sailor will be 
required to carry a full academic load year-round.  Degree 
requirements should be completed in 24 months. 
 
3.  At this time, the program is only available to Active-Duty 
Sailors in the Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) technician 
rating who meet the following criteria: 
    a.  Must possess a baccalaureate degree from an institutionally 
accredited school.  Your undergraduate degree program must include a 
calculus sequence and a calculus-based physics sequence.  Sailors 
not meeting the academic requirements for direct input may enter the 
program early for a one or two quarter refresher of math and/or 
physics as required. 
    b.  Must be an EOD Technician, a senior chief petty officer (E8) 
or above, company and/or troop leading chief petty officer milestone

with no more than 24 YOS. 
    c.  Selected Sailors must complete active obligated service 
(OBLISERV) requirements in line with reference (c).  OBLISERV is 
computed from the NPS class convening date.  Prior to receiving PCS 
orders to NPS, selected Sailors must OBLISERV for a period of 72 
months (6 years).  If reenlistment and/or obtainment of OBLISERV 
prior to transfer will cause potential monetary loss, the Sailor may 
qualify for the following OBLISERV option:  NAVPERS 1070/613, 
Administrative Remarks, entry in lieu of hard OBLISERV in line with 
reference (c). 
    d.  Must be within physical fitness assessment (PFA) standards
