SUBJ/Navy Reserve 103rd Anniversary//

RMKS/1.  Thank you to the men and women of the Navy Reserve for the work they 
do to make our Navy so strong.  As the Navy Reserve celebrates its 103rd 
year, it remains an agile and lethal force focused on delivering relevant 
operational capability and providing strategic depth.

2.  Reserve Sailors have served in every major conflict our nation has 
fought.  The Navy Reserve was established on March 3rd, 1915 in response to 
the outbreak of World War I.  During that war, Reserve Sailors comprised 
nearly 84 percent of the Navy's fighting force.  Throughout its history, the 
Navy Reserve has been proud to count five future U.S. presidents and 15 
recipients of the Medal of Honor among its ranks.  Since 9/11 the Navy 
Reserve has fulfilled over 80,000 mobilizations in key regions around the 
globe as part of our Total Force.

3.  Today, the men and women of our Navy Reserve continue to play a major 
role in keeping America safe.  The sacrifices of all Navy Reservists, along 
with those of their families and employers, are an essential part of our Navy 
Team.  Together we succeed and maintain maritime superiority around the 
globe.  Happy 103rd Birthday Navy Reserve!

4.  Released by ADM J. M. Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations.//
