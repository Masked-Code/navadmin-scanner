RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces Phase Three of permanent change of station 
(PCS) move improvements offered through MyPCS Mobile.
Reference (a) announced plans to improve the PCS experience for Sailors and 
their families.  Included in the initial Phase was the launch of MyPCS 
Mobile, which provides Sailors a personalized PCS checklist on a mobile-
enabled website accessible on personal government mobile devices, tablets, 
laptops and desktops.
Reference (b) announced Phase Two which included the rollout of Lean Orders 
and the PCS Entitlements Calculator.  Reference (c) announced the optional 
use of the government travel charge card during PCS travel for a pilot 
population.

2.  MyPCS Travel Voucher.  Phase Three introduces a fully automated and 
electronic travel voucher capability for Sailors available on personal and 
government mobile devices, tablets, laptops and desktops.  During a move, 
Sailors can upload images of receipts using their mobile device, complete a 
user-friendly travel voucher prepopulated with basic information available 
from their record, electronically sign the travel voucher and make it 
available electronically to their Command Pay and Personnel Administrator
(CPPA) for review and release for payment by the Travel Processing Center 
(TPC).  The following capabilities are now available on MyPCS Mobile:
    a.  Sailors will be able to:
        (1) Create a travel voucher for member only, member and dependents, 
or dependents only
        (2) Review and edit personal information
        (3) Enter the travel itinerary
        (4) Add expense(s) for reimbursement (to include the images of 
supporting documentation (e.g. receipts) uploaded from a mobile device)
        (5) Print and save the travel voucher
        (6) Acknowledge the voucher via electronic signature and 
electronically submit to their CPPA.
    b.  The CPPA, using their desktop, will be able to:
        (1) View a command list of pending travel vouchers
        (2) View a travel voucher under a Travel Voucher Wizard including:
            (a) Pertinent Sailor information
            (b) Travel/payment information
            (c) Dependent voucher
            (d) Travel itinerary
            (e) Reimbursement items and supporting documentation
            (f) Sailor acknowledgment
        (3) Approve a travel voucher as the Approving Official
        (4) Recycle a travel voucher - send back to the Sailor for correction
        (5) Print and save the travel voucher
        (6) Upload the approved travel voucher into the Transaction Online 
Processing System (TOPS) for processing at the TPC.
Ultimately, with a future capability release, the CPPA will be able to 
forward electronically the approved voucher to the TPC within the integrated 
Navy Personnel and Pay (NP2) system itself.

3.  Similar to the other components of MyPCS Mobile, the MyPCS Mobile Travel 
Voucher can be accessed using any mobile device.  With this new capability, 
Sailors can now navigate the PCS move experience via their mobile browser 
using commercial-grade Multi- Factor Authentication (MFA) credentialing, 
which enables CAC-free access.  MyPCS Mobile Travel Voucher completes the 
end-to-end support this tool provides Active Duty Sailors and their families 
during the PCS move process and is a significant addition to a growing 
toolbox that empowers Sailors with the information and resources needed to 
improve how they navigate Navy career and life events like a PCS move.

4.  As MyPCS mobile capability expands, the options to access appropriate 
online resources for Sailors and command representatives also expand.  CPPAs 
who function as the Approving Official for travel vouchers should acquaint 
themselves with all available training resources.  The 
agency/command/activity granting the CPPAs Travel Vouchers or Sub voucher 
approving authority (Departmental Accountable Official) shall be documented 
using the Appointment/Termination Record Authorized Signature (DD Form 577).
CPPAs, using their desktop, can access the MyPCS training material under the 
MyPCS User Productivity Kit (UPK) from the following locations:

    a.  The Navy App Locker:  https://www.applocker.navy.mil
    b.  MyNavy Portal (MNP):  https://www.mnp.navy.mil

5.  Sailors are encouraged to review these new features in MyPCS Mobile or 
MNP regardless of transient status. Sailors and families are also encouraged 
to download the MyNavy Family application to find authoritative information 
to assist in navigating various aspects of military life.  Go to the Navy 
application locker at https://www.applocker.navy.mil.

6.  Contact MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) for any issues or to provide feedback 
at 833-330-MNCC/6622 or via e-mail at ask MNCC(at)navy.mil.
