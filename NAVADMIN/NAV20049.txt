RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and announces the renewal of the 
Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Senior Enlisted and Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) 
Critical Skills Retention Bonus (CSRB) Program.  The NSW CSRB is part of the 
overarching effort of the Navy to size, shape and stabilize the force.

2.  Program Overview.  This bonus is authorized under reference (b).
Specific critical Navy enlisted classifications (NEC) and approved award 
levels have been prescribed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Personnel and Readiness).  The Naval Special Warfare Enlisted Community 
Manager (BUPERS-324) will act as the NSW CSRB program manager.  All 
applications for this bonus will be submitted to the program manager for 
processing and tracking.  By law, a Service Member may receive no more than 
200,000 dollars in CSRB monies over a career.  Selective reenlistment bonus 
awards are not included in that cap.  The eligibility criteria stated in this 
NAVADMIN can be reduced at any time by the program manager based on the needs 
of the NSW community.

3.  Eligibility.  NSW senior enlisted Service Members with NECs O26X or O52X,

completion of the agreement.  Enlisted Service Members must reenlist or 
extend their enlistment contract, soft end of active obligated service, for a

6.  Program Execution
    a.  Service Members should submit requests for NSW CSRB to the program 
manager 60 to 180 days prior to entering into a NSW CSRB contract via their 
chain of command.  If operational commitments limit the ability to submit 
CSRB applications via this manner, commands should submit requests through 
their immediate superior in the chain of command who can submit the request 
to the program manager.
    b.  Upon acceptance of an agreement of the Service Member by the program 
manager, the amount of the bonus becomes fixed and the Service Member incurs 
a firm service obligation.
    c.  Service Members will receive the bonus in a lump sum payment, 
effective from the date of contract execution.
    d.  CSRB requests for personnel who are being processed for disciplinary 
action, NEC removal or restoration will be held in abeyance pending final 
resolution.

7.  Payment Processing.  CSRB approval does not currently update the Defense 
Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) of the intent of the Sailor to reenlist.  
Until the DJMS can be programmed to accept CSRB reenlistment payments, manual 
processing is required.  Payment should post to the account of the member by 
the second pay period following the day the CSRB program manager receives 
notification of reenlistment or CWO letter of intent.  Master Military Pay 
Account (MMPA) must reflect contract or obligated service for enlisted 
Service Members and tax-free status (if applicable) must post to MMPA for 
both enlisted and officers prior to final payment.

8.  Application.  The following documents are required:
    a.  60-180 days prior to contract:
        (1) Letter of the Service Member requesting a NSW CSRB contract
        (2) COs endorsement letter
    b.  Prior to payment, Service Members will submit a copy of reenlistment 
contract and/or extension agreement with proof of tax- free status, if 
applicable.
