3.  For promotion to the grade of lieutenant, an All-Fully-Qualified-Officers 
List (AFQOL) consisting of those officers recommended for promotion on their 
most recent fitness reports will be sent to the Secretary, who will certify 
the AFQOL and forward the list to the Secretary of Defense.  Those officers 
determined not fully qualified for promotion will be omitted from the AFQOL, 
constituting a Failure of Selection (FOS).  The all-fully-qualified (AFQ) 
standard applies to all competitive categories.  The AFQ standard will also 
be utilized for any officers administratively missed when the original lists 
were compiled.

4.  An official photo, taken within three months after acceptance of each 
promotion is required to be filed in the official military personnel file.  
See MILPERSMAN 1070-180 for the specifications required for the submission of 
photos.
