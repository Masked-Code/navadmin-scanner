RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces temporary basic allowance for housing (BAH) 
increases for qualified Service Members residing in certain military housing 
areas (MHA) from 1 October 2021 to 31 December 2021. 
 
2.  In line with reference (a) and the authority stipulated in reference (b), 
the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has approved temporary BAH rate 
increases due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic of 10, 15 
or 20 percent for qualified Service Members living in 56 MHAs.  Navy centric 
MHAs that are on the list include LEMOORE NAS (CA023), HAMPTON/NEWPORT NEWS 
(VA297), EL CENTRO (CA420), NEW LONDON (CT049) and BREMERTON (WA306).  A full 
list of the 56 MHAs impacted can be found via MyNavyHR  
at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/References/Pay-Benefits/N130C/.  It 
is important to note that if your MHA is not listed there, you are 
not eligible for a BAH increase. 
 
3.  The increased BAH rates are only payable from 1 October 2021 to 
31 December 2021 for Service Members living in one of the 56 impacted MHAs 
who request the temporary increase via their command and can certify, using 
procedures listed below, that their housing expenses are higher than their 
current 2021 BAH entitlement and that those higher expenses occurred after 13 
March 2020 such that they can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
4.  Once a Service Member has been approved for a temporary BAH rate 
increase, the new higher rate will remain effective through the duration of 
the authorized period unless the Service Member detaches or changes residence 
from the affected MHA.  Because temporary increases in BAH rates are not 
subject to rate protection, it is possible that Service Members will see 
higher or lower BAH rates than the temporary BAH rate they were receiving 
once the 2022 BAH rates become effective on 1 January 2022. 
 
5.  Scenarios 
    a.  Common situations that may warrant approval of a temporary BAH rate 
increase 
        (1) Service Members who have relocated into one of the 56 impacted 
MHAs on or after 13 March 2020 and incurred housing expenses that exceed 
their regular BAH rate at the new permanent duty station (PDS). 
        (2) Service Members who have renewed a lease within one of the 56 
impacted MHAs on or after 13 March 2020 and incurred higher housing expenses 
that exceed their current BAH rate at the PDS. 
        (3) Service Members who have relocated within one of the 56 impacted 
MHAs on or after 13 March 2020 and incurred housing expenses that exceed 
their 2021 BAH rate. 
    b.  Common situations that will warrant disapproval for temporary BAH 
rate increase 
        (1) Service Members that have not incurred increased housing expenses 
on or after 13 March 2020. 
        (2) Service Members that have incurred increased housing expenses on 
or after 13 March 2020 but cannot demonstrate authorized housing expenses 
exceed current BAH rate at the PDS. 
        (3) Service Members residing in privatized military housing. 
        (4) Homeowners who have incurred higher housing expenses on or after 
13 March 2020 as a result of refinanced mortgages or home equity loans. 
        (5) Service Members that have incurred increased expenses on or after 
13 March 2020 for a home that is not their primary residence. 
        (6) Service Members that have incurred increased expenses on or after 
13 March 2020, but do not reside within one of the 56 impacted MHAs. 
    c.  Additional guidance can be found below and via MyNavyHR at 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/References/Pay-Benefits/N130C/ website. 
        (1) Service Members using increased utility expenses as basis for 
their temporary BAH rate increase must demonstrate increased rates/costs on 
or after 13 March 2020 such that they can be attributed to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
        (2) Dual military couples may be eligible for temporary BAH rate 
increase.  Dual military couples residing in separate households at different 
physical locations should apply separately for a temporary BAH rate increase 
where applicable.  Dual military couples residing in a common household may 
be eligible for temporary BAH rate increase only if their housing expenses 
exceed their combined BAH.  A page 13 will be required with packages for all 
dual military couples denoting whether the couples are residing together or 
maintaining separate households. 
        (3) Qualifying costs may be established using documentation of 
housing costs between 13 March 2020 and 31 December 2021.  For example, a 
Service Member who entered a lease for an apartment with utilities included 
in June 2021, where the monthly rent exceeds the current BAH rate, may use 
that documentation to establish eligibility for the temporary increase that 
becomes effective 1 October 2021. 
        (4) Eligibility for payment is retroactive to the first month where 
qualifying costs are established, but no earlier than 1 October 2021. 
        (5) Once a Service Member establishes eligibility for the higher rate 
of BAH, eligibility continues through 31 December 2021, or upon rescission of 
reference (c), whichever occurs first.  If a status change occurs (i.e. 
promotion, demotion or dependent change) that affects the Service Members BAH 
rate, the Service Member is required to re-apply for the temporary BAH rate 
increase to determine whether they still meet the eligibility requirements in 
paragraph 1 based on their post-status change BAH rate.  There is no 
requirement to submit documentation of higher costs for each month in which 
the higher rate of BAH is received.  The Service Member must continue to 
reside at the location approved for temporary BAH rate increase in order to 
continue receiving the entitlement.  Any change in residence will require a 
new temporary BAH rate increase request. 
        (6) BAH at dependent location or previous duty station. Eligibility 
is based on the location for which the Service Member receives a housing 
allowance. 
 
6.  Process for submitting requests 
    a.  Sailors with a lease or mortgage (occupied and rented or owned by the 
Service Member and/or his/her military dependents) dated on or after 13 March 
2020 must submit a request to their O-5 or above commanding officer (CO) or 
officer-in-charge (OIC) in order to receive the temporary BAH rate.  In 
instances where the CO or OIC is O-4 or below, requests will be forwarded to 
O-5 or above immediate superior in charge for approval.  A template and 
guidance on what expenses count toward obtaining the temporary BAH rates for 
this request can be found via MyNavyHR at 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/References/Pay-Benefits/N130C/.  To document 
housing expenses noted in the template and certify higher housing costs, the 
request will include at a minimum, a copy of the lease (housing expenses only 
include the lease amount) or mortgage (housing expenses only include monthly 
principle and interest, monthly residential property taxes, monthly 
homeowners insurance and monthly mortgage insurance), utilities (utility 
expenses only include electricity, heat and water/sewer company statements) 
and leave and earning statement. 
    b.  Commands will submit Service Member requests endorsed by the O-5 or 
above CO or OIC to servicing personnel support detachment/transaction support 
center for processing.  To document housing expenses noted in the template 
and certify higher housing costs, commands will retain all supporting 
documents submitted by the Service Member in enterprise customer relationship 
management. 
    c.  Sailors with a lease or mortgage signed prior to 13 March 2020 
requesting a temporary BAH increase based on utilities increases under 
paragraph 5.c.(1) will require a determination from the Military Pay and 
Compensation Policy Branch (OPNAV N130). Commands should submit their 
endorsements and all required documents stated above to 
NXAG_N130C(at)navy.mil for a determination. 
    d.  All appeals will be adjudicated by OPNAV N130. 
 
7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
