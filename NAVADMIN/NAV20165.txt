RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces convening of the August 2020 Active-Duty 
Officer Lateral Transfer and Redesignation Board.  The lateral transfer and 
redesignation process is a key tool by which the Navy manages officer 
talent.  It provides flexibility in officer community manning and improves 
the Navy return on investment in officer training and education by leveraging 
the specialized skillsets of officers throughout their careers.  As part of 
the process, applications from qualified unrestricted line, restricted line, 
staff corps and non-off-ramp limited duty officers (LDO) are now being 
accepted for the August 2020 Active-Duty Officer Lateral Transfer and 
Redesignation Board, which convenes on 25 August 2020. Officers in LDO  
off-ramp communities requesting to redesignate with their parent community,  
full-time support and selected reserve officers are not eligible to apply for 
this board.  All officers considering applying for lateral transfer or 
redesignation through this board are strongly encouraged to familiarize 
themselves with references (a) through (l).  Board results will be posted on 
the NPC BUPERS-3 Active-Duty Lateral Transfer and Redesignation Board 
website via MyNavy Portal at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning. 
 
2.  Applicants must meet eligibility requirements detailed in references (a) 
through (c) and are required to review and comply with any additional 
community requirements found in the August 2020 Letter of Instruction (LOI), 
which can be viewed via MyNavy Portal at  
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning/overview. 
    a.  Officers who do not meet eligibility requirements per references (a) 
through (c) such as time-in-grade, years-of-commissioned service or time-in-
service must submit a waiver request in addition to, or in conjunction with, 
their lateral transfer and redesignation application as specified by specific 
communities. 
    b.  All application packages must include a letter from the current 
commanding officer, acknowledging their review of the application.  It should 
include their positive or negative endorsement of the officer application and 
specifically address any waiver requests by the officer.  These letters must 
be dated within 60 days of the application deadline. 
    c.  Active component LDOs in the supply corps (651X), information warfare 
community (68XX) and submarine communication (629X) are designated for off-
ramp as listed in references (k) and (l).  Those who desire to redesignate 
within their parent communities should submit their requests in accordance 
with reference (k) and (l) vice this board. 
 
3.  Submit applications and waiver requests (as required), using the 
format in reference (b) via e-mail to BUPERS3_LATXFR.fct(at)navy.mil.  E-mail 
subject line should reflect August 2020 Lateral Transfer Board and 
Redesignation Board.  If no means of electronic correspondence are available, 
hard copy application packages can be sent via U.S. Postal and Express Mail 
Services (to include FEDEX, UPS and DHL) to:

6.  The LOI, which can be viewed via MyNavy Portal at

with an indication of existing lateral transfer and resignation 
opportunities, as well as year group (YG) limitations. Designators indicated 
are authorizing a limited number of active duty officers to transfer from 
their current community.  Each YG is subject to change prior to the board 
convening.

choice(s) by priority in their application. Additionally, officers are
