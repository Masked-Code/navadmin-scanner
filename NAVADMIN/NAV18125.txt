RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides updated guidance to Public Key Infrastructure 
(PKI) Cryptographic Log-on (CLO) enforcement deadlines on Navy Marine Corps 
Internet (NMCI) and outside continental United States Navy Enterprise Network 
(ONE-Net) promulgated in references (a) through (c).

2.  Immediate action.  Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) tokens are now 
available for functional (or group) accounts (i.e., Tactical Actions Officer, 
Battle Watch Captain, Assistant Battle Watch Captain, Staff Duty Officer, 
watch accounts) and the use of a PKI token is mandatory.  All NMCI and ONE-
Net Non-classified Internet Protocol Router (NIPR) and SIPR functional 
accounts using username and password must transition to PKI CLO or other 
Department of Defense Chief Information officer (DoD CIO) approved forms of 
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) by 29 June 2018.  PKI CLO is a mandatory 
DoD requirement.

3.  Functional Account owners need to submit the required paperwork to their 
Information Systems Security Manager to transition their functional accounts 
from username and password to PKI CLO.  Commands must request functional (or 
group) account tokens through the Regional registration authority.  Reference 
(e) provides guidance related to PKI support.  To assist with token 
acquisition, a standard operating procedure is posted at:
https://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs/OPNAV/N2N6/DDCION/N2N6BC4/PKI.

4.  Non-Windows system accounts that are unable to utilize PKI must use 
another DoD CIO approved form of MFA.  Per references (f) through (h), the 
current approved MFAs that may be used are Centrify Server Suite and Centrify 
Privileged Service; RivestShamirAdleman (RSA) SecureID tokens; YubiKey 
Universal Two Factor tokens; and Gemalto SafeNet eToken PASS model 3000.  DoD 
CIO is the approval authority for any other alternative means of 
authentication.  Requests for approval of any other MFA products must be sent 
to the DoD CIO via the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information 
Warfare (OPNAV N2N6).  Contact the message point of contact for format and 
guidance.

5.  Any NMCI and ONE-Net functional accounts that are not using PKI logon by 
29 June 2018 will be disabled.

6.  Exception request guidance.
    a.  Request for exceptions to this NAVADMIN must be staffed via the chain 
of command through each respective Echelon II N6/Chief Information Officers 
Office for the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare 
(OPNAV N2N6) approval.
    b.  Exception requests must be endorsed by the first Flag Officer or 
Senior Executive Service in the chain of command and will only be accepted 
from Echelon II commands for approval or disapproval by OPNAV N2N6.
    c.  The account exception request form is posted at:
https://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs/OPNAV/N2N6/DDCION/N2N6BC4/PKI/.

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.

8.  Released by VADM Jan E. Tighe, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
