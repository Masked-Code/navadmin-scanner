RMKS/1. The Surface Navy Association (SNA) will hold its 30th Annual National 
Symposium in Arlington, VA, at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City from 9 - 11 
January 2018. The theme this year is Surface Forces and Cross-Domain 
Integration.

2. SNA membership is over 6,700 strong, of which 80 percent are active duty 
or former military members. The SNA Annual National Symposium provides an 
opportunity for discussions on a broad range of professional and career 
issues. This is a forum where personnel can discuss innovative solutions for 
current and future Surface Warfare challenges.

3. Per reference A, attendance at non-DoD hosted conferences which have 
historically exceeded $100,000 but are under $500,000 require approval by a 
Tier 2 conference approver. SNA 2018 meets this threshold. Therefore, any 
attendee requesting the use of government funds must submit their request to 
the first Tier 2 approver in their chain of command. Unless otherwise 
directed by the Tier 2 approving official, final conference requests are to 
be submitted to the approval authority no later than 30 days prior to the 
conference start date.  If no cost is incurred by the government 
(i.e.: people local to area), no approval is required.

4.  Reference B establishes requirements and procedures for submittal of 
conference attendance requests for all activities and organizations under the 
command of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). OPNAV Form 5050/11 must be 
used in processing Tier 2 approval of conference requests and can be 
downloaded here: 
https://navalforms.documentservices.dla.mil/formsDir/_OPNAV_5050_11_1489.pdf

5. Attendees and travel authorizing officials must be mindful of the need to 
be good stewards of taxpayer dollars in attending the symposium and are 
directed to follow the guidance in references A-D when authorizing travel. 
TAD orders may cover expenses incident to attendance and participation in the 
conference including transportation, per diem, and lodging fees.

6. Questions regarding the symposium should be directed to the SNA 
administrative office at (703) 960-6800, navysna@aol.com or visit 
www.navysna.org.

7. Released by Vice Admiral W. R. Merz, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, 
Warfare Systems (N9).//
