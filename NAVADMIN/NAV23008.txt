RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the expansion of the Military 
Parental Leave Program in line with references (a) through (c). 
This NAVADMIN cancels reference (d) and supersedes reference (e). 
Reference (f) is unaffected by this guidance. 
 
2.  Effective 27 December 2022, reference (b) implements 12 weeks of 
non-chargeable leave for all Active Component (AC) members, Reserve 
Component (RC) members who perform full-time active duties for 
longer than 12 consecutive months, and RC members performing duty 
under a call or order to active service for more than 12 consecutive 
months.  In the event of a live birth, 12 weeks of non-chargeable 
leave is authorized for the birth parent and non-birth parent.  For 
the birth parent, the 12 weeks is in addition to convalescent leave 
authorized by a medical provider and approved by a member's 
commanding officer (CO).  The 12 weeks of non-chargeable leave is 
also authorized for qualifying adoptions and long-term foster 
situations and may be taken in one increment or multiple increments. 
If taken in multiple increments, each increment must be for at least 
7 days.  Unless extended in line with reference (b), parental leave 
expires 1 year after the qualifying event. 
 
3.  The Navy parental leave program will be executed in line with 
reference (b).  Read reference (b) in its entirety.  Guidance 
contained in this NAVADMIN is to be used as a supplement to 
reference (b). 
 
4.  Proof of Parentage for the Non-birth Parent:  Paragraph 2.b.(2) 
of reference (b) requires proof of parentage for non-birth parents 
to qualify for parental leave.  Examples of proof of parentage 
include: 
a.  being listed, with consent, as a parent on the birth 
certificate of the child or other government issued document, 
b.  acknowledgement in writing of an obligation to support the 
child, either by voluntary agreement or court order, or 
c.  registration, or pending registration, in the Defense 
Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). 
 
5.  Qualifying Adoption.  In addition to the definition of an 
adoption in reference (b), a qualifying adoption is one that 
qualifies for reimbursement of adoption expenses in line with 
reference (g). 
 
6.  Appeal Process if Incremental Parental Leave is disapproved. 
Paragraph 3.a.(1) of reference (b) requires establishment of an 
elective appeal process if a CO disapproves a request to take 
parental leave in more than one increment.  Members may appeal 
disapproval to the Immediate Superior in Command of their respective 
unit. 
 
7.  Requesting Parental Leave:  The appropriate category of parental 
leave must be requested through e-Leave in Navy Standard Integrated 
Personnel System (NSIPS).  NSIPS, to include NSIPS Web Afloat, will 
be updated to reflect the expanded Military Parental Leave.  The 
following procedures will be used for requesting parental leave in 
NSIPS until the update is completed: 
a.  Select Primary Caregiver Leave (PCL) and the appropriate 
absence reason in block 12a.  If the parental leave is for placement 
of a child in long-term foster care, the absence reason is to be 
left blank. 
b.  Requests for parental leave that exceed 42 days must be 
submitted as separate PCL periods. 
c.  Leave approvers are responsible for ensuring parental leave 
is approved within the limits outlined in this NAVADMIN to include 
maintaining record of a members parental leave balance for each 
qualifying event. 
 
8.  Navy-wide Advancement Exam (NWAE).  Parental leave is an 
authorized reason for ordering a substitute exam when the leave does 
not permit administration on the regularly scheduled NWAE date under 
and within guidelines, limitations, and timelines outlined in 
published exam cycle messages. 
 
9.  Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA): 
a.  The authorized deferment period from participating in the PFA 
as listed in reference (h), or any future PFA update, begins from 
the time a health care provider confirms the member is pregnant 
until the end of 12 months following the member giving birth to a 
child. 
b.  Utilization of parental leave by the non-birth parent is not 
justification for non-participation in PFAs. 
 
10.  No member will be disadvantaged in their career, including 
limitations in their assignments (except where members voluntarily 
agree to accept an assignment limitation), performance appraisals, 
or selection for professional military education or training, solely 
because they take any of the non-chargeable leave outlined herein. 
 
11.  Additional information, including reference (b), can be found 
at:  https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/References/Pay-Benefits/N130C/. 
Point of contact for this matter is the office of Pay and Allowances 
(OPNAV N130C) and can be reached via e-mail at 
nxag_n130c(at)navy.mil. 
 
12.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or 
canceled.  Updates to references (e) and (i) reflecting the changes 
in this NAVADMIN will be released at a later date.
