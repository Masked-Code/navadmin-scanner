RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and provides Fiscal Year 2019 
(FY) guidelines for the execution of reference (b).  As local policy may be 
more restrictive, all subordinate commands should refer to their Echelon II 
Command Information Officer (CIO) for additional guidance in regards to this 
NAVADMIN.

2.  The Information Technology Procurement Request (ITPR) process ensures 
efficient expenditure of IT funding, prevents duplicative investments, 
provides visibility on all Navy IT-related expenditures, and achieves 
strategic sourcing for IT capabilities and procurements.  All ITPRs will be 
submitted electronically via the Navy Information Technology Approval System 
(NAV-ITAS) in accordance with reference (b).

3.  The following FY19 guidelines will be used for the submission of ITPRs in 
FY19:
    a.  Subject matter expert (SME) Speed Pass:  The SME Speed Pass was 
devised to make it easier for commands to expedite ITPR reviews.  The SME 
Speed Pass may only be used for the following IT procurements to allow for 
expedited review.
        (1) All programs of record (POR).  POR information must be supplied 
within the ITPR if this option is selected;
        (2) Procurements that are out of scope of the ITPR policy per 
reference (b); and
        (3) Procurements that are exempt from the ITPR requirements in FY19, 
as noted in paragraph 5 of this document.
    b.  Multi-Function Device (MFD) products and/or services:  The following 
guidelines are applicable for the procurement of any MFD product and/or 
service in FY19:
        (1) Per reference (c), all procurement actions for MFD products or 
services made outside of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) or the Next 
Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) marketplace must submit a waiver for 
approval by the appropriate Echelon I SME, and
        (2) All ITPRs for the procurement of MFD products and/or services 
from DLA must be submitted by 21 June 2019 in order to meet the DLA 
procurement cut-off date of 1 July 2019.  Requests submitted after 21 June 
2019 will not be considered without documented extenuating circumstances.
    c.  Windows 10 Secure Host Baseline (WIN 10 SHB) Migration:  Per 
reference (d), all Department of Defense (DoD) component organizations must 
migrate from Microsoft legacy operating systems to the Defense Information 
Service Agency approved WIN 10 SHB version unless otherwise waived in 
accordance with Deputy Department of the Navy Chief Information Officer 
(Navy) (DDCIO(N)) issued guidance.  A justification statement must be 
included in the ITPR executive summary for the procurement or sustainment of 
a legacy operating system (including any associated hardware, software, 
and/or support services).
    d.  ITPRs requesting approval for execution of FY20 funding will be 
accepted starting in the fourth quarter of FY19.
        (1) ITPRs requesting approval for execution of FY20 funding submitted 
prior to the fourth quarter of FY19 will be handled on a case-by-case basis.  
All such ITPRs must include an additional statement in the ITPR executive 
summary stating the necessity to obtain approval for FY20 funding prior to 
the fourth quarter of FY19; and
        (2) The submitting command must include the following statement in 
the ITPR executive summary:  The Budget Submission Office asserts that it 
will not obligate FY20 funds prior to 1 October 2019 and affirms such funding 
is subject to all the provisions of either a FY20 DoD appropriation act or a 
FY20 Continuing Resolutions Act, whichever is applicable.  All funds in 
support of a Defense Business System (DBS) are subject to FY20 DBS 
certification by the appropriate approval authority.  Approving this request 
will not cause an Anti-Deficiencies Act violation and/or an unauthorized 
commitment on behalf of the government.

4.  The following criteria and thresholds are set for ITPRs submitted in 
FY19:
    a.  All ITPRs submitted for the purchase of the following types of Navy 
IT, regardless of cost, will be routed to the applicable Navy Echelon I SME 
for review.
        (1) Cloud computing services, commercial or government, as identified 
in reference (e);
        (2) Navy IT Help Desks or upgrades; and
        (3) Procurement/maintenance support of portals, websites, and web 
presences.
    b.  As applicable by policy, a waiver must be submitted and approved by 
the appropriate Echelon I SME for the purchase of the following types of Navy 
IT, regardless of cost:
        (1) Data Center/Data Server Waiver:  ITPRs containing data center 
/data server items must route through the Data Canter/Data Server Approval 
process to be reviewed and approved by DDCIO(N) and DON Office of the Chief 
Information Officer;
        (2) MFD Waiver:  Waiver is required for the procurement of an MFD 
products and/or services from a vendor/distributor other than DLA or the NGEN 
Marketplace;
        (3) Enterprise License Agreement (ELA)/Enterprise Software Initiative 
(ESI) Waiver:  Waiver is required if a DON, DoD, or Joint ELA or ESI is 
available but is not used for procurement of software, hardware, or related 
services; and
        (4) All other Navy IT not documented herein but mandated by the 
DDCIO(N) to require procurement approval by the DDCIO(N).
    c.  For all other Navy IT, the following thresholds apply for approval:
        (1) All requests of $500,000 or greater will route to the DDCIO(N)

                7.  FY19 year of execution DBS requirements; and
                8.  Contract support services that will exceed the $25,000 
threshold over the course of the contract (including option years).
        (4) Echelon II CIOs are required to track IT transactions of $25,000 
or less but are not required to submit an ITPR in NAV-ITAS unless covered by 
paragraph 3.c.(3).a. or any requirement specified in reference (b).
            (a) Echelon II CIOs are authorized to use the abbreviated ITPR 
Form in NAV-ITAS for these procurements;
            (b) Per reference (f), submission of an ITPR in NAV-ITAS is 
optional for purchases of $25,000 or less (including government purchase card 
purchases); and
            (c) Echelon II CIOs that do not utilize the Abbreviated ITPR Form 
must submit a quarterly report to the DDCIO(N) outlining all IT spend of 
$25,000 or less in accordance with ITPR process and procedural guidance 
issues by the DDCIO(N).

5.  Unless otherwise directed by the Echelon II command, the following are 
exempt from the ITPR requirements in FY19 and, therefore, do not require 
submission or approval of an ITPR:
    a.  Software and/or systems embedded in non-command and 
control/communications weapon systems.  This is not a blanket exemption for 
all Warfighting Mission Area systems, lab infrastructure, or other types of 
National Security Systems.  This exemption does include IT embedded in 
replicas of weapons systems for Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation 
lab use.
        (1) Embedded software is computer software, written to control 
machines or devices that are not typically thought of as computers; and
        (2) An embedded system is a programmed controlling and operating 
system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical 
system, often with real-time computing constraints.  It is embedded as part 
of a complete device, often including hardware and mechanical parts.

not data center or data server related.
        (1) Per reference (g), a consumable item is an item of supply or an 
individual item (except explosive ordnance and major end items of equipment) 
that is normally expended or used up beyond recovery in the use for which it 
is designed or intended; and
        (2) A peripheral device is an internal or external device that 
connects to and works with a computer to either put information into the 
computer or to get information out of the computer.  Peripheral devices 
connect with a computer through an input/output (I/O) interface (e.g., 
communications, Universal Serial Bus, or serial port).  A peripheral device 
may also be referred to as an external peripheral, integrated peripheral, 
auxiliary component, computer peripheral, or I/O device.
    c.  NGEN contract line item numbers (priced and unpriced) that are:
        (1) Not associated with NGEN program management, network 
infrastructure, or MFDs; and
        (2) Not subject to Echelon II SME review and/or waiver approval as 
specified in paragraph 3.a and 3.b of this document.
    d.  Personnel IT training and subscriptions not reported in the Navys IT 
budget.
