2.  THE NAVY HAS MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE IMPACT OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT ACROSS OUR FORCE.  THIS IS AN ALL HANDS EFFORT.  THE NEXT STEP 
IN THE NAVY'S CONTINUUM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION TRAINING IS THE ROLL OUT 
OF SAPR-F TRAINING FOR ALL ACTIVE AND RESERVE MID-GRADE AND JUNIOR ENLISTED

ACTIVELY ENGAGE SAILORS AND DELIVER THE INTERACTIVE VIDEO AND FACILITATED

EXPERIENCED MID-LEVEL LEADERSHIP, CLOSER TO THE AGE OF MOST E6 AND BELOW,

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CPPD) PRIOR TO CONDUCTING SAPR-F TRAINING AS 
PROMULGATED IN REFERENCE B (VCNO PERSONAL FOR).

4.  IN THE INTEREST OF PROVIDING MAXIMUM SUPPORT TO BOTH THE FACILITATORS AND 
THE PARTICIPANTS, ALL TRAINING MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH EITHER A SEXUAL ASSAULT 
RESPONSE COORDINATOR (SARC), UNIT VICTIM ADVOCATE, CHAPLAIN, OR HEALTH CARE 
PERSONNEL IN ATTENDANCE; THEIR CHARGE IS TO NON-OBTRUSIVELY IDENTIFY 
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE STRUGGLING WITH THE MATERIAL, SHOW SIGNS OF DISTRESS, 
OR WHO DEPART THE TRAINING, AND TO PROVIDE SUPPORT, REFERRAL, OR COUNSELING AS 
NECESSARY.

5.  DOCUMENTATION.  COMPLETION OF ALL TRAINING WILL BE REPORTED USING THE 
FLEET TRAINING MANAGEMENT PLANNING SYSTEM (FLTMPS).
ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON FLTMPS REPORTING IS PROVIDED IN REF C.

6.  TRAINING COMPLETION DATE.  TO ALLOW AMPLE TIME FOR SAPR-F TRAINING TO BE 
COMPLETED AND DOCUMENTED IN FLTMPS, THE DEADLINE FOR ACTIVE AND RESERVE E6 AND 
BELOW COMPLETION OF SAPR-F HAS BEEN EXTENDED UNTIL 31 MARCH 2013.

7.  RESOURCES.  ALL SAPR-F RESOURCES, INCLUDING THE VIDEO, COURSE FACILITATION 
GUIDE, AND REFERENCE MATERIAL, WILL BE SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO THE COMMANDING 
OFFICER OR OFFICER IN CHARGE.  IN THE EVENT A COMMAND HAS NOT RECEIVED THE DVD

DOWNLOAD THE REQUIRED VIDEO CLIPS.

    B.  SAPR-F TRAINING IS REQUIRED FOR UNIFORMED PERSONNEL ONLY.
    C.  SAPR-F TRAINING MATERIAL WILL NOT BE MODIFIED BY SUBORDINATE COMMANDS.

    F.  GUIDANCE FOR SAILORS ASSIGNED TO OPERATIONAL UNITS THAT ARE UNABLE TO

PREVENT THIS CRIME.
