RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the establishment of the Maritime Space 
Officer (MSO) designator (187X) within the Information Warfare Community 
(IWC). 
 
2.  MSO establishment is a major milestone in building out the Navy space 
community.  MSOs will be the maritime space integration and planning 
professionals of the Navy, providing a unique combination of prior warfare 
qualification, operational experience and fundamental knowledge and 
background in space-related capabilities. Developing the Navy MSO community 
is critical to achieving national security objectives through the integration 
of space capabilities into maritime operations and plans. 
 
3.  MSOs will be members of the IWC and assigned globally to fill key space 
oriented positions throughout the Fleet, to include Navy Maritime Operation 
Centers, Navy Warfighting Development Centers, U.S. Space Command, the 
National Intelligence Community and the Information Warfare Type Command. 
 
4.  Applications for redesignation into the MSO community are now 
welcome.  Warfare qualified unrestricted line and restricted line officers 
with six or more years of commissioned service are encouraged to apply.  All 
applications must have the concurrence of the current (losing) community 
manager and the MSO (gaining) community managers to ensure their eligibility 
for lateral transfer. Application package requirements are outlined in 
paragraph 4 of reference (a), which begin with the application being 
submitted to the current (losing) community manager via the commanding 
officer of the applicant.  Completed applications should then be submitted 
via e-mail to Ms. Jana Rittman, Assistant IW Community Manager at BUPER- 
31_IWC_FCT(at)NAVY.MIL no later than 45 days following the date of 
this NAVADMIN.  Additionally, applicants can receive the most up-to- 
date guidance on the application process on the MSO webpage located 
under the information warfare officer community management tab at 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Officer/Active-OCM/Restricted-Line/Information-Warfare/. 
 
5.  Applicants will be notified of their selection status once the initial 
list of MSO accessions has been approved.
