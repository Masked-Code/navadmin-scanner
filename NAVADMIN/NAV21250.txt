RMKS/1.  In support of reference (a), this NAVADMIN issues guidance for
officers interested in serving as military mentors in Department of Defense
(DoD) 2022 Senate Youth Program.

2.  As specified in reference (a), the DoD is soliciting nominations for 12
military officers (O-2 through O-5) to serve as ambassadors of the Armed
Forces in support of the 60th Annual United States Senate Youth Program
(USSYP) to be hosted online during the March 5-12, 2022 timeframe.  This
educational experience for outstanding high school juniors and seniors
interested in pursuing careers in public service was established in 1962 and
is one of the longest standing commitments of the Office of the Secretary of
Defense to a national youth program.  USSYP military mentors represent their
individual Service components and serve as role models for the 104 USSYP
student delegates, two from each state, the District of Columbia, and the
Department of Defense Education Activity.  They exemplify the highest
standards of decorum and protocol, facilitate inclusive and insightful
debate and discussion among the students, and assist USSYP staff with
implementation of the program agenda.  Each military mentor is assigned a
group of student delegates for the duration of the program, presenting a
unique opportunity for these bright and influential young Americans to gain
a better understanding of DoD's mission, people, and interrelationship with
the other branches of the federal government -.  Nominees must be available
for all training and program participation, March 1-12, 2022.  Application
requirements are specified at https ://pa.sp.pentagon.mil/Senate
YouthProgram/SitePages/Home.aspx.  The deadline to apply is November 15,
2021. The Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public
Affairs will announce military mentor selections by January 7, 2022.

3.  For additional questions pertaining to this NAVADMIN, please contact Mr.
