AMPN/REF A TASKS ALL NAVY COMMANDS WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUBMITTING THE 
ANNUAL COMMAND OPERATIONS REPORT. REF B AND C ARE MESSAGES SENT TO THE 
RESPECTIVE FLEET UNITS REMINDING THE UNITS OF CORS SUBMISSION.//

RMKS/1.  Per reference (a), submission of Command Operations Reports (COR) is 
every Commander's responsibility.  References (b) and (c) were proactive 
messages to alert fleet commands to the requirements to submit 2014 CORs by 1 
March 2015.  Given the current Office of the Chief of Naval Operations 
(OPNAV) and Department of Defense Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and 
Execution processes, missing reports have an increasingly negative impact on 
the Navy.  To date, 827 CORs out of 1,719 due have been submitted.  If your 
command has not submitted its report, please do so, subject to the deferred 
submission option for currently deployed units.

2.  CORs are vital reports which are identified for permanent retention and 
reflect the Navy's operational and administrative activities for each 
calendar year.  Important functions and uses of these reports include:
    a.	Provide critical informational support for OPNAV action officers 
to develop future Navy operational needs and policies, manage ongoing program 
requirements, and determine budget priorities.
    b.	Provide documentation for the Chief of Naval Operations when 
requesting funding from Congress for Navy programs.
    c.	Provide Commanders with access to their own unit's operational 
history including lessons learned, future planning data, operational metrics, 
and other valuable information.
    d.	Provide building blocks for composite command histories spanning 
many years.
    e.	Document the Navy's role in operations such as Operation INHERENT 
RESOLVE, Operation ODYSSEY DAWN, and Operation ENDURING FREEDOM.
    f.	Develop a sense of history, esprit de corps, tradition, and 
professionalism within the Navy.
    g.	Provide vital documentation to support Navy legal teams for 
claims/litigation involving Navy.
    h.	Support veteran's claims with Department of Veterans Affairs.

3.  The COR should be submitted electronically to Naval History and Heritage 
Command (NHHC).  Reference (a) and the electronic form may be downloaded from 
the NHHC's website (http://www.history.navy.mil/about-us/instructions-and-
forms/submit-a-command-operations-report.html).  Questions concerning the 
report should be directed to email:  archivemail(AT)navy.mil, comm:  (202) 
433-3224, or DSN:  94-433-3224.  CORs classified no higher than the Secret 
level can be submitted using SIPRNET at: archives(AT)navy.smil.mil.  NHHC 
currently has no means of receiving CORs classified above the Secret level by 
email.  For commands that need to submit a COR above the Secret level, refer 
to directions cited in reference (a).
