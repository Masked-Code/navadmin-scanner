RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN SUMMARIZES NAVY'S FY-10 RETENTION PERFORMANCE AND 
OUTLINES FY-11 RETENTION ENVIRONMENT AND REENLISTMENT BENCHMARKS.

2.  FY-10 PERFORMANCE.  NAVY EXCEEDED RETENTION GOALS ESTABLISHED FOR FY-10, 
ATTAINING 133 PERCENT OF OUR NUMERIC REENLISTMENT MISSION (35,525 
REENLISTMENTS COMPARED TO A GOAL OF 26,700) FOR SAILORS IN THE FIRST 14 YEARS 
OF SERVICE.  FY-10 ATTRITION RATES DECREASED IN ZONES A THROUGH C COMPARED TO 
FY-09.  A SUMMARY OF FY-10 RETENTION INCLUDES:
    A.  ALL-NAVY FY-10 REENLISTMENT RATE
                                       GOAL          ACTUAL
ZONE A (0 TO 6 YEARS OF SERVICE)       55 PERCENT    63.9 PERCENT
ZONE B (6 TO 10 YEARS OF SERVICE)      60 PERCENT    69.4 PERCENT
ZONE C (10 TO 14 YEARS OF SERVICE)     71 PERCENT    79.3 PERCENT
    B.  ALL-NAVY ATTRITION RATES
             FY-08 ACTUAL     FY-09 ACTUAL    FY-10
             ACTUAL
ZONE A       8.40 PERCENT     7.28 PERCENT    6.80 PERCENT
ZONE B       2.44 PERCENT     2.40 PERCENT    1.96 PERCENT
ZONE C       1.52 PERCENT     1.42 PERCENT    1.34 PERCENT

3.  FY-11 RETENTION ENVIRONMENT AND REENLISTMENT BENCHMARKS.  NAVY WILL 
CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN A HIGH PERFORMANCE FORCE THROUGH THE UTILIZATION OF 
PERFORM TO SERVE.  WE ARE EXPERIENCING HISTORICALLY HIGH DESIRE TO STAY NAVY, 
SO COMPETITION FOR RECEIVING PTS APPROVAL HAS INCREASED.  EARLY SEPARATION AND 
SENIOR ENLISTED RETIREMENT TIME-IN-GRADE WAIVER POLICIES CONTINUE WITH 
LIMITATIONS AS SPECIFIED IN REFS E AND F, RESPECTIVELY.  IN ORDER TO ENSURE 
FLEET READINESS, I HAVE SET THE FOLLOWING FY-11 REENLISTMENT BENCHMARKS FOR 
ALL-NAVY REENLISTMENTS:
ZONE A (0 TO 6 YEARS OF SERVICE)       59 PERCENT
ZONE B (6 TO 10 YEARS OF SERVICE)      66 PERCENT
ZONE C (10 TO 14 YEARS OF SERVICE)     72 PERCENT
THESE BENCHMARKS REPRESENT THE NUMBERS TO WHICH WE WILL MANAGE THE FORCE TO 
REMAIN WITHIN CONGRESSIONALLY MANDATED END STRENGTH LIMITS.  THEY ARE NOT, AS 
IN PREVIOUS YEARS, "GOALS" FOR INDIVIDUAL COMMANDS TO EXCEED IN ORDER TO 
QUALIFY FOR RETENTION EXCELLENCE AWARDS.  PER REF C, ECHELON II COMMANDS SHALL 
ALIGN THEIR RECOGNITION PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE FY-11 ALL-
NAVY BENCHMARKS, HOWEVER THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO USE THE AGGREGATE FY-11 ALL-
NAVY REENLISTMENT BENCHMARKS TO DETERMINE AWARD ELIGIBILITY.

4.  BRILLIANT ON THE BASICS.  ACHIEVING FIT THROUGH RETENTION.  WE CONTINUE TO 
SHAPE THE FORCE TO ACHIEVE THE BEST "FIT" OF SAILORS RANK/RATE/NEC IN RELATION 
TO OUR BILLET STRUCTURE.  CAREFUL MANAGEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES IS 
NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED FIT.  THERE ARE RATINGS THAT REQUIRE ZONE A 
REENLISTMENT OF MORE THAN 80 PERCENT FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH; OTHERS MAY ONLY 
REQUIRE 40 PERCENT.
UNDERSTANDING OF INDIVIDUAL MANPOWER NEEDS IS ESSENTIAL TO INFLUENCING THE 
REENLISTMENT BEHAVIOR OF OUR MOST CRITICAL RATINGS.  TO ENSURE SAILORS HAVE 
THE VERY BEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUING THEIR NAVY CAREER, THE COMMAND'S 
FY-11 RETENTION EXCELLENCE RECOGNITION PROGRAM WILL HAVE A STRONG FOUNDATION 
BUILT UPON REF B, "BRILLIANT ON THE BASICS".  THE CURRENT COMPETITIVE 
ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES THAT EACH SAILOR RECEIVES ON-TIME GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING 
NECESSARY TO MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE CAREER DECISIONS.
ADDITIONALLY, TIMELY QUALIFICATION AND DESIGNATION OF OUR PROFESSIONAL 
APPRENTICESHIP CAREER TRACK (PACT) SAILORS IN FLEET RIDE IS ESSENTIAL TO 
ACHIEVING FIT.  ECHELON II COMMANDS WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING 
CATEGORIES/BENCHMARKS IN THEIR RETENTION EXCELLENCE AWARD PROGRAMS:
    A.  COMMANDS MUST ACHIEVE A MINIMUM SCORE OF 85 POINTS ON
    THEIR ANNUAL COMMAND CAREER INFORMATION PROGRAM REVIEW.
   B.  COMMANDS MUST ACHIEVE 100 PERCENT ON-TIME PTS APPLICATION
   SUBMISSIONS.
    C.  COMMANDS WITH PACT SAILORS MUST ACHIEVE 100 PERCENT
    QUALIFICATION OF PACT SAILORS VIA THE FLEET RATING IDENTIFICATION ENGINE 
(FLEET RIDE).
ECHELON II COMMANDS MAY ADD ADDITIONAL CATEGORIES AND BENCHMARKS IN THEIR 
RETENTION EXCELLENCE AWARD PROGRAMS.  REFERENCES D THROUGH L PROVIDE 
ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDANCE FOR PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF CAREER PROGRAMS.

5.  TO PROVIDE PROPER GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING, CURRENT COMMUNITY HEALTH 
INFORMATION FOR EACH RATING IS AVAILABLE ON THE NAVAL PERSONNEL COMMAND 
WEBSITE VIA THE COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT WEBPAGE LOCATED AT:
HTTP://WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/ENLISTED/COMMUNITYMANAGERS.  COMMANDS DESIRING A 
RETENTION HEALTH BRIEF SHOULD CONTACT THE SPECIFIC COMMUNITY MANAGER.  UIC 
SPECIFIC RETENTION HEALTH IS UPDATED MONTHLY AND AVAILABLE THROUGH YOUR 
COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR BY ACCESSING THE NAVY RETENTION MONITORING SYSTEM.  
RETENTION EXCELLENCE AWARD QUERIES SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO EACH COMMAND'S 
APPROPRIATE TYCOM.
