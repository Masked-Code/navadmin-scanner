SUBJ/NOTICE OF CONVENING FY25-1 TEST PILOT SCHOOL SELECTION BOARD// 
 
REF/A/DOC/BUPERS/06JAN21// 
AMPN/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1500.62E, TEST PILOT SCHOOLS.// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces convening of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot 
School (USNTPS) selection board on 15 November 2023.  This board will select 
highly qualified naval aviators and naval flight officers (NFO) for USNTPS 
and U.S. Air Force TPS.  USNTPS graduates have significant and long lasting 
influence on platforms and systems that directly impact the future 
warfighting capability of the Fleet. 
Request command and Fleet community assistance to identify candidates with 
strong operational performance and ideally, strong academic backgrounds in 
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields of study. 
 
2.  To be eligible for board consideration, a command endorsed application in 
line with reference (a), must be received by MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) no 
later than 11 October 2023.  Additional documentation (including Wing/CAG 
endorsements, letters of recommendation, fitness reports, etc.) will be 
accepted until 1 November 2023, but must be submitted by the applicant, as a 
letter to the board, in line with subparagraph 4a below.  The e-mail 
address(es), phone number(s), college transcripts, anthropometric data 
measurement record, a current Body Composition Assessment report from 
Physical Readiness Information Management System Two and post-TPS test 
squadron assignment preferences of the applicant must be included with the 
application.  Current contact information (ashore/afloat) of commanding 
officer must also be included to expedite notification, if selected. 
 
3.  The command endorsement shall explicitly state whether the applicant, if 
selected, will be allowed and available to report for pre-arrival training by 
the following dates: 
    a.  1 April 2024 for fixed wing pilots. 
    b.  8 April 2024 for rotary wing pilots. 
    c.  6 May 2024 for NFOs. 
Endorsements with availability dates after these above respective dates may 
be removed from consideration and not reviewed by the board.  Inability for 
the applicant to meet the above date may be mitigated by conducting initial 
training in a temporary additional duty (TEMADD) status at the expense of the 
endorsing command.  If this is required, it must be explicitly stated in the 
command endorsement that the endorsing command will provide TEMADD funds 
until the applicant can officially detach. 
 
4.  Application package submissions: 
    a.  The preferred method of application submission is electronic.  E-mail
