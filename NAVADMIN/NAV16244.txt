RMKS/1.  The annual Secretary of Defense Awards Program recognizes the 
Department of Defense's most outstanding field-level and depot-level military 
maintenance units from a very competitive field of candidates.  I would like 
to extend my congratulations and gratitude for all Navy units that submitted 
nomination packages in accordance with references (a) and (b).  Each nominee 
should be proud of their accomplishments.

2.  Reference (c) announced the winners of 2016 Secretary of Defense 
Maintenance Awards for field-level and depot-level maintenance.  The field-
level awards are given to two of the most outstanding field-level maintenance 
units in each of three categories (small, medium, large) across the 
Department of Defense.  For depot-level activities, one program across the 
entire Department of Defense is awarded the Robert T. Mason Award for Depot 
Maintenance Excellence. The Navy winners for the 2016 SECDEF Maintenance 
Awards are as follows:  Field-Level Large Category:  USS RONALD REAGAN (CVN 
76), Forward Deployed, Yokosuka, Japan Depot-Level Category:
USS ALEXANDRIA (SSN 757) Engineered Overhaul Project Team, Portsmouth Naval 
Shipyard, Portsmouth, NH

3.  These awards will be formally presented to the winning units on
6 December 2016 during the Secretary of Defense Maintenance Awards Ceremony 
which will take place during the 2016 Department of Defense Maintenance 
Symposium being held in Albuquerque, NM.  The highlight of the Awards 
Ceremony will be the announcement of the Phoenix Award. The Phoenix Award 
goes to the very best maintenance unit from the field-level awards winners.  
Winners of the Secretary of Defense Maintenance Awards will be presented 
plaques and certificates of achievement for retention by the winning units.  
The Phoenix Trophy and the Robert T. Mason Award for Depot Maintenance 
Excellence Trophy will be permanently displayed in the Pentagon in 
Washington, D.C., to allow for suitable viewing and will bear the name of the 
current year’s award winners. Replicas of the trophies will be presented to 
the winning units to retain for approximately one year.

4.  The 2016 Department of Defense Maintenance Symposium will be held from 5-
8 December 2016, at the Albuquerque Convention Center, located in 
Albuquerque, NM.  The Department of Defense Maintenance Symposium is DoD's 
premier maintenance community event, and is intended to be a forum to discuss 
key maintenance related topics and increase the overall awareness of DoD 
maintenance initiatives.  The symposium is open to DoD contractors, civilian, 
and military personnel from all Services.  Maximum participation from the 
maintenance community is highly encouraged.  Additional information on the 
symposium, including events, panel discussions, registration, and hotel 
accommodations can be found at:  http://www.sae.org/events/dod/

5.  Congratulations on a job well done to both USS RONALD REAGAN and the USS 
ALEXANDRIA EOH Project Team at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard! Your efforts 
exemplify excellence in the maintenance profession within the United States 
Navy, which has garnered recognition throughout the Department of Defense.  
You should be very proud of your accomplishments, as you now represent the 
best of military maintenance.  BRAVO ZULU!
