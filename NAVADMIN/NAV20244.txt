RMKS/1.  13 October 2020 will mark the Navy's 245th Birthday.  The central 
theme of this year's 245th birthday and heritage week remains "Victory at 
Sea," which encompasses the Navy's efforts in battle during World War II. The 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires a significant change to 
the traditional way of celebrating the Navy?s Birthday.  As a result, there 
will not be a traditional Navy Ball.  Alternative events are encouraged that 
are in accordance with COVID-19 protocols and references (a) and (b).

2.  CNO and MCPON intend to produce a prerecorded video presentation that 
highlights Navy heritage, which allows us to flex our multi-media skillsets 
while incorporating Navy guidance provided in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Given the time constraints, our media team has maximum flexibility 
to coordinate schedules and location for recording and producing these 
presentations. The traditional events will also move to pre-recorded or live 
streamed video celebrations to include, but not limited to:
    a.  The Navy Birthday Cake Cutting Ceremony
    b.  The Navy Birthday Worship Service
    c.  The Navy Birthday Band Concert

3.  Execute Navy Birthday events in a manner that brings honor and respect 
upon our service while respecting the complications of the COVID-19 pandemic.

4.  Fleet Commanders are requested to provide prerecorded video presentations 
that highlights Navy heritage in their prospective fleet concentration area 
to CHINFO by 02 October.

5.  Command relationships.
    a.  NHHC is the supported command.
    b.  CNIC, CHINFO, COMRESFOR, and NDW are supporting commands.
    c.  Additional coordination instructions and tasking to be provided by 
separate correspondence (SEPCOR) as plans develop.

6.  Point of Contact (POC).
    a.  NHHC POC is Alura Romero, comm:  202-685-6361, email:  
alura.romero(AT)navy.mil.
    b.  CHINFO POC LT Clinton Ramsden, comm: 703-697-1922, email:
