SUBJ/CAREER TRANSITION OFFICE NAME CHANGE//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces and discusses the name change for Navy 
Personnel Command (NAVPERSCOM) Career Transition Office (CTO)
(PERS-97) from CTO to Reserve Processing and Affiliation Center (RPAC).

2.  Background.  Commander, Navy Personnel Command, Commander, Navy Reserve 
Force and Commander, Navy Recruiting Command have been engaging in functional 
re-alignment, transforming the Active Component to Reserve Component (AC2RC) 
process towards a "One Sales Agency" approach designed to maximize accession 
on-ramps, off-ramps, and retention across the Navy Reserve.  As a part of 
this transformation, PERS-97 is transitioning to a processing center of 
excellence, centralizing transactions required to successfully affiliate 
transitioning members with the Navy Reserve.  The shift from CTO to RPAC is 
representative of these changes and the inherent goal of providing enhanced 
customer service.

3.  Process.  The AC2RC affiliation process has been revised to capitalize on 
the strengths of all stakeholders involved.
Commanding Officers (COs), command triads, and Command Career Counselors 
(CCCs) must review subsequent updates to respective policies and positional 
course syllabi to better advise their transitioning Sailors.
    a.  Enlisted Sailors will continue to initiate the affiliation process 
through their CCCs via a Career Waypoints-Reenlistment application or an 
Enlisted Personnel Action Request (NAVPERS 1306/7), for a Selected Reserve 
(SELRES) quota.  Following quota adjudication by Enlisted Reserve Community 
Management (BUPERS-352), all Sailors with an approved quota will be contacted 
by RPAC regarding their SELRES affiliation.
    b.  Officers resigning from Active Duty will be counseled by the CO or 
Executive Officer, on the benefits of continued service in the Navy Reserve.  
Upon approval of their resignation by NAVPERSCOM Unqualified Officer 
Resignations (PERS-45), all officers will be initially contacted by the Navy 
Recruiting Reserve Command (NRRC) outreach team and processed for SELRES 
affiliation.  After initial contact, NRRC will hand off transitioning 
officers to RPAC for continued processing to on ramp at their respective Navy 
Reserve Center.

4.  Additional Information.  All websites, documents and multi-media will be 
updated to reflect the name change from CTO to RPAC.  Over the course of the 
next several months, RPAC representatives will coordinate with respective 
organizations and commands to execute the necessary changes.

5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled.  
Released by Vice Admiral Richard J. Cheeseman, Jr., N1.//
