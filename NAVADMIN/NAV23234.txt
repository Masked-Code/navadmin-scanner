1.  In support of reference (a), this NAVADMIN issues guidance for officers 
interested in serving as military mentors in the Department of Defense (DoD) 
2024 Senate Youth Program. 
 
2.  As specified in reference (a), the DoD is soliciting nominations for 17 
military officers (O-2 through O-5) to serve as ambassadors of the Armed 
Forces in support of the 61st Annual United States Senate Youth Program 
(USSYP) to be hosted during the March 2-9, 2024 timeframe.  This educational 
experience for outstanding high school juniors and seniors interested in 
pursuing careers in public service was established in 1962 and is one of the 
longest standing commitments of the Office of the Secretary of Defense to a 
national youth program.  USSYP military mentors represent their individual 
Service components and serve as role models for the 104 USSYP student 
delegates, two from each state, the District of Columbia, and the Department 
of Defense Education Activity.  They exemplify the highest standards of 
decorum and protocol, facilitate inclusive and insightful debate and 
discussion among the students, and assist USSYP staff with implementation of 
the program agenda.  Each military mentor is assigned a group of student 
delegates for the duration of the program, presenting a unique opportunity 
for these bright and influential young Americans to gain a better 
understanding of DoD's mission, people, and interrelationship with the other 
branches of the federal government.  Nominees must be available for all 
training and program participation, from February 29 through March 9, 
2024.  Application requirements are specified at 
https://pa.sp.pentagon.mil/SenateYouthProgram/SitePages/Home.aspx.  The 
internal Navy deadline to apply is November 8, 2023. The Office of the 
Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs will announce 
military mentor selections by mid-January 2024.
