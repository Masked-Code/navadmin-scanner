RMKS/1. The Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC) is excited to announce 
the Annual New Years Day deck log poem contest for 2024 and calls for 
submissions by 2359 eastern daylight time, 23 February 2024. 
 
2.  Celebratory congratulations to our winners from last year. 
First place: USS Bunker Hill (CG-52) written by LT Artem Sherbinin. 
Second place: USS Fitzgerald (DDG-66) written by GM2 Austin Canterbury. 
Third place: USS Farragut (DDG-99) written by QM3 Anthony Bentley. 
Thank you to everyone that submitted entries for last year's contest. 
We look forward to reading your 2024 entries! 
 
3.  The deck log is the official record maintained by all commissioned U.S. 
Navy vessels. While regulations normally restrict the types of entries in 
logbooks, the Navy has long held the tradition of the midnight New Years 
poem. The first entry of the New Year, written in verse, allows Sailors to 
express their creativity, experience of shipboard life, and pride in their 
command. To highlight this unique tradition, NHHC will host a New Years Day 
deck log poem contest.  Sailors, we want to hear your voice. 
 
4.  Reviving aspects of our heritage like this time-honored tradition 
enhances our warfighting effectiveness. As we focus on the future, we will 
value and celebrate our heritage. Harkening back to our heritage connects us 
with the generations of Sailors that came before us, creating a sense of 
belonging and responsibility to uphold their legacy of valor and sacrifice. 
 
5. The focus of this contest is to celebrate the voices of our Sailors and to 
preserve this navy tradition. The contest also reminds the fleet of the 
importance of the deck log as a historical document, one that preserves for 
future generations the actions and voices of our Sailors.
