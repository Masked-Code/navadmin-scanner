5.  Eligibility:
    a.  Designated Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers through the grade

    b.  The preferred Unrestricted Line (URL) (13XX) aviators are junior 
officers (O2 or O3) with forecasted timing to complete the selected TPS 
program and a 24-month to 36-month follow-on test tour prior to their expected 
department head tour.  In the event that there are insufficient quantities of 
qualified URL junior officers to meet requirements, URL lieutenant commanders 
with exceptional records may be selected, provided they would still be able to 
meet applicable career milestones.
    c.  Due to current community shortfalls, VFA Naval Aviators
(1310) and VFA Naval Flight Officers (1320) junior to lineal number
15180500 or on their first fleet sea tour will be considered for selection.  
Additionally, VFA lieutenant commanders who have completed or will complete 
their department head or equivalent tour prior to TPS initial training start 
date will be considered.
    d.  Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer (1510) aviators through the grade 
of lieutenant commander may be selected if able to serve a 24-month to 36-
month follow-on test tour and continue to meet career milestones.
    e.  Applicants determined to have insufficient career timing to complete 
USNTPS and a minimum 24-month follow-on test tour may have their application 
removed from consideration prior to the board convening.

6.  Applicants should periodically check for updates and additional 
information at the TPS board website:  http://www.npc.navy.mil/
