RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces revised nuclear Enlisted Supervisor 
Retention Pay (ESRP) award levels and supersedes reference (a).
Selective reenlistment bonus (SRB) award levels for nuclear-trained Sailors 
are published separately in line with reference (b) with updates posted on 
MyNavy Portal (MNP) under the *SRB* tab at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/pay-and-benefits.  The ESRP program provides a 
retention incentive to senior Navy nuclear-trained enlisted Sailors with 
highly specialized skills.  The legal authority for ESRP is contained in 
section 331 of reference (c).
Current ESRP requirements limit the program as follows:
    a.  The minimum reenlistment length is 3 years.
    b.  The maximum bonus amount for each year of additional obligated 
service (AOS) is limited to 30,000 dollars as stated in section 331 of 
reference (c).  The implication of this limit is that to earn a 100,000-
dollar bonus the minimum AOS required is 40 months.
    c.  The maximum lifetime bonus amount is 360,000 dollars.
    d.  All ESRP payments must be received prior to completion of 26 years of 
service (YOS).  The implication of this limit is that any ESRP installment 
that would be due after 26 YOS will be paid in the final installment prior to 
completion of 26 YOS.

2.  ESRP Award Multiples.  Increased award levels are effective immediately 
and decreased levels are effective 30 days after the release of this 
NAVADMIN.  Updated ESRP multiple values for Zone 1 (at least 10, but not more 
than 14 YOS), Zone 2 (at least 14, but not more than 18 YOS) and Zone 3 (at 
least 18, but not more than 23
YOS) in line with reference (d) are listed below:
    a.  ESRP Zone 1 and Zone 2 award level updates (AOS computation stops at 
completion 16 YOS for Zone 1 and 18 YOS for Zone 2):

3.  Eligibility.  Only Sailors assigned as an active supervisor Navy enlisted 
classification (NEC) listed in paragraph 2 are eligible to reenlist for ESRP.  
In addition, Service Members must hold a current security clearance or in an 
open status for a new investigation.
ESRP requests and anniversary payments for personnel with inactive NECs 
(N59X/N89X) will be held in abeyance pending final resolution.
Overall ESRP eligibility requirements are defined in reference (d).
In addition, to encourage career progression and provide incentive for 
continued superior at-sea service, the following supplementary eligibility 
requirements remain in place for each ESRP zone:
    a.  ESRP Zone 1.  In addition to the requirements of reference (d), be 
assigned an active nuclear supervisor NEC (see paragraph 2).
    b.  ESRP Zone 2.  In addition to the requirements of reference (d), be a 
frocked E-7 or in the paygrade of E-7, E-8 or E-9 on the date of the ESRP 
Zone 2 reenlistment.
    c.  ESRP Zone 3.  In addition to the requirements of reference
(d):
        (1) Be a frocked E-8 or in the paygrade of E-8 or E-9 on the date of 
the ESRP Zone 3 reenlistment and
        (2) Have successfully previously served as, be currently serving as 
(on orders), or have been issued and accepted orders as a submarine 
engineering department master chief, nuclear aircraft carrier (CVN) major 
division leading chief petty officer, CVN reactor training division officer 
or CVN reactor department master chief.
    4.  Application Process.  To ensure the approval message is released in a 
timely manner, ESRP reenlistment requests will be submitted 35 to 120 days in 
advance of the desired reenlistment date.  Exceptions to this policy will be 
approved by the ESRP program manager on an individual basis.
    a.  Officer Personnel Information System (OPINS) and Force Management 
System is programmed to process ESRP reenlistment requests and employs the 
same process used to request and approve SRB reenlistment requests.  Career 
counselors and personnel support detachments are familiar with this program 
and should use it as the primary method of ESRP request submission.  The ESRP 
request type is 3AA for Sailors on active-duty and 3BB for broken service 
requests.
    b.  If OPINS is not available, the command can e-mail (scanned copy of 
request) or mail the request directly to the ESRP program manager using the 
format found in reference (d).  If operational commitments limit the ability 
to submit ESRP applications via this manner, commands should submit the ESRP 
request via message to the immediate superior in charge, who can submit the 
OPINS request.
ESRP requests sent directly to the ESRP program manager by message or mail 
may result in a processing delay.
    c.  E-6 and below Zone 1 Sailors not already obligated beyond 14 YOS will 
require an approved career waypoints reenlistment (C-WAY-REEN) quota.  
Sailors selected for advancement or frocked to chief petty officer do not 
require an approved C-WAY-REEN quota.  C-WAY submission and quota approval 
can be pursued in parallel with the OPINS request for ESRP.
    d.  A Sailor must be pre-approved for an ESRP reenlistment.
ESRP approval will not currently notify the Defense Joint Military Pay System 
(DJMS) of the intent of the Sailor to reenlist.  Until DJMS can be programmed 
to accept ESRP reenlistment payments, manual processing is required.  
Payments should post to the account of the Sailor within 14 days following 
the day the ESRP program manager receives notification of reenlistment.  
Initial payment will be authorized as soon as the contract execution is 
reflected in the enlisted master file (EMF).  In order to ensure prompt 
payment, new contracts must be posted to the EMF in a timely manner.
    e.  Personnel support detachments and commands should contact Officer and 
Enlisted Nuclear Programs Branch (OPNAV N133), as opposed to Defense Finance 
and Accounting System to resolve any payment issues.
    f.  A Sailor with an approved pre-certification who does not reenlist on 
the date specified in the pre-certification message must resubmit a request 
to revise the reenlistment date and ESRP award amount.
    g.  ESRP eligible Sailors and their command career counselors should 
review reference (d), which provides further program details.
Reference (d) and other helpful information can be accessed via MNP at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning, select the *Enlisted 
Community Managers* link, then select the *Nuclear* tab in the gray banner.

5.  Officer Programs.  ESRP entitlement for Sailors who reenlist after 
applying for an officer program will be held pending selection results.  For 
limited duty officer, the application deadline is considered the suspense 
date as published in reference (e) and future announcement messages.  For all 
other commissioning programs, the date on which OPNAV N133 approves the 
conditional release to apply for that program is the date after which 
additional ESRP entitlements will be held.

6.  Recoupment.  Repayment policy is governed by section 373 of reference 
(c), DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR) Chapter 2, Volume 7A, and 
reference (d), which collectively determines when repayment of the unearned 
portion of a bonus is required or not required, but left to Secretarial 
discretion or is prohibited.
Section 373 of reference (c), U.S. Code requires repayment with certain 
exceptions.  As a general rule, repayment of any unearned portion of a bonus 
will be sought.  Examples of situations requiring repayment are provided in 
reference (d).

7.  Service Record Entry.  An Administrative Remarks, NAVPERS 1070/613, entry 
acknowledging recoupment policy via Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System 
is required in the record of the Service Member prior to execution of an ESRP 
reenlistment (examples are provided in reference (d)).

8.  The point of contact is the ESRP Program Manager located at OPNAV N133 at 
(703) 604-5502/DSN 664 or via e-mail at nxag_n133d3(at)navy.mil or 
bullnuke(at)navy.mil.

9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
