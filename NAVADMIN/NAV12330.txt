SUBJ/UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS BIRTHDAY 2012//

RMKS/1.  FROM THE UNITED STATES NAVY TO THE UNITED STATES MARINE
 CORPS:  HAPPY 237TH BIRTHDAY!

2.  EACH YEAR, ON THE 10TH OF NOVEMBER, ALL MEMBERS OF THE SEA SERVICES LOOK 
BACK ON A TRADITION OF JOINT WARFIGHTING AS OLD AS OUR NATION ITSELF.  THE 
NAVY-MARINE CORPS PARTNERSHIP IS STRONGER THAN EVER AND REMAINS A CONSTANT AND 
VITAL PART OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.
  OVER THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE BEEN REINVIGORATING NAVY-MARINE CORPS AMPHIBIOUS 
SKILLS DURING REAL WORLD OPERATIONS AND EXERCISES SUCH AS BOLD ALLIGATOR.  
LOOKING AHEAD, WE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD UPON THESE OPERATIONS AND DEVELOP 
STRATEGIES AND CAPABILITIES OF SEA CONTROL AND POWER PROJECTION.

3.  I JOIN SAILORS AROUND THE WORLD IN SALUTING OUR PRIMARY PARTNER.
 WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER THOSE THAT MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE:  IT IS UPON 
THEIR SHOULDERS AND COUNTLESS OTHER BRAVE MARINES THAT THE PROUD LEGACY OF THE 
MARINE CORPS HAS BEEN BUILT.

4.  THE MARINE CORPS MOTTO SAYS IT ALL, "SEMPER FI."  THE NAVY IS GRATEFUL AND 
HONORED TO SERVE BESIDE YOU.  HAPPY 237TH BIRTHDAY TO YOU, AND TO YOUR 
FAMILIES.

5.     ADMIRAL JONATHAN W. GREENERT, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.
