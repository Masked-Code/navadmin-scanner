RMKS/1. THIS YEAR'S ARMY/NAVY GAME IS SCHEDULED FOR SATURDAY,
6 DECEMBER 2008 AT LINCOLN FINANCIAL FIELD IN PHILADELPHIA, 
PENNSYLVANIA. CBS SPORTS WILL TELEVISE THE GAME AND WILL ONCE AGAIN 
ACCEPT "GO NAVY" AND/OR "BEAT ARMY" VIDEO SPOTS FROM THE NAVY/MARINE 
CORPS TEAM FOR BROADCAST DURING THE GAME. THIS TRADITIONAL FOOTBALL 
GAME OFFERS AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR SAILORS AND MARINES TO 
DISPLAY THEIR TEAM SPIRIT BEFORE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS.
2. REQUIREMENTS: ALL SPOTS MUST INCLUDE THE SUBMITTING COMMAND'S NAME, 
IDENTIFY COMMAND'S LOCATION, AND INCLUDE A "GO NAVY" AND/OR "BEAT ARMY" 
THEME. AVOID USE OF NAVY JARGON OR ACRONYMS.
A. SPOTS SHOULD BE BROADCAST QUALITY IN ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
FORMATS: BETA SP, DVCAM OR DVC PRO. FIRST-GENERATION TAPES ONLY.
B. SPOTS MUST BE NO MORE THAN 30 SECONDS IN LENGTH.
C. VHS TAPES AND DVDS CREATED FROM VHS, HI-8, DIGITAL HI-8 OR CONSUMER 
GRADE VIDEO CAMERAS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE.
D. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SUCCESS: EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT SUBMISSIONS 
MOST LIKELY TO BE TELEVISED ARE THOSE EXHIBITING ENTHUSIASM, HUMOR, 
CREATIVITY, AND MOTIVATION. THIS YEAR, WE ARE LOOKING FOR MORE SKITS, 
CARTOONS, ETC., INSTEAD OF THE GENERIC GO-NAVY-BEAT-ARMY CALL-OUTS.
E. SUBMIT ONLY READY-TO-AIR SPOTS. NEITHER CBS NOR DEFENSE MEDIA 
ACTIVITY ANACOSTIA WILL EDIT SUBMISSIONS.
F. FRAME SHOTS ACCORDING TO RULES OF GOOD COMPOSITION (AVOID TALKING 
HEADS WITH NO BODIES).
G. ALLOW ABOUT 10 SECONDS OF LEAD-IN BEFORE THE SPOT STARTS AND THE 
SAME AT THE END OF THE SPOT.
H. CUE TAPE FOR VIEWING.
I. HIGH AUDIO QUALITY AND SHARP FOCUS ARE PARAMOUNT. POOR AUDIO QUALITY 
WAS A PRIMARY REASON FOR REJECTION OF PAST ENTRIES.
3. SUPPORT FROM THE FLEET PUBLIC AFFAIRS CENTERS, DEFENSE MEDIA 
ACTIVITY DETACHMENTS, IF AVAILABLE, OR BROADCAST DETACHMENTS ARE 
PERMISSIBLE ON A NOT-TO-INTERFERE WITH OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS BASIS.
4. COMMANDS SHOULD SEND ORIGINAL, BROADCAST QUALITY FOOTAGE BY EXPRESS 
SHIPMENT OR FASTEST METHOD AVAILABLE TO THE DEFENSE MEDIA ACTIVITY 
ANACOSTIA ASSIGNMENT DESK. SUBMISSIONS POSTMARKED AFTER 21 NOVEMBER 
2008 WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. SEND

GAME, 2713 MITSCHER ROAD SW, BLDG 168, ANACOSTIA ANNEX, DC 20373-5819. 
SUBMISSION VIA TELESTREAM OR FTP IS ALSO POSSIBLE. CONTACT POC FOR 
DETAILS.
5. REQUEST WIDEST POSSIBLE DISSEMINATION OF THIS MESSAGE. THIS IS AN 
EXCELLENT MEANS OF HIGHLIGHTING NAVY TEAMWORK AND THE SPIRIT OF OUR 
DEPLOYED SAILORS AND MARINES. GO NAVY, BEAT ARMY.
