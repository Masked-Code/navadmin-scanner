NARR/REF A IS OPNAVINST 5726.8 THAT STIPULATES REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMUNITY 
OUTREACH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NAVAL HISTORY. REF B IS 2011 NAVY WEEKS WARNORD 
THAT AMPLIFIES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NAVY WEEKS IN 2011, OUR FLAGSHIP 
EXPEDITIONARY OUTREACH EFFORT LED BY THE NAVY OFFICE OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH 
(NAVCO), A CHIEF OF INFORMATION (CHINFO) FIELD ACTIVITY.//

RMKS/ 1. THIS MESSAGE ANNOUNCES THE 2011 CALENDAR FOR AMERICA (CFA11) , 
DETAILING THE NAVY'S LARGE-SCALE CONUS OUTREACH EVENTS FOR THE COMING YEAR.
EVENTS INCLUDE, NAVY WEEKS, FLEET WEEKS, DIVERSITY EVENTS, CENTENNIAL OF NAVAL 
AVIATION TIER 1 EVENTS, BLUE ANGEL AIR SHOWS, SHIP COMMISSIONING CEREMONIES, 
AND KEY RECRUITING EVOLUTIONS AMONG OTHERS.

2. INFORMING AND EDUCATING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ABOUT THE CAPABILITY, 
IMPORTANCE AND VALUE OF TODAY'S NAVY IS AN ESSENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THOSE 
WHO SERVE. EFFECTIVE OUTREACH IS ALSO KEY TO CREATING POSITIVE AWARENESS AMONG 
INFLUENCERS OF YOUTH, WHICH NOT ONLY TRANSLATES TO GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF 
THE NAVY, BUT OFTEN TO INCREASED RECRUITING AND RETENTION. BECAUSE OUR PRIMARY 
FLEET CONCENTRATION AREAS ARE ON BOTH COASTS, COMMUNICATING OUR MISSION AND 
CONTRIBUTION TO OUR NATION'S SECURITY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IS A PARTICULAR 
AND UNIQUE CHALLENGE. THIS IS WHY THE EVENTS DELINEATED IN CFA11 ARE SO 
IMPORTANT.

3. THE POLICY AND THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN REFS A AND B, AND THE MANY 
TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES CONTAINED THEREIN WILL ENHANCE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF 
THE NAVY'S MISSION, CONTRIBUTION TO NATIONAL SECURITY, AND OUR PERSONNEL AND 
OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE, ESPECIALLY IN NON-FLEET CONCENTRATION AREAS.
CFA11 IS
A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THIS EFFORT, PROVIDING A COORDINATED AND FOCUSED 
DEMONSTRATION OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH EVENTS ACROSS THE NATION. CFA11 WILL HELP 
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE EXTRAORDINARY PROFESSIONALISM, EXCELLENCE, BRAVERY AND 
DEDICATION OF OUR MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE.

4. CFA11 OUTREACH EVENTS ARE SCHEDULED AS FOLLOWS (READ IN FOUR
