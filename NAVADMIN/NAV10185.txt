RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN, THE SEVENTH IN A SERIES ON THE JOINT 
QUALIFICATION SYSTEM (JQS), ANNOUNCES THE APPROACHING DEADLINE FOR 
OFFICERS TO APPLY FOR RETROACTIVE JOINT CREDIT.  

2.  PER REFS A THROUGH F, THE JQS REPLACES THE PREVIOUS DESIGNATION OF 
JOINT SPECIALTY OFFICER (JSO) WITH THE DESIGNATION OF JOINT QUALIFIED 
OFFICER (JQO).  OFFICERS CONTINUE TO BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE JOINT 
PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION (JPME) PHASES I AND II FOR DESIGNATION 
AS JQO (RESERVISTS WILL GENERALLY COMPLETE ADVANCED JPME FOR PHASE II).  
ALTHOUGH THE PRIMARY MEANS TO ACHIEVE JOINT QUALIFICATION WILL CONTINUE 
TO BE THROUGH AN ASSIGNMENT TO A PERMANENT BILLET LISTED ON THE JOINT 
DUTY ASSIGNMENT LIST (JDAL), THE JQS ALLOWS OFFICERS TO ACCUMULATE 
POINTS TOWARDS JOINT QUALIFICATION THROUGH JOINT EXPERIENCE, JOINT 
TRAINING/EDUCATION AND JOINT EXERCISES. 

3.  EXPERIENCE POINTS:  PER REFS A THROUGH H, OFFICERS IN THE GRADE OF 
O1 TO O6 MAY SUBMIT THEIR JOINT EXPERIENCES THROUGH THE JQS SELF-
NOMINATION WEBSITE, LOCATED AT 
HTTPS://WWW.DMDC.OSD.MIL/APPJ/JMIS/JQSINDEX.JSP
(ALL LOWER CASE EXCEPT JQS), FOR CONSIDERATION OF CREDIT BY THE JQS 
EXPERIENCE REVIEW PANEL.  THE WEBSITE PROVIDES DIRECTIONS FOR SELF-
NOMINATION, AS WELL AS THE PROCESS FOR SENDING SUPPORTING DATA FOR THE 
JOINT CREDIT REQUEST.

4.  RETROACTIVE CREDIT.  THE JQS PROGRAM BECAME EFFECTIVE
1 OCTOBER 2007 AND ENABLED ACTIVE COMPONENT (AC) AND RESERVE COMPONENT 
(RC) OFFICERS TO SELF-NOMINATE JOINT EXPERIENCES TOWARD JOINT CREDIT.  
PER REF G, A RETROACTIVE PERIOD WAS ESTABLISHED TO SUPPORT THE INITIAL 
START-UP OF THE JQS PROGRAM AND AFFORD OFFICERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
APPLY FOR CREDIT IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY WERE GAINING JOINT 
WARFIGHTING EXPERIENCE AND SUPPORTING THE WAR ON TERRORISM. 
    A.  BOTH ACTIVE AND RESERVE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT PACKAGES FOR EXPERIENCE TOURS RETROACTIVE TO 11 
SEPTEMBER 2001.
    B.  ALL AC OFFICERS WITH JOINT EXPERIENCES OCCURRING BETWEEN
11 SEPTEMBER 2001 AND 30 SEPTEMBER 2009 MUST SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATION 
NO LATER THAN 30 SEPTEMBER 2010.  AFTER 30 SEPTEMBER 2010, AC OFFICERS 
WILL HAVE ONE YEAR FROM COMPLETION DATE OF THEIR JOINT EXPERIENCE TO 
SELF-NOMINATE THEIR JOINT EXPERIENCE FOR PROCESSING.  THE REQUEST FOR 
EXPERIENCE CREDIT ONLY HAS TO BE SUBMITTED AND NOT ADJUDICATED PRIOR TO 
THE RETROACTIVE DEADLINE.  
    C.  PER REF H, THE RETROACTIVE PERIOD FOR RC OFFICERS WAS RECENTLY 
EXTENDED TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2013.  ADDITIONALLY, RESERVE OFFICERS MAY 
SUBMIT PACKAGES FOR EXPERIENCE TOURS IN A JDAL-TYPE BILLET (OSD, JOINT 
STAFF, OR COCOM HEADQUARTERS) RETROACTIVE TO 1 OCTOBER 1986, IF THEY 
WERE SERVING IN A RESERVE STATUS AT THE TIME OF EXPERIENCE.

5.  THE DATES OF FUTURE CALENDAR YEAR 2010 JQS REVIEW PANELS ARE 3-4
