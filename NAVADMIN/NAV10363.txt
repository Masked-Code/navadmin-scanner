SUBJ/2010 CHAPLAIN CORPS ANNIVERSARY MESSAGE//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE 2010 ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF 
THE UNITED STATES NAVY CHAPLAIN CORPS ON 28 NOVEMBER 1775.  FOR 235 
YEARS, THE CHAPLAIN CORPS HAS SERVED WITH UNWAVERING DEDICATION.  ITS 
HISTORY PARALLELS THAT OF OUR NAVY.  SINCE 1775, NAVY CHAPLAINS HAVE 
BEEN STEADY AND RELIABLE SPIRITUAL LEADERS TO SAILORS ASHORE AND AFLOAT 
AND HAVE SERVED ALONGSIDE OF COURAGEOUS MARINES FROM THE FIERCE BATTLES 
OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR TO THE HARSH DESERTS OF AFGHANISTAN.  WITH THE 
SAME DEVOTION, CHAPLAINS HAVE PROVIDED MEMBERS OF THE COAST GUARD AND 
THEIR FAMILIES WITH INVALUABLE RELIGIOUS MINISTRY AND SPIRITUAL SUPPORT.  
NAVY CHAPLAINS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THERE, SOMETIMES THANKLESSLY, ALWAYS 
UNSELFISHLY.  2.
TOGETHER WITH RELIGIOUS PROGRAM SPECIALISTS, CHAPLAINS HAVE CONTRIBUTED 
IMMEASURABLY TO THE NAVY'S CAPACITY TO BE A GLOBAL FORCE FOR GOOD.  
THEIRS IS A HISTORY OF FAITHFUL SERVICE THAT GOES BACK MORE THAN TWO 
CENTURIES AND WILL CONTINUE UNABATED IN THE FUTURE AS OUR FORCES FACE 
FRESH CHALLENGES REQUIRING EVEN GREATER RESILIENCE.

3.  I AM PROUD TO SERVE WITH AND TO RECOGNIZE NAVY CHAPLAINS FOR ALL 
THEY DO TO ASSURE THE WELL BEING OF OUR SERVICEMEMBERS AND THEIR 
FAMILIES.  WITH SINCERITY AND PROFOUND GRATITUDE, ON BEHALF OF ALL NAVAL 
PERSONNEL AND THEIR FAMILIES, I EXTEND A VERY "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" TO THE 
MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY CHAPLAIN CORPS.
