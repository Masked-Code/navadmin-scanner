SUBJ/2014 DIVERSITY HERITAGE CELEBRATIONS AND NATIONAL OBSERVANCES//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the remaining Diversity Heritage 
Celebrations and National Observances for calendar year 2014.

2.  All commands are strongly encouraged to increase their knowledge and 
awareness of Diversity Heritage Celebrations and National Observances by 
supporting programs, exhibits, publications, and participating in military 
and community events throughout the year.

3.  List of Diversity Heritage Celebrations and National Observances: 

a.  Days of Remembrance/Holocaust Remembrance Day 
Theme:  Confronting the Holocaust:  American Responses 
Dates:  27 April-4 May 2014/28 April 2014 
The Holocaust was the state-sponsored systematic annihilation of European 
Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators.  Between 1933 and 1945, more than 
six million Jews were murdered while Poles, Soviet prisoners of war, gypsies, 
Jehovah's Witnesses, political dissidents, the physically and mentally 
disabled, and homosexuals suffered grievous persecution under Nazi tyranny.
Established by Congress in 1980 as the nation's annual commemoration of the 
Holocaust, the Days of Remembrance includes the observance of "Yom Hashoah," 
or Holocaust Remembrance Day. 

b.  Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month 
Theme:  I Am Beyond
Dates:  1-31 May 2014 
Directed by Congress in 1977 and established by presidential proclamation in 
1978, Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week was first observed the week of 4 
May 1979.  In 1990, President George H. W. Bush expanded the observance to 
encompass the month of May; and in 1992, Congress passed a law permanently 
designating May as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month.  The month of May 
is significant for this observance as it commemorates the arrival date of the 
first Japanese immigrants to the United States on 7 May 1843 and the 
significant contributions from Chinese pioneers completing the first 
Transcontinental Railroad on 10 May 1869. 

c.  Women's Equality Day 
Theme:  Celebrating Women's Right to Vote 
Dates:  26 August 2014 
Women's Equality Day commemorates the struggle of women to gain the right to 
vote.  The movement for women's rights was launched on a national level in 
1848 at what is now known as The Seneca Falls Convention, which originally 
advertised itself as a "Women's Rights Convention."  Voting rights advocates 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, also known as "suffragists," along 
with Susan B. Anthony and other activists, formed organizations that raised 
public awareness and lobbied the government to grant voting rights to women 
making the right to vote a centerpiece of the women's rights movement.  It 
would take 72 years after the suffrage movement began for these groups to 
emerge victorious with the ratification of the 19th Amendment tothe U.S. 
Constitution on 18 August 1920, which prohibited any U.S. citizen from being 
denied the right to vote on the basis of sex.  On Election Day that same 
year, more than eight million women across the nation voted for the first 
time.  In 1971, to honor and commemorate this historic event, Congresswoman 
Bella Abzug (D-NY) introduced, and Congress signed, a resolution to designate 
26 August as Women's Equality Day recognizing the anniversary of suffrage and 
of women's continued efforts toward equal rights.

d.  Navy Suicide Prevention Month
Theme:  "Every Sailor, Every Day"
Dates:  1 - 30 September 2014
Since 1974, the American Association of Suicidology has recognized the week 
of September 10th as National Suicide Prevention Week.  Since 2012 the 
Department of Defense has expanded this effort, devoting the entire month of 
September to promoting sustainable community-wide approaches to suicide 
prevention education and awareness.  Navy uses Suicide Prevention Month as a 
launch-pad for continuous engagement throughout the year, providing Sailors, 
leaders, commands and families with the tools to effectively navigate through 
stressful times while supporting help-seeking behavior.  This year's theme, 
"Every Sailor, Every Day," reinforces this ongoing approach by encouraging 
all members of the Navy community to reach out to another and take meaningful 
actions to promote cohesion, build trust, and help fellow shipmates thrive in 
the face of adversity, not just survive.  Supporting resources and 
communications will be available in September at www.suicide.navy.mil to 
support commanders and unit Suicide Prevention Coordinators tailoring local 
initiatives.  We are stronger together. 

e.  Hispanic Heritage Month Theme:  
Please visit www.hispanicheritagemonth.org for updates.
Dates:  15 September-15 October 2014 
Each year, Americans observe National Hispanic Heritage Month from 15 
September to 15 October, by celebrating the histories, cultures, and 
contributions of American citizens whose ancestors came from Spain, Mexico, 
the Caribbean and Central and South America.  The observation started in 1968 
as Hispanic Heritage Week under President Lyndon Johnson and was expanded by 
President Ronald Reagan in 1988 to cover a 30-day period.  It was enacted 
into law on 17 August 1988, by the approval of Public Law 100-402. 

f.  National Prisoner of War (POW)/Missing in Action (MIA) Recognition Day 
Theme:  Please visit www.dtic.mil/dpmo for updates 
Date:   19 September 2014 
The President of the United States issues an annual proclamation 
commemorating this national day of observance.  Americans are to offer 
remembrance, honor, and reverence to those who were a POW and to over 33,000 
Sailors who remain MIA from our nation's wars.  It is also a day we remember 
the families of POW/MIA and the sacrifices they have endured.  

g.  National American Indian Heritage Month 
Theme:Please visit www.nativeamericanheritagemonth.org for updates. 
Dates:  1-30 November 2014 
Native American Heritage Month first began with the establishment of American 
Indian Day by the governor of New York in May 1916.  Later, several 
additional states enacted celebrations during the fourth Friday in September, 
but the celebration did not gain official national recognition until 
President George H. W. Bush approved a joint resolution designating November 
1990 as "National American Indian Heritage Month."  Similar proclamations 
under different names, including "Native 
American Heritage Month" and "National American Indian and Alaska Native 
Heritage Month," have been issued each year since 1994.
