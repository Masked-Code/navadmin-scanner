GENTEXT/REMARKS////
RMKS/1.  REF A ESTABLISHES A NEW DOD READINESS REPORTING SYSTEM
(DRRS) THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS REPORTING
MECHANISMS.  THE BASIS OF READINESS ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING WILL BE
CENTERED ON THE ABILITY TO ACCOMPLISH ASSIGNED MISSIONS AS DESCRIBED
THROUGH THE CONSTRUCT OF MISSION ESSENTIAL TASKS (METS).  THIS NEW
REPORTING SCHEME WILL STANDARDIZE REPORTING AMONG ALL SERVICES AS
WELL AS DOD AGENCIES.  A KEY COMPONENT WILL BE ENHANCED STATUS OF
RESOURCES AND TRAINING SYSTEM (ESORTS), WHICH REPLACES SORTS AND
FOCUSES ON FORCE CAPABILITIES, AUGMENTED BY CURRENT RESOURCE STATUS.
A.  NAVY WILL REPORT AT SEVERAL LEVELS OF OPERATIONAL COMMAND
FROM SERVICE COMPONENT HEADQUARTERS, DOWN TO DEPLOYABLE ENTITIES.
OTHER ACTIVITIES WITH DIRECT MISSION OR WAR FIGHTER SUPPORT
RESPONSIBILITIES WILL ALSO BE INCLUDED AS DRRS REPORTING
ORGANIZATIONS.  EXAMPLES INCLUDE INSTALLATIONS, TRAINING RANGES, KEY
TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES AND DEPOTS.  INITIAL FOCUS FOR
IMPLEMENTATION WILL BE ON EXISTING SORTS REPORTING ORGANIZATIONS.

2.  DEFENSE READINESS REPORTING SYSTEM-NAVY (DRRS-N) IS THE NAVY'S
FUTURE MET/CAPABILITIES-BASED READINESS REPORTING SYSTEM.  DRRS-N IS
CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT AT FLEET FORCES COMMAND (FFC) UNDER
SPONSORSHIP OF OPNAV N4 TO ASSESS NAVY UNIT READINESS DATA AND
COMPLY FULLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE DRRS REPORTING
REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED IN REF A.  DRRS-N IS THE TOOL NAVY
ORGANIZATIONS WILL USE TO REPORT MET READINESS DATA TO OFFICE OF
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE DRRS.  DRRS-N WILL CONSIST OF A DATA COLLECTION
TOOL AND AN ANALYSIS AND DISPLAY APPLICATION.  THE TYCOM READINESS
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (TRMS) WILL REMAIN THE AUTHORITATIVE SYSTEM FOR
NAVY READINESS REPORTING UNTIL DRRS-N ABSORBS TRMS FUNCTIONALITY AND
REPLACES EXISTING TRMS REPORTING TOOLS IN FISCAL YEAR 2007 (FY-07).
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WILL BE PROVIDED SEPCOR.
3.  REF A TASKED SERVICES TO DEVELOP MISSION ESSENTIAL TASKS (METS)
TO SUPPORT CAPABILITIES-BASED READINESS REPORTING IN DRRS.  NAVY
METS (NMETS) FOR OPERATIONAL UNITS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE FLEET
AND ARE STORED IN THE NAVY TRAINING INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
(NTIMS).  NTIMS IS INTEGRATED AND CONSISTENT WITH DRRS-N
ARCHITECTURE AND FULFILLS THE DRRS MET REQUIREMENTS PER REF A.
4.  REF B DIRECTS SERVICES TO IMPLEMENT MET-BASED REPORTING IN DRRS



PAGE 04 RUEWMFU7913 UNCLAS
BY 30 SEP 05.  THE NAVY WILL IMPLEMENT THIS REQUIREMENT IN THREE
PHASES.
A.  PHASE ONE - DRRS-N INTERIM SORTS-BASED REPORTING.  CFFC HAS
DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A WEB SERVICE AS AN INTERIM TOOL THAT
AUTOMATES UNIT NMET ASSESSMENTS AND MET-BASED REPORTING USING TRMS
SORTS DATA UNTIL DRRS-N IS TESTED AND FIELDED.  THIS WEB SERVICE IS
TRANSPARENT TO SORTS USERS AND WILL NOT IMPACT CURRENT SORTS
READINESS REPORTING PROCEDURES.  THIS MEASURE WILL SATISFY THE
SEP 05 DRRS REPORTING DEADLINE.
B.  PHASE TWO - DRRS-N COMMANDERS ASSESSMENT.  FFC WILL DELIVER
A TOOL WITHIN DRRS-N TO ENABLE COMMANDERS AT ALL LEVELS TO ASSESS
THEIR ORGANIZATIONS ABILITY TO CONDUCT ASSIGNED MISSION(S).
ASSESSMENT WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH MISSION ESSENTIAL TASKS,
INCLUDING ESTABLISHED STANDARDS AND CONDITIONS.  SORTS/TRMS
OPERATIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED UNTIL THE
SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF DRRS-N PHASE TWO.  AFTER THE DRRS-N TOOL IS
IMPLEMENTED AND READINESS REPORTING UNITS ARE FULLY TRAINED, ALL
OPERATIONAL UNITS WILL TRANSITION TO THE DRRS-N REPORTING SCHEME.
THIS PHASE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED DURING FY-06.
C.  PHASE THREE - DRRS-N RULE-BASED ASSESSMENT.  TO SUPPLEMENT



PAGE 05 RUEWMFU7913 UNCLAS
THE COMMANDERS ASSESSMENT, FFC PLANS TO DEVELOP A TOOL TO
AUTOMATICALLY AGGREGATE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE RESOURCE
INFORMATION FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES TO PROVIDE AN ASSESSMENT OF
READINESS TO CARRY OUT MISSIONS AND ASSIGNED TASKS.  THIS PHASE OF
DEVELOPMENT IS INTENDED TO ASSIST OPERATORS AND DECISION MAKERS AND
IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FFC TOTAL FORCE INTEGRATED READINESS MODEL
(TFIRM) PROJECT, CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT.  THIS PHASE SHOULD
REACH INITIAL OPERATING CAPABILITY IN EARLY FY-07.
5.  ACTION:  SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF DRRS-N WILL REQUIRE A
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF WORK AND SUPPORT FROM ALL ECHELONS OF
COMMAND.  UNDERSTANDING ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AT ALL LEVELS IS
VITAL TO SUCCESSFUL DRRS-N IMPLEMENTATION AND FULL COMPLIANCE WITH
DOD MANDATED DRRS.  ALL NAVY TYPE COMMANDERS, NUMBERED FLEET
COMMANDERS, ASSIGNED FLEET COMMANDERS, TRAINING STRIKE GROUPS, SORTS
REPORTERS, AND READINESS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ARE DIRECTED TO:
A.  REVIEW THE DOD GUIDANCE AND REVIEW OWN AND SUBORDINATE
ORGANIZATION STATUS WRT NMETL DEVELOPMENT.
B.  FOR ORGANIZATIONS WITH METL DATA IN NTIMS, REVIEW AND
UPDATE AS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE MOST ACCURATE INFORMATION IS
PRESENTED.

C.  FOR REPORTING ORGANIZATIONS IDENTIFIED IN PARA 1.A WITH NO
METL DATA IN NTIMS, COMPLETE METL DEVELOPMENT NLT 31 DEC 05.
D.  COORDINATE WITH THE FFC TFIRM/DRRS-N DEVELOPMENT TEAM VIA THE
CFFC POINT OF CONTACT.
6.  FFC HAS ESTABLISHED A DRRS-N INFORMATION WEB PAGE ON THE FFC
SIPRNET WEBSITE (HTTP COLON DOUBLE-SLASH WWW.FFC.NAVY.SMIL.MIL).

READINESS AND TRAINING (N4/7) ITEM AND THEN TO THE FLEET READINESS
PROGRAMS (N40) WEB PAGE.  FROM THE NAVIGATION MENU AT LEFT, SELECT
"DRRS-N".  DIRECTIVES, MESSAGES AND INFORMATION RELATED TO DRRS-N
WILL BE POSTED AND UPDATED AS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.
7.  A DRRS-N SUPPORT CENTER HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED WHICH PROVIDES
ESSENTIAL INFORMATION AND SUPPORT DURING TRANSITION AND
IMPLEMENTATION AND IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL QUESTIONS AND TECHNICAL
SUPPORT MONDAY THRU FRIDAY, COMM: (757) 836-5241/DSN 836-5241
OR EMAIL DRRSN@NAVY.MIL.
