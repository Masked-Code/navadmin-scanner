SUBJ/247TH CHAPLAIN CORPS ANNIVERSARY MESSAGE// 
 
RMKS/1.  On 28 November 1775, the Continental Congress directed that 
divine services be held aboard all naval ships. In this act, the 
Founders recognized the importance of the spiritual in the readiness 
of Sailors and Marines. The spiritual readiness of Naval Service 
personnel for the rigors of service and the test of conflict is just 
as important today as it was 247 years ago. 
 
2.  The men and women of the Chaplain Corps continue that work today. 
At sea, ashore, and in the field, our chaplains are always there, 
always seeking the good of those they serve. Thank you for your 
legacy of care to our people. 
 
3.  Happy 247th birthday, Chaplains! 
 
4.  Released by Mr. Andrew S. Haeuptle, Director, Navy Staff on behalf of 
Rear Admiral Gregory Todd, Chief of Chaplains.//
