CLASSIFICATION CODES FOR NUCLEAR PROPULSION PLANT OPERATIONS.  REF B IS 
NAVADMIN 361/12, SEA SHORE FLOW ENLISTED CAREER PATHS UPDATES (CORRECTED 
COPY).//

RMKS/1. The Nuclear Propulsion Programs (OPNAV (N133)) and the type 
commanders (TYCOM) gathered feedback from the fleet and performed a 
comprehensive review of the nuclear enlisted sea shore flow (SSF) policy and 
the instruction that governs Navy enlisted classification
(NEC) codes for nuclear propulsion plant personnel, per reference (a).  The 
review identified that some modifications to the current SSF outlined in 
reference (a) and the policies in reference (b) are required to ensure 
continued success of the Sailors that comprise the Naval Nuclear Propulsion 
Program enterprise.  These changes increase the opportunity to obtain and 
utilize supervisory qualifications, ensure a Sailor continues on a career 
path that will set them up for success, and enhance quality of service while 
ensuring fleet and ashore manning supports the Navys mission.

2.  The major modifications to the SSF and reference (a) are as
follows:
    a.  Shortens the first sea tour from 54 months to 48 months
(40 months for Sailors who complete a junior staff instructor (JSI) tour at a 
nuclear power training unit);
    b.  Reduces the second sea tour to 40 months, 1 year after the date of 
this NAVADMIN for all pay grades.  For the first year, the second sea tour 
will be reduced to 48 months.  All remaining sea tours will be 40 months in 
length for all pay grades;
    c.  Changes the nominal shore duty tour length from 36 months to
40 months to account for the shore duties that require additional training 
and qualification time (e.g., nuclear instructor duty and radiological 
control technician).  This will match the time required to execute the 
majority of the shore duty billets our nuclear trained Sailors serve in 
during their career.  Shore duty tours that do not require additional nuclear 
qualification and training time will remain 36 months in length;
    d.  Implements two career milestone gates which serve as a distribution 
mechanism to facilitate Sailors rotating back to the second and third sea 
duty periods at the correct time in their career, to help ensure the 
requisite knowledge and experience is gained over a 20 plus year career.  The 
first gate will be at 10 years of active-duty service (a Sailor should start 
their second sea tour prior to this gate) and the second gate will be at 17 
years of active-duty service (a Sailor should start their third sea tour 
prior to this gate).  Sailors commencing their tours after the corresponding 
gates will be managed on a case-by-case basis;
    e.  Provides guidance to Enlisted Nuclear/Submarine Assignment
(PERS-403) on how to distribute Sailors who advance to E-7 on their second 
sea tour.
    f.  Factors in one month of nominal transfer time and leave between duty 
stations.  The previous SSF did not factor in this transfer time.  NOTE:  
This one month of transfer time is not included in the tour lengths listed in 
paragraphs 4 and 5; and;
    g.  The requirement to earn a supervisory NEC is reduced from six years 
of active-duty service to four years of active-duty service.  This allows our 
Sailors opportunity to earn a supervisory NEC during their first sea tour 
under the new SSF.  It will also provide commanding officers and reactor 
officers more flexibility for awarding this NEC, which will result in 
increased pay ($2,700 per year raise) for Sailors with the requisite 
supervisory skill sets.

3.  The modified SSF is displayed in paragraphs 4 and 5.  The initial 
training pipeline for all Sailors is set to a nominal length of 24 months.  
Following initial training, all Sailors will either complete a JSI tour, 
which is 24 months, or begin their first sea tour.  Sea tours are annotated 
below as SEA and shore duty is annotated as SHR.  All numbers in paragraphs 4 
and 5 are in months.
This NAVADMIN modifies the SSF outlined in reference (a) for nuclear-trained 
enlisted Sailors only.  The other ratings SSF discussed in reference (a) 
remain the same until superseded.

4.  The SSF is modified as follows for a Sailor who does NOT serve as a JSI:
SEA1 SHR1 SEA2 SHR2 SEA3 SHR3 SEA4 SHR4
 48   36   40   36   40   36   40   36
NOTE 1:  (1) PERS-403 will issue shore tour orders up to 40 months for 
billets where additional training or qualification is required.
(2) New orders to SEA2 will be 48 months for 1 year from the date of this 
NAVADMIN.  New orders to SEA2 released after 1 year past the date of this 
NAVADMIN will be 40 months.

5.  The SSF is modified as follows for a Sailor who serves as a JSI after 
completing a 24 month JSI tour:
SEA1 SHR1 SEA2 SHR2 SEA3 SHR3 SEA4 SHR4
 40   30   40   36   40   36   40   36
NOTE 2:  (1) PERS-403 will issue shore tour orders up to 40 months for 
billets where additional training or qualification is required.
(2) New orders to SEA2 will be 48 months for 1 year from the date of this 
NAVADMIN.  New orders to SEA2 released after 1 year past the date of this 
NAVADMIN will be 40 months.

6.  The career milestone gates will be utilized as follows:
    a.  PERS-403 will not delay a Sailors return to sea to align him with 
these gates;
    b.  If a Sailor is behind the nominal SSF career path and approaching a 
gate, PERS-403 will adjust the Sailors tour length when issuing orders to 
shore duty to align their planned rotation date (PRD) with the gate or obtain 
a waiver from OPNAV (N133) to exceed the gate.  A Sailors shore tour length 
would not normally need to be reduced if the nominal SSF was being executed;
    c.  PERS-403 will maintain shore tour lengths of at least 24 months (plus 
any required training/qualification period) unless a waiver is received; and
    d.  Sailors who are unable to meet a gate will be handled on a case-by-
case basis and will require a waiver submitted by PERS-403 and approved by 
OPNAV (N133).

7.  For a nuclear trained Sailor who does not advance to E-7 during their 
first shore duty, their second sea tour will normally be adjusted to allow 
the Sailor the ability to complete the leading chief petty officer tour.  In 
most cases, this will enable the Sailor to complete their engineering 
department master chief or divisional leading chief petty officer tour during 
their third sea tour prior to 20-years of service.

8.  These policy changes will require close coordination between the command, 
each nuclear-trained enlisted Sailor, and PERS-403 to facilitate a smooth 
transition to the new SSF.  Therefore, implementation of these changes will 
be phased as follows:
    a.  Effective immediately, all new orders issued by PERS-403 will comply 
with the tour lengths shown in paragraphs 4 and 5 with the exception of the 
second sea tour.  These orders will be 48 months in duration for a period of 
1 year from the date of the NAVADMIN.  After this date, all orders will be in 
accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5;
    b.  The 10-year gate will be in effect immediately upon the date of this 
NAVADMIN.  The 17-year gate will not be in effect until
1 January 2018.  Waivers will be routed if required to exceed these gates; 
and;
    c.  To allow Sailors and their families time to plan for potential future 
duty station changes, PRD changes should be made using the following 
guidance:
        (1) For Sailors on their first sea tour:
            (a) Sailors within 12 months of their previously established PRD 
will not have their PRD shifted to an earlier date, unless the Sailor routes 
an Enlisted Personnel Action Request (NAVPERS 1306/7) that is endorsed by the 
command specifically requesting the PRD change;
            (b) Sailors within 12-18 months of their PRD will have their PRD 
shifted to 12 months from the date of this message, unless otherwise 
requested by the command; and;
            (c) Sailors who are greater than 18 months from their PRD will 
have their PRDs shifted to align with the new SSF.
        (2) For Sailors on their second sea tour:
            (a) Sailors within 12 months of their previously established PRD 
will not have their PRD shifted to an earlier date, unless the Sailor routes 
a NAVPERS 1306/7 that is endorsed by the command specifically requesting the 
PRD change;
            (b) Sailors within 12-18 months of their PRD will have their PRD 
shifted to 12 months from the date of this message, unless otherwise 
requested by the command; and;
            (c) Sailors that are greater than 18 months from their PRD will 
have their tour shortened to 48 months.
        (3) For all other Sailors (either on sea or shore duty), commands 
should develop their personnel rotation plans to maintain adequate experience 
and manning levels, while maximizing support of the new SSF.
    d.  Within three months of the date of this message, all commands shall 
submit a PRD planning letter or message to PERS-403 using the guidance of 
paragraph 8c.  PERS-403 will then adjudicate waivers to the career milestone 
gates based on the information received.
    e.  Effective immediately, commands may submit requests to award a 
supervisory NEC to Sailors who have at least four years of active- duty 
service, have completed the TYCOM approved supervisory NEC qualification 
card, and have completed all other requirements in reference (b).
