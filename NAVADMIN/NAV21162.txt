RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits applications and provides guidance for the 
Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 Enlisted to Medical Degree Preparatory Program (EMDP2).

2.  The EMDP2 is a 2-year undergraduate education program open to Sailors of 
all ratings who meet eligibility requirements in line with reference (a) and 
the EMDP2 website at https://medschool.usuhs.edu/academics/emdp2.  The EMDP2 
is a partnership between the Uniformed Services University of the Health 
Sciences (USUHS) and the Military Services to provide an opportunity for 
highly motivated, academically promising enlisted Service Members.  The EMDP2 
consists of intensive coursework, preparation, and mentoring to prepare 
students for application to medical school.
Upon completion of the program, successful students will be competitive for 
acceptance to medical schools in the United States.

3.  Selectees are assigned to the USUHS in Bethesda, MD, for two years.  
Individuals selected for the EMDP2 program will remain on Active Duty while 
completing coursework and will receive pay, allowances, benefits and 
privileges of their current paygrade.
Selectees will receive permanent change of station orders to USUHS for the 
entire length of the course.  USUHS will pay all school expenses (books, 
tuition, labs, etc.) for the entire length of the course.

4.  Deadline for submission of applications for FY-22 enrollment is
2359 Eastern Time on 30 September 2021.  Application packages must be 
received on or before the deadline date.  No additional documents or packages 
will be accepted after this date.  Application requirements are specified on 
the EMDP2 website at https://medschool.usuhs.edu/academics/emdp2.

5.  Strict adherence to package submission requirements will be a primary 
factor for selection.  Applicants must review their package in its entirety 
before submitting.  A minimum score of *Good* on the latest physical fitness 
assessment and qualifying Scholastic Assessment Test/American College Test 
scores are required.

6.  This NAVADMIN does not modify any previous guidance contained in 
reference (a), regarding selective reenlistment bonus.
