GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  TO ENSURE OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS NOW AND IN
THE FUTURE, NAVY MUST BOTH RETAIN THE TALENTS OF OUR SAILORS AND
ATTRACT AND COMPETE FOR THE HIGHEST QUALITY RECRUITS POSSIBLE.
CONSISTENT WITH OUR STRATEGY FOR OUR PEOPLE, RETAINING SAILORS WITH
CRITICAL SKILLS REMAINS A HIGH PRIORITY.  SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT
BONUS (SRB) RATES ARE CONTINUALLY REVIEWED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE
INCENTIVES ARE IN PLACE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN PROPER MANNING LEVELS
WITHIN ALL ENLISTED RATES.

AWARD LEVEL CEILING FOR TARGETED NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION (NEC)

REQUIREMENTS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES DETAILED IN NAVADMIN

ZONE OR PRECEDING A RATING INDICATES AN INCREASE TO THAT AWARD LEVEL
