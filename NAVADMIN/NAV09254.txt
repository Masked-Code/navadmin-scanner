SUBJ/LABOR DAY SAFETY MESSAGE//

RMKS/1. LABOR DAY ORIGINATED IN 1882 AS A "DAY OFF FOR THE WORKING MAN", AND 
BECAME A FEDERAL HOLIDAY IN 1894. THE ORIGINAL CELEBRATION OF LABOR DAY WAS 
OUTLINED IN THE FIRST PROPOSAL OF THE HOLIDAY--A STREET PARADE TO EXHIBIT TO 
THE PUBLIC "THE STRENGTH AND ESPRIT DE CORPS OF THE TRADE AND LABOR 
ORGANIZATIONS," FOLLOWED BY A FESTIVAL FOR THE WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE 
LONG LABOR DAY WEEKEND ALSO MARKS THE UNOFFICIAL END OF SUMMER. FOR SOME, THIS 
IS THE LAST CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN SUMMER OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS 
BEFORE THE WARM WEATHER DRAWS TO A CLOSE.

2. DURING THIS LONG HOLIDAY WEEKEND, I ASK THAT YOU BE SMART, SAFE, AND USE 
COMMON SENSE. THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PAST LABOR DAY MISHAPS OCCURRED DURING 
RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES. ALCOHOL AND OFF-DUTY RECREATION, BOTH ASHORE AND IN 
THE WATER, DON'T MIX. LAST YEAR, 29 OF 38 REPORTABLE MISHAPS ACROSS THE NAVY 
AND MARINE CORPS INVOLVED OFF-DUTY RECREATION SUCH AS SWIMMING, BOATING, AND 
SPORTS INJURIES.  DON'T TRY TO PACK ALL THOSE SUMMER ACTIVITIES INTO ONE 
WEEKEND. "PLAY TO LIVE AND LIVE TO PLAY."

3. MANY OF YOU PLAN TO TRAVEL, PLEASE REMEMBER THE NAVY HAS LOST ONE SAILOR TO 
A PRIVATE MOTOR VEHICLE MISHAP DURING EACH LABOR DAY HOLIDAY OVER THE PAST 6 
YEARS. MANY MORE HAVE BEEN INJURED, SOME CRITICALLY. IF YOU WILL BE TRAVELING 
AWAY FROM YOUR DUTY STATION BY CAR THIS WEEKEND, FILL OUT A TRAVEL RISK 
PLANNING SYSTEM (TRIPS) REPORT. YOU CAN FIND TRIPS AT WWW.NKO.NAVY.MIL. THE 
ONLINE ASSESSMENT WILL HELP YOU RECOGNIZE POSSIBLE RISK FACTORS IN YOUR TRIP 
AND DETERMINE WAYS TO MITIGATE THOSE RISKS.

4. AND FINALLY, DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE. IF YOUR WEEKEND ACTIVITIES INVOLVE 
ALCOHOL, HAVE A PLAN AND ARRANGE FOR A DESIGNATED DRIVER.
IF YOU HAVE BEEN DRINKING AND YOU NEED A RIDE HOME, DO NOT GET BEHIND THE 
WHEEL. CALL A FRIEND, RELATIVE, SHIPMATE OR TAXI TO GET YOU HOME SAFELY.

5. LET'S STOP THE TREND AND SHOOT FOR ZERO FATALITIES THIS LABOR DAY WEEKEND. 
I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING ALL OF YOU RETURN TO WORK ON TUESDAY MORNING. TAKE 
CARE OF EACH OTHER AND HAVE A SAFE, MEMORABLE, AND ENJOYABLE LABOR DAY 
WEEKEND.
