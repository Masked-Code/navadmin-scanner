RMKS/1.  Text messages qualifying as records under the Federal Records Act, 
regardless of the rank of the user who sent or received it, are to be 
retained according to the records management instructions prescribed by 
references (a) through (e).  This includes text messages of Navy Officials 
whose records are subject to capture and permanent retention by the National 
Archives and Records Administration. 
 
2.  Commands responsible for the issuance and destruction of government cell 
phones are required to save all text messages that meet the criteria of a 
Department of Navy (DON) record prior to re-issuance or destruction. 
 
3.  Navy personnel should not delete text messages that meet the criteria of 
a DON record.  If there is any question or doubt as to whether a message 
meets the criteria of a record, it should be saved. 
 
4.  In addition to their current responsibilities for preservation of 
qualified e-mail records, Fleet Cyber Command, in coordination with Systems 
Commands, will develop measures to ensure that qualified text messaging 
records are retained and only accessed by authorized U.S. Navy officials via 
official means, with justification such as a Freedom of Information Act 
request or Department of Justice inquiry.
