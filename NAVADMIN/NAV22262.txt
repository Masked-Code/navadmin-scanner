RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the implementation of Uniform National 
Discharge Standards (UNDS), Batch 2. 
 
2.  Background 
    a.  As of 25 October 2022, Navy vessels (United States Ship (USS), United 
States Naval Service (USNS), combatant craft, service craft, boats, and any 
other artificial contrivance) are required to comply with both existing UNDS 
Batch 1 standards and the standards for the following new eleven UNDS Batch 2 
discharges: 
        (1) Catapult Water Brake Tank and Post-Launch Retraction Exhaust 
        (2) Controllable Pitch Propeller Hydraulic Fluid 
        (3) Deck Runoff 
        (4) Firemain Systems 
        (5) Graywater 
        (6) Hull Coating Leachate 
        (7) Motor Gasoline and Compensating Discharge 
        (8) Sonar Dome Discharge 
        (9) Submarine Bilgewater 
        (10) Surface Vessel Bilgewater/Oil-Water Separator Effluent 
        (11) Underwater Ship Husbandry 
    b.  The UNDS Batch 1 and Batch 2 requirements can be found at 
https://www.esd.whs.mil/dd/, in reference (a).  Batch 1 UNDS requirements can 
also be found in reference (b). 
    c.  Existing Navy operations should already be in compliance with most of 
the Batch 2 discharge standards through the use of current systems and 
practices.  However, the new requirements will impose some additional 
reporting, information logging, and record-keeping responsibilities. 
    d.  Vessels that inadvertently make a discharge that does not comply with 
the UNDS standards must submit an UNDS non-compliance report within five 
calendar days.  Use the UNDS Non-Compliance Report format found in reference 
    (b), Appendix C-4 and provide an information copy the appropriate Navy 
Regional Environmental Coordinator (REC) where the vessel is homeported.  If 
the inadvertent UNDS discharge contained oil or fuel, then an Oil Spill 
Report will also be required. 
    e.  UNDS regulations are federal regulations, based on the federal Clean 
Water Act and in conformance with the Coastal Zone Management Act.  It is 
imperative that all Navy vessels are in full compliance with these 
requirements, as failure to comply could result in civil actions against the 
Navy. 
    f.  The UNDS requirements supersede any standards currently in place for 
a state or locality, and provide a single set of discharge standards 
nationwide.  Attempts by a state or locality to apply additional state or 
local regulations or permits to these discharges must be reported to the 
appropriate Navy REC. 
    g.  United States Coast Guard or state officials have the authority to 
enforce UNDS requirements.  If such officials request access to vessels or 
records, follow the procedures in reference (b), Chapter 35 and coordinate 
with the appropriate Navy REC. 
 
3.  Actions.  Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces (USFF) and Commander, Pacific 
Fleet(COMUSPACFLT) promulgate to type commanders and all ships and 
submarines. 
Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) promulgate to all installations 
with small boats and to all Navy RECs.  All other echelon 2 commands, and 
Office of Naval Research (ONR), promulgate to appropriate subordinate 
commands.
