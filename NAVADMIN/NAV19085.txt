B IS TITLE 37 U.S. CODE, PAY AND ALLOWANCES OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES.  REF C 
IS A CNO MEMORANDUM, ENLISTED SUPERVISOR RETENTION PAY POLICY MEMORANDUM.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces revised Enlisted Supervisor Retention Pay 
(ESRP) award levels and supersedes reference (a).  The ESRP program provides 
a retention incentive to senior Navy nuclear- trained enlisted Sailors with 
highly specialized skills.  The legal authority for ESRP shifted from section 
355 of reference (b) to section 331 of reference (b) effective 4 July 2016.  
Current ESRP requirements limit the program as follows:
    a.  The minimum reenlistment length is 3 years.
    b.  The maximum bonus amount for each year of additional obligated 
service (AOS) is limited to 30,000 dollars as stated in section 331 of 
reference (b).  The implication of this limit is that to earn a 100,000-
dollar bonus the minimum AOS required is 40 months.
    c.  All ESRP payments must be received prior to completion of 26 years of 
service (YOS).  The implication of this limit is that any ESRP installment 
that would be due after 26 YOS will be paid in the final installment prior to 
completion of 26 YOS.

2.  Award Multiples.  Increased award levels are effective immediately and 
decreased levels are effective 30 days after the release of this NAVADMIN.

3.  Eligibility.  Only Sailors assigned an active supervisor nuclear Navy 
enlisted classification (NEC) listed in paragraph 2 are eligible to reenlist 
for ESRP.  In addition, members must hold a current security clearance or in 
an open for new investigation status.  ESRP requests and anniversary payments 
for personnel with inactive NECs (N59X/N89X) will be held in abeyance pending 
final resolution.  Overall ESRP eligibility requirements are defined in 
reference (c).  In addition, to encourage career progression and provide 
incentive for continued superior at-sea service, the following supplementary 
eligibility requirements remain in place for each ESRP zone:
    a.  ESRP Zone 1.  In addition to the requirements of reference (c), be 
assigned an active nuclear supervisor NEC (see paragraph 2).
    b.  ESRP Zone 2.  In addition to the requirements of reference (c), be a 
frocked E-7 or in the paygrade of E-7, E- 8 or E-9 on the date of the ESRP 
Zone 2 reenlistment.
    c.  ESRP Zone 3.  In addition to the requirements of reference
(c):
        (1) be a frocked E-8 or in the paygrade of E-8 or E-9 on the date of 
the ESRP Zone 3 reenlistment and
        (2) have successfully previously served as, be currently serving as 
(on orders) or have been issued and accepted orders as a submarine 
engineering department master chief, nuclear aircraft carrier (CVN) major 
division leading chief petty officer, CVN reactor training division officer 
or CVN reactor department master chief.

4.  Application Process.  To ensure the approval message is released in a 
timely manner, ESRP reenlistment requests will be submitted 35 to 120 days in 
advance of the desired reenlistment date.  Exceptions to this policy will be 
approved by the ESRP program manager on an individual basis.
    a.  Officer Personnel Information System (OPINS) and Force Management 
System is programmed to process ESRP re-enlistment requests and employs the 
same process used to request and approve selective reenlistment bonus 
reenlistment requests.  Career counselors and personnel support detachments 
are familiar with this program and should use it as the primary method of 
ESRP request submission.  The ESRP request type is 3AA for Sailors on active 
duty and 3BB for broken service requests.
    b.  If OPINS is not available, the command can e-mail (scanned copy of 
request) or mail the request directly to the ESRP program manager utilizing 
the format found in reference (c).  If operational commitments limit the 
ability to submit ESRP applications via this manner, commands should submit 
the ESRP request via message to the immediate superior in charge, who can 
submit the OPINS request.
ESRP requests sent directly to the ESRP program manager by message or mail 
may result in a processing delay.
    c.  E-6 and below Zone 1 Sailors not already obligated beyond 14 YOS will 
require an approved career waypoints (C-WAY) reenlistment quota.  Sailors 
selected for advancement or frocked to chief petty officer do not require an 
approved C-WAY reenlistment quota.  C-WAY submission and quota approval can 
be pursued in parallel with the OPINS request for ESRP.
    d.  A Sailor must be pre-approved for an ESRP re-enlistment.
ESRP approval will not currently notify the Defense Joint Military Pay System 
(DJMS) of the intent of the Sailor to reenlist.  Until DJMS can be programmed 
to accept ESRP reenlistment payments, manual processing is required.  
Payments should post to the account of the Sailor within 14 days following 
the day the ESRP program manager receives notification of reenlistment.  
Initial payment will be authorized as soon as the contract execution is 
reflected in the enlisted master file (EMF).  In order to ensure prompt 
payment, new contracts must be posted to the EMF in a timely manner.
    e.  Personnel support detachments and commands should contact Nuclear 
Propulsion Programs Division (N133D) vice Defense Finance and Accounting 
System to resolve any payment issues.
    f.  A Sailor with an approved pre-certification, who does not reenlist on 
the date specified in the pre-certification message, must resubmit a request 
to revise the reenlistment date and ESRP award amount.

5.  Recoupment.  Receipt of any ESRP bonus is contingent upon the fulfillment 
of the specific conditions of eligibility, service and assignment of the ESRP 
program.  A Sailor who fails to fulfill these specified conditions during the 
period of service agreed upon, shall repay the U.S. Navy any unearned portion 
of the bonus.  Examples of situations requiring repayment are provided in 
reference (c).

6.  Service Record Entry.  An Administrative Remarks, NAVPERS 1070/613, entry 
acknowledging recoupment policy via Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System 
is required in the record of the Service Member prior to execution of an ESRP 
reenlistment (examples are provided in reference (c)).

7.  ESRP-eligible Sailors and their command career counselors should review 
reference (c), which provides further program details.
Reference (c) and other helpful information can be accessed via MyNavy Portal 
at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning,
