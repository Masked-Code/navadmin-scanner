RMKS/1.
1. THANKSGIVING WEEKEND MARKS THE TRADITIONAL START OF THE HOLIDAY 
SEASON. SAILORS, CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES, AND THEIR FAMILIES TAKE THIS TIME 
TO REST, RELAX, AND GIVE THANKS FOR THE MANY BLESSINGS WE ENJOY IN OUR 
COUNTRY.
2. MANY SAILORS WILL DRIVE AROUND THE COUNTRY TO BE WITH FAMILY OR 
FRIENDS. IT’S MY FERVENT HOPE THAT, OVER THE HOLIDAY, YOU WILL TAKE 
SPECIAL CARE AND WILL PLAN FOR YOUR SAFETY ON THE ROADS AND AT HOME.
3. PRIVATE MOTOR VEHICLE MISHAPS ARE A MAJOR CONCERN FOR OUR NAVY 
DURING THIS TIME OF YEAR BECAUSE OF INCREASED HOLIDAY TRAVEL AND THE 
ARRIVAL OF WINTER WEATHER IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. DESPITE OUR 
EFFORTS LAST YEAR, WE LOST FIVE SHIPMATES OVER THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY 
PERIOD. WE CAN DO BETTER, AND OUR GOAL IS TO BRING EVERYONE BACK ALIVE.
4. YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND CAN KEEP YOUR FAMILY OR OTHERS FROM 
EXPERIENCING THE UNWANTED SORROW THAT COMES WITH A MISHAP.
5. WE HAVE MANY AVAILABLE TOOLS TO ASSIST YOUR ON-DUTY AND OFF-DUTY 
SAFETY EFFORTS. ONE SUCH TOOL WITH GREAT PROMISE IS THE TRAVEL RISK 
PLANNING SYSTEM (TRIPS). I URGE EVERY SAILOR TRAVELING THIS HOLIDAY TO 
LOGON AND USE THIS SYSTEM TO COMPLETE A TRIP ASSESSMENT. IT WILL HELP 
YOU IDENTIFY HAZARDS, ASSESS RISK FACTORS, ESTABLISH CONTROLS TO 
MITIGATE RISK, AND PLAN FOR A SAFE TRIP. THE TRIPS SUPERVISOR?S MODULE 
WILL ALLOW LEADERS TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN REVIEWING TRIP PLANS, 
MITIGATING RISK, AND HELPING OUR PEOPLE BE SUCCESSFUL.
6. TRIPS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ON THE ROAD TO ELIMINATING 
PREVENTABLE MISHAPS. HELP ME, THE NAVY, AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOUR 
FAMILIES TAKE THAT FIRST STEP AND WORK TOWARD A MISHAP-FREE HOLIDAY 
PERIOD. IT CAN BE DONE, BUT EVERY SAILOR MUST DO THEIR PART TO MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE. IT WILL BE A WONDERFUL WAY TO SAY THANKS AT THIS FESTIVE 
TIME OF THE YEAR.
7. I WISH ALL OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES A SAFE AND JOYOUS HOLIDAY.
8. RELEASED BY ADMIRAL PATRICK M. WALSH, VICE CHIEF OF NAVAL 
OPERATIONS.//
