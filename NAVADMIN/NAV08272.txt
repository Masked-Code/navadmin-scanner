U.S. NAVY AND U.S. NAVY RESERVE.  REF C IS OPNAVINST 5351.2, ENLISTED 
NAVY LEADER DEVELOPMENT.  REF D IS OPNAVINST 3120.32C, STANDARD 
ORGANIZATION AND REGULATIONS OF THE U.S. NAVY.// RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN 
ESTABLISHES POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR NEW UNIT TRAINING REQUIREMENTS 
FOR PETTY OFFICER FIRST AND SECOND CLASS SELECTEES AS PART OF THEIR 
ENLISTED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT.  BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS OF THE PETTY 
OFFICER SELECTEE COURSE INTRODUCED IN 2006 AND THE CPO SELECTEE COURSE 
INTRODUCED IN 2007, THIS NEW TRAINING REPRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE 
IN HOW WE PROVIDE LEADERSHIP TRAINING TO OUR PO1 AND PO2 SELECTEES, 
AIMED AT IMPROVING OUR DECK PLATE LEADERS.  AS WITH THE PO AND CPO 
SELECTEE COURSES, COMMANDS WILL NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND 
RESPONSIBILITY TO DEVELOP THEIR ENLISTED LEADERSHIP.  USING CURRICULUM 
DIRECTLY AIMED AT THE NEWLY SELECTED PO1 AND PO2, THE NEW COURSES WILL 
PROVIDE MORE RELAVENT AND TIMELY LEADERSHIP TRAINING.  THIS NEW POLICY 
ALSO ELIMINATES A POTENTIAL IMPEDIMENT TO ADVANCEMENT BY REMOVING THE 
REQUIREMENT TO COMPLETE LEADERSHIP TRAINING IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE TO 
TAKE AN ADVANCEMENT EXAM.  THIS NOT ONLY REMOVES AN ADVANCEMENT BARRIER, 
BUT BY FOCUSING ONLY ON THOSE SELECTED FOR ADVANCEMENT, PROVIDES A 
SIGNIFICANT MANPOWER SAVINGS AS COMMANDS WILL NO LONGER BE REQUIRED TO 
SEND MOST OF THEIR SAILORS TAD FOR LEADERSHIP SCHOOLS.  AS HAS OCCURRED 
WITH THE OTHER SELECTEE COURSES, I EXPECT COMMAND MASTER CHIEFS AND THE 
CHIEFS' MESS TO STEP FORWARD AND EXECUTE THIS TRAINING TO PROVIDE OUR 
NEW SELECTEES WITH MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE RELEVANT LEADERSHIP TRAINING.
