RMKS/1.  This year's Army-Navy game is scheduled for Saturday,
12 December 2015 at Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia).
CBS Sports will televise the game and will once again accept "Go Navy, Beat 
Army" video spots from the Navy and Marine Corps team to be considered for 
broadcast during the game.  Please note that CBS generally only airs one 
spirit spot from each service, selected at their discretion.  Advanced notice 
of use by CBS is not possible.  Videos may be played on stadium jumbotron at 
the game, also at the organizer's discretion.
    a.  The Navy Office of Information and Defense Media Activity will push 
selected spots to a variety of media outlets, flagship web and broadcast 
platforms and social media sites prior to the game to help generate esprit de 
corps and as a way of highlighting our naval forces.
        (1) Requirements and best practices:
            (a) All spots must be submitted from a Navy or Marine Corps 
activity and release is embargoed until
7 December 2015.
            (b) Include the submitting command's name and location and 
include a "Go Navy, Beat Army" theme.
            (c) Avoid use of Navy or military jargon or acronyms.
            (d) Do not submit group/command/formation shout outs in which the 
group is shouting a message.
            (e) Experience has shown that submissions most likely to be 
successful in broadcast or social media sites are those with clean clear 
audio and exhibit enthusiasm, humor, creativity, and motivation.
            (f) Inclusion of Naval Academy graduates, unique locations, 
forward deployed locations and underway scenes are highly encouraged.
            (g) Spots cannot include copyrighted or sensitive material or 
music, make any official or implied endorsements or present commands or the 
Navy in a negative light.
            (h) Spots should be broadcast quality in one of the following 
File formats:
                1.  Files should be at least 8 mb/s but no more than 100 mb/s 
and in mxf, mpeg, wmv, mp4, mov or avi file formats.
M4v, flv and swf files are not accepted.
                2.  Tapes are not accepted.  Efforts should focus on 
electronic transmission.
                3.  All submissions must be in high definition
(1920x1080 or 1280x720).
            (i) If intended for CBS, spots must be no more than
30 seconds in length, however spots intended for social media or other web-
only outlets shall not be longer than two minutes.
            (j) Use high quality Navy branding graphics available for use at:  
http://extensis.cnrc.navy.mil/graphics.htm and enter the branding products 
page.
            (k) Submit only ready-to-air spots.  Neither CBS nor the Navy 
Office of Information will edit submissions.
            (l) Frame shots according to rules of good composition (avoid 
talking heads with no bodies) and avoid distracting backgrounds and 
inadvertent commercial product placement.
            (m) Good audio quality and sharp focus are paramount.
Poor audio quality is a primary reason for rejection.  Check for over 
modulated audio, weak audio, unclear voices or background noise prior to 
submitting.

2.  Support from Navy Public Affairs Support Elements, Defense Media Activity 
detachments or broadcast detachments are permissible on a not-to-interfere 
with operational requirements basis.

3.  Commands are to send original, broadcast quality footage by electronic 
means, express shipment or fastest method available to the Navy Office of 
Information (OI-2).  Submissions must be received before 30 November 2015.  
Late submissions are not accepted.  Please consider shipping times for 
overseas and deployed units.  Send to:

4.  Request widest possible dissemination of this message.  This is an 
excellent means of highlighting Navy teamwork and the spirit of our Sailors 
and Marines forward deployed around the world.  Go Navy, beat Army.
