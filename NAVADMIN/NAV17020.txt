RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN serves to notify all Navy personnel eligible to opt-in 
to the Blended Retirement System (BRS) that the Blended Retirement System 
Opt-In Course is now available.  Completion of this training is mandatory for 
all opt-in eligible personnel.

2.  On 1 January 2018, in order to provide a more modern and flexible 
retirement system for its members, the military services will transition to 
the BRS as directed in reference (a).  As indicated in references (b) and 
(c), in an effort to facilitate a smooth transition to BRS, training will be 
offered to all Service Members.  Opt-in criteria is clearly delineated in 
reference (c) and, in general, it applies to all active component members who 
have less than 12 years of service and reserve component members who have 
fewer than 4,320 retirement points on 31 December 2017.

3.  BRS opt-in training supports Service Members in making their BRS opt-in 
decision during calendar year 2018.  Whether or not Service Members choose to 
opt-in, all Service Members who are opt-in eligible MUST complete the Blended 
Retirement System Opt-In Course no later than 31 December 2017.  The course 
is available now on Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) at http://jko.jten.mil/ 
(course #: J3OP-US1332) and will soon be available on Navy e-Learning.
Additionally, access to the course will soon be available in the financial 
literacy mobile application, located in the Sea Warrior Collections in the 
Application Store for iOS products, and Google Play Store for Android 
products.  The course and an online BRS calculator, which will be released by 
March 2017, are designed to equip Navy personnel with the tools necessary to 
make an educated decision on which retirement system is right for them.  
Command Financial Specialists, Personal Financial Managers at local Fleet and 
Family Support Centers, and Military OneSource Personal Financial Counselors 
are available to provide unit level training and individual counseling.

4.  All Navy commands must ensure that opt-in eligible Service Members 
complete the Blended Retirement System Opt-In Course and that the training 
completion is documented in the Fleet Management and Planning System 
(FLTMPS).  Additionally, in order to facilitate BRS eligibility notification, 
Command Pay and Personnel Administrators and Navy Reserve Activity Command 
Administrators must ensure all command members have updated e-mail addresses 
in Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System as announced in reference (d). 
In line with reference (b), members that are not eligible to opt-in are still 
required to complete BRS training, but may choose between the opt-in course 
and the BRS Leaders Course.

5.  If Navy personnel are unable to complete the training via JKO or Navy e-
learning due to connectivity issues or if commands prefer training in a group 
setting, digital video devices (DVD) are available for order through the 
Defense Imagery Management Operations Center.  These DVDs are provided at no 
cost to the requesting command and provide a training platform that allows 
commands to train in a classroom setting.  If this option is exercised, 
commands must ensure that training is documented in FLTMPS via a Learning 
Event Completion Form.

6.  The importance of the decision to enroll in BRS or remain in the current 
retirement system cannot be overstated.  Not only is this decision 
irrevocable, but it is likely the most important financial decision in the 
naval career of an opt-in eligible Service Member. If you are opt-in eligible 
it is in your best interest to ensure that the training is complete and that 
you are making the most informed financial decision possible.

7.  Released by Vice Admiral R. P. Burke, N1.//
