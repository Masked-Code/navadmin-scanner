SUBJ/IMPLEMENTATION OF LIMITED DUTY SAILOR AND MARINE READINESS TRACKER 
SYSTEM//

RMKS/1.  Limited duty (LIMDU) Sailor and Marine readiness tracker system 
(SMART) is replacing the Medical Evaluation Board System as the tracking 
system for Temporary Limited Duty and Physical Evaluation Board referrals.  
All commands are required to gain access.  Utilize this NAVADMIN to learn how 
and when to gain access.

2.  Deployability coordinators must complete the online LIMDU SMART computer 
based training (CBT) course for deployability coordinators prior to obtaining 
access to the LIMDU SMART system.  The course may be accessed at 
https://edqtest.med.navy.mil/cbts/.

3.  After completion of the CBT, deployability coordinators gain access to 
LIMDU SMART by contacting their Patient Administration Office at their 
commands servicing Medical Treatment Facility (MTF).  With the exception of 
U.S. European Command (EUCOM) and U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) MTFs, all 
MTFs will have completed the transition to LIMDU SMART by 30 September 2016, 
and commands may begin requesting access.  Transition of EUCOM and AFRICOM 
MTFs will be completed during FY-17, and commands may gain access as soon as 
the transition is complete.  In addition to granting access to LIMDU SMART, 
servicing MTFs can provide additional training.
