SUBJ/NAVY ETHOS// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS//1.  IN THE 2007-2008 CNO GUIDANCE, I DIRECTED THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF A NAVY ETHOS THAT WOULD REFLECT THE VALUES INTEGRAL TO 
MISSION ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR ACTIVE AND RESERVE SAILORS AND NAVY 
CIVILIANS, NO MATTER THE ASSIGNED UNIT, COMMAND, OR COMMUNITY.
2.  AFTER GATHERING INPUT ACROSS THE NAVY FOR THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, 
THE NAVY ETHOS HAS BEEN APPROVED.  THE FINAL PRODUCT IS THE RESULT OF 
COMMENTS FROM THOUSANDS OF ACTIVE AND RESERVE SAILORS AND NAVY 
CIVILIANS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE ON THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND 
VALUES THE NAVY EMPLOYS DAILY TO WIN WARS AND BUILD AND MAINTAIN 
SECURITY AND STABILITY.
3.  AN ETHOS IDENTIFIES DISTINGUISHING CHARACTER, CULTURE, OR BELIEFS 
OF A GROUP OR INSTITUTION.  NAVY ETHOS IS DESIGNED TO COMMUNICATE A SET 
OF BELIEFS APPROPRIATE AND IMPORTANT TO THE MORE THAN 400,000 MILITARY 
AND 180,000 CIVILIAN PERSONNEL WHO SHARE A COMMON BOND OF SERVICE IN 
THE NAVY, REGARDLESS OF BACKGROUND, PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, OR POSITION.
4.  THE NAVY ETHOS:
-- WE ARE THE UNITED STATES NAVY, OUR NATION'S SEA POWER - READY 
GUARDIANS OF PEACE, VICTORIOUS IN WAR.
-- WE ARE PROFESSIONAL SAILORS AND CIVILIANS - A DIVERSE AND AGILE 
FORCE EXEMPLIFYING THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF SERVICE TO OUR NATION, AT 
HOME AND ABROAD, AT SEA AND ASHORE.
-- INTEGRITY IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR CONDUCT; RESPECT FOR OTHERS IS 
FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR CHARACTER; DECISIVE LEADERSHIP IS CRUCIAL TO OUR 
SUCCESS.
-- WE ARE A TEAM, DISCIPLINED AND WELL-PREPARED, COMMITTED TO MISSION 
ACCOMPLISHMENT.  WE DO NOT WAVER IN OUR DEDICATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
TO OUR SHIPMATES AND FAMILIES.
-- WE ARE PATRIOTS, FORGED BY THE NAVY'S CORE VALUES OF HONOR, COURAGE 
AND COMMITMENT.  IN TIMES OF WAR AND PEACE, OUR ACTIONS REFLECT OUR 
PROUD HERITAGE AND TRADITION. 
-- WE DEFEND OUR NATION AND PREVAIL IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY WITH 
STRENGTH, DETERMINATION, AND DIGNITY.
-- WE ARE THE UNITED STATES NAVY.
