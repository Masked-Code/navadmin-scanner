REF/A/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON DC/021659ZOCT2007// AMPN/REF A IS NAVADMIN 
251/07 FY-08 SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS MESSAGE// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN DESCRIBES THE IMPACT THE CURRENT FEDERAL BUDGET 
CONTINUING RESOLUTION (CR) HAS ON CERTAIN SRB PAYMENTS. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS OPERATING UNDER A CR PENDING ENACTMENT OF 
THE FY-08 DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT.  THE CURRENT CR GRANTS AUTHORITY 
FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO DISBURSE FUNDS THROUGH
16 NOVEMBER 2007, AND LIMITS FUNDS AVAILABLE TO FY-07 EXPENDITURES 
THROUGH THAT DATE.  AS A RESULT, IT IS NECESSARY TO PRIORITIZE SRB 
REQUESTS TO ENSURE TIME AND SITUATION-CRITICAL REQUESTS ARE 
APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED. 
2.  CURRENT FY-08 SRB REQUESTS WILL BE PRIORITIZED AS FOLLOWS UNTIL THE 
DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT HAS BEEN APPROVED, OR THE DEPARTMENT OF 
DEFENSE IS EXTENDED UNDER ANOTHER CR:
    A.  SAILOR?S EAOS IS ON OR BEFORE THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE 
CURRENT CR (REACHED 48-MONTH MAXIMUM EXTENSION TIME).
    B.  SAILOR WILL PASS THROUGH AN SRB ZONE OF ELIGIBILITY ON OR 
BEFORE THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE CURRENT CR.
    C.  SAILOR IS UNDER PCS ORDERS REQUIRING OBLISERV, AND ORDERS MUST 
BE EXECUTED PRIOR TO OR ON THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE CURRENT CR.
    D.  SAILOR REQUESTS TO REENLIST AND HAS AN EAOS ON OR BEFORE THE 
EXPIRATION DATE OF THE CURRENT CR AND IS IN A TAX FREE ZONE WHERE 
REENLISTING AFTER SUCH DATE WOULD PLACE THE SAILOR AT A MONETARY 
DISADVANTAGE.  SAILORS REQUESTING TO REENLIST AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF 
THE CURRENT CR WILL BE COVERED BY AN EXTENDED CR OR APPROVED DEFENSE 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT.
    E.  SAILOR HAS AN INOPERATIVE EXTENSION WITH A HARD EAOS BEFORE OR 
ON THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE CURRENT CR.
    F.  SAILORS REQUESTING REENLISTMENT AND NOT FALLING IN CATEGORIES A 
THROUGH E.
3.  ADDITIONALLY, PRIORITY WILL BE GRANTED AND REQUEST REVIEWED FOR 
SAILORS SERVING IN DIRECT SUPPORT OF GWOT ASSIGNMENTS WITHIN EACH 
PRIORITIZED CATEGORY A THROUGH F.
4.  THOSE SAILORS WHOSE FY-08 REENLISTMENT REQUEST CANNOT BE SUPPORTED 
WITHIN THE LIMITS OF FUNDING AT THE TIME OF RECEIPT WILL BE NOTIFIED BY 
PERS-811 TO RESUBMIT REQUEST FOR PRECERTIFICATION OF REENLISTMENT WITH 
AN ALTERNATIVE REENLISTMENT DATE NO EARLIER THAN THE EXPIRATION DATE OF 
THE CURRENT CR.  ALTERNATE DATE SHOULD BE NOTED IN THE COMMENTS SECTION 
OF THE REQUEST FOR PRECERTIFICATION.
5.  IF THE DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT IS APPROVED BY THE EXPIRATION 
DATE OF THE CURRENT CR, OR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS EXTENDED UNDER 
ANOTHER CR, RESUBMITTED PRECERTIFICATIONS WILL BE PROCESSED FOR THE 
ORIGINALLY REQUESTED REENLISTMENT DATE.  IF ADDITIONAL FY-08 FUNDS ARE 
NOT APPROVED, ELIGIBLE PRECERTIFICATIONS WILL BE PROCESSED FOR THE 
REQUESTED REENLISTMENT DATE BEYOND THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE CURRENT 
CR. 
6.  SRB CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE NAVY?S MOST IMPRESSIVE RETENTION 
SUCCESS STORIES.  WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO TAKING CARE OF OUR SAILORS AND 
HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD WITH CONGRESS TO ENSURE CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THE 
SRB PROGRAM.  I NEED YOUR HELP IN ENSURING WE MAKE THE MOST EFFICIENT 
USE OF OUR SRB RESOURCES WHILE ENCOURAGING OUR SAILORS TO REENLIST AND 
CONTINUE THEIR COMMITMENT OF SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. 
7.  THE FIRST POINT OF CONTACT FOR A SAILOR WITH QUESTIONS REGARDING 
THE SRB PROGRAM IS THEIR COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR (CCC).  FOR TECHNICAL 
QUESTIONS OR CLARIFICATIONS, CCC'S ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT 
COMNAVPERSCOM, PERS-811F, AT (901) 874-2526/DSN 882, FAX
(901) 874-2623/DSN 882, OR E-MAIL ETC(SW/AW) SCOTT MCCANN AT
