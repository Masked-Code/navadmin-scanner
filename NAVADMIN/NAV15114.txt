SUBJ/MILITARY SPOUSE APPRECIATION DAY 2015//

MSGID/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/N00/MAY//

RMKS/1.  On May 8th, Military Spouse Appreciation Day, we recognize military 
Spouses and their tremendous contributions to our Sailors, our Families, and 
our Navy communities. While our Service members are unique in that they are 
all volunteers, the Spouses of those Sailors are special in their own right - 
serving as an integral part of our Navy team, they share in the commitment to 
support and defend our Nation.

2.  Today's military Spouses stand by and embrace our Sailors through their 
service.  More than just supporters, they are professionals themselves, 
frequently sole home-front caretakers, and pillars of their communities.  
Many play the vital role of Ombudsman, actively connecting Spouses, Families, 
and commands.

3.  My deepest gratitude goes out to our Spouses.  We salute them for keeping 
Navy's most valuable resource, our people, supported and sustained.  For your 
dedication and service, we thank you.

4.  Released by the Chief of Naval Operations.//
