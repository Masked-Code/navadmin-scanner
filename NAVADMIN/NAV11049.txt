SUBJ/EFFECT OF FY-11 CONTINUING RESOLUTION (CR) ON PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION 
ORDERS (PCS)//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES AN UPDATE ON PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION (PCS) 
EXECUTION UNDER THE FY-11 CONTINUING RESOLUTION (CR).  DUE TO THE ALLOCATION 
OF RESOURCES UNDER A CR, NPC HAS RECEIVED LESS FUNDING THAN REQUIRED BY OUR 
OPERATIONS PLAN AND IS CURRENTLY RELEASING PRIORITY ORDERS FOR MEMBERS WITH 
DETACHMENT DATES BETWEEN FEBRUARY AND MAY 2011.  SAILORS DETACHING IN THE NEXT 
FEW MONTHS WHO HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED ORDERS WILL LIKELY HAVE LESS THAN TWO 
MONTHS LEAD TIME WHEN THEIR ORDERS ARE RELEASED.

2.  WORKING IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH ENTERPRISE MANPOWER AUTHORITIES, PERS-4 
WILL USE A PRIORITIZATION STRATEGY TO MINIMIZE IMPACTS TO FLEET READINESS, 
CAREER TIMING, AND FAMILIES.  EMPHASIS REMAINS ON GLOBAL SUPPORT ASSIGNMENT 
ROTATIONS, CAREER MILESTONE BILLETS, CRITICAL READINESS FILLS, MINIMIZING GAPS 
AT SEA FOR DEPLOYED UNITS AND THOSE WORKING UP TO DEPLOY, AND MOVING NEW 
ACCESSIONS THROUGH TRAINING PIPELINES.

3.  WE FULLY REALIZES THE IMPACT OF THIS UNCERTAINTY ON OUR FAMILIES.  WE 
REMAIN COMMITTED TO PROVIDING SAILORS WITH AS MUCH INFORMATION AND LEAD TIME 
AS POSSIBLE.  OUR CURRENT FISCAL CHALLENGES WILL RESULT IN COMPRESSED PCS 
TIMELINES FOR MOST SAILORS WITH PROJECTED ROTATION DATES DURING SUMMER AND 
FALL 2011.  

4.  WHILE WE ENCOURAGE ALL SAILORS WITH PROJECTED ROTATION DATES DURING THIS 
FISCAL YEAR TO CONTACT THEIR DETAILERS, THERE MAY BE A DELAY IN DETAILER 
RESPONSES AS WE WORK THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ISSUES.  PLEASE FIRST REFER TO THE PCS 
'FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS' ON THE NPC WEBSITE HTTP://WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL OR 
CONTACT THE NPC CALL CENTER AT 1-866-U-ASK-NPC (1-866-827-5672).
