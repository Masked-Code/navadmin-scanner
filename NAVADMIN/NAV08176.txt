RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN INTRODUCES REF A AS THE E7-E9 EVALUATION AND 
COUNSELING RECORD (CHIEFEVAL), REPLACING THE CURRENT FITREP, REF B, FOR 
CHIEF PETTY OFFICERS (E7-E9). THE CHIEFEVAL INCORPORATES CHIEF PETTY 
OFFICER EXPECTATIONS AS PERFORMANCE TRAITS, WHICH COMPLETES ALIGNMENT 
OF CHIEF PETTY OFFICER EXPECTATIONS, SELECTION GUIDANCE, AND 
EVALUATIONS.
2. FUNCTIONALLY, THE CHIEFEVAL AND THE CURRENT FITREP DIFFER ONLY IN 
BLOCKS 5 AND 33 THROUGH 39.  ALL FITREP WRITING GUIDANCE IN REF C 
APPLIES DIRECTLY TO THE CHIEFEVAL, WITH THE FOLLOWING AMPLIFYING 
INSTRUCTIONS:
    A.  FITREP PERFORMANCE TRAIT COMMAND OR ORGANIZATIONAL 
CLIMATE/EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IS EVALUATED IN THE CHARACTER TRAIT OF THE 
CHIEFEVAL.  IT IS VITAL TO OUR SUCCESS THAT CHIEF PETTY OFFICERS 
SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATE DIVERSITY INTO THE FABRIC OF THEIR CHARACTER AND 
INTO THE COMMAND'S EVERY DAY ACTIVITIES.  
A GRADE OF 2.0 IN CHARACTER MUST BE SPECIFICALLY SUBSTANTIATED IN BLOCK 
41.  IF A 2.0 GRADE IN CHARACTER IS ASSIGNED, THE REPORT IS CONSIDERED 
ADVERSE AND THE CHIEF PETTY OFFICER (E7-E9) IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR 
ADVANCEMENT, OR ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A RECOMMENDATION OF PROMOTABLE.
    B.  EVALUATION OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CNO'S RETENTION AND 
ATTRITION GOALS IS SPREAD ACROSS DECKPLATE LEADERSHIP, PROFESSIONALISM, 
LOYALTY AND CHARACTER.
    C.  FITREP PERFORMANCE TRAIT MILITARY BEARING IS EVALUATED IN THE 
CHIEFEVAL AS A COMPONENT OF THE PROFESSIONALISM TRAIT.  
THIS WILL INCLUDE SPECIFIC PHYSICAL FITNESS ASSESSMENT INFORMATION PER 
REF D GUIDELINES.
    D.  THE CRITERIA FOR AN ADVERSE CHIEFEVAL REMAINS THE SAME AS THE 
FITREP EXCEPT AS OUTLINED IN PARA 2.A ABOVE.
