2.  THE LATERAL TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION BOARD IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE.
EACH RECORD PRESENTED TO THE BOARD IS CAREFULLY REVIEWED AND THE BEST 
AND MOST QUALIFIED ARE CHOSEN.

3.  QUOTA CONSTRAINTS FOR JUNIOR YEAR GROUPS (04 THROUGH 08) WERE 
ESPECIALLY TIGHT THUS THE DEMAND SIGNAL FAR EXCEEDED THE SUPPLY POOL.
MANY QUALITY APPLICANTS WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE BOARD, BUT COULD NOT BE 
SELECTED DUE TO QUOTA CONSTRAINTS OF EITHER OUTGOING COMMUNITY OR 
GAINING COMMUNITY.  THEREFORE, NOT BEING SELECTED FOR THIS BOARD IS NOT 
A REASON TO FEEL THAT YOU HAVE NO FUTURE CHANCE.  YOU SHOULD APPLY 
AGAIN (AND AGAIN AS REQUIRED), ALL THE WHILE SUSTAINING SUPERIOR 
PERFORMANCE AND BOLSTERING YOUR RECORD FOR YOUR DESIRED COMMUNITY.  
WHAT MAKES YOUR RECORD STANDOUT IS MOTIVATION TOWARDS YOUR GAINING 
COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS CONTINUED PROMOTABILITY.

4.  AS ALWAYS, COMPETITION FOR REDESIGNATION WAS KEEN AND EVERY 
COMMUNITY HAD A POOL OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES.  ELIGIBLE OFFICERS 
NOT INITIALLY SELECTED, AND WHO DID NOT SPECIFICALLY REQUEST NOT TO BE 
REVIEWED BY COMMUNITIES OTHER THAN THEIR FIRST OR SECOND CHOICE, WERE 
SUBSEQUENTLY REVIEWED BY ALL OTHER COMMUNITIES.  THOSE OFFICERS 
TENTATIVELY SELECTED FOR COMMUNITIES NOT INITIALLY REQUESTED WILL BE 
NOTIFIED VIA OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE AND OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
REDESIGNATE.

5.  THE PROCESS, WHILE NEVER PERFECT, IS FAIR AND THOROUGH.  BOARD 
MEMBERS ARE FOCUSED ON THEIR TASK: PICKING THE RIGHT CANDIDATE WHO IS 
FULLY AND BEST QUALIFIED FROM THE AVAILABLE APPLICANTS.  EACH RECORD 
RECEIVES A DETAILED SCRUB AND THERE IS THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE 
DISCUSSIONS ON EACH APPLICANT.

6.  THIS MSG IS NOT AUTHORITY TO DELIVER CHANGE OF DESIGNATOR LETTERS 
TO THE SELECTEE.
    A.  OFFICERS WHO ARE PROMOTION SELECTEES SHOULD CONTACT THEIR 
CURRENT DETAILER TO DISCUSS REDESIGNATION TIMING.  COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-
802), UPON NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) THAT THE SELECTEE HAS 
BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO THEIR NEW COMMUNITY, WILL FORWARD A 
REDESIGNATION LETTER TO THE SELECTEE OR APPOINTMENT ACCEPTANCE AND OATH 
OF OFFICE (NAVPERS 1000/4), AS APPLICABLE.
    B.  OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT PROMOTION SELECTEES AND WHO ARE NOT UNDER 
ORDERS CAN EXPECT ASSIGNMENT TO A NEW BILLET APPROPRIATE TO THEIR NEW 
DESIGNATION WHEN NOTIFIED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4).
    C.  IF A MEMBER IS CURRENTLY UNDER ORDERS AND TRANSFERS PRIOR TO 
NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4), MEMBER MUST EXECUTE ORDERS 
UNDER CURRENT DESIGNATOR AND MUST COMPLETE 12 MONTHS AT THE NEW 
ASSIGNMENT, UNLESS A SHORTER TOUR IS PRESCRIBED (TOURS IN EXCESS OF ONE 
YEAR WILL BE WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE GAINING COMMUNITY), PRIOR TO 
REDESIGNATION.

7.  THE FOLLOWING ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE ABOVE:
    A.  SURFACE WARFARE (11XX) OFFICERS WHO ARE UNDER ORDERS TO 
DEPARTMENT HEAD SCHOOL MAY NOT LATERALLY TRANSFER UNTIL COMPLETION OF 
INITIAL DEPARTMENT HEAD TOUR.
    B.  AVIATION OFFICERS (131X AND 132X) SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED TO 
LATERAL TRANSFER UNTIL COMPLETION OF ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE OBLIGATION, 
EXPIRATION OF AVIATION CAREER CONTINUATION PAY CONTRACT, OR PLANNED 
ROTATION DATE, WHICHEVER IS LATER.
    C.  APPLICANTS FOR 1510 WHO ARE PRESENTLY DESIGNATED 131X OR 132X 
AND A SECOND SEA TOUR OR AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD TOUR HAS NOT BEEN 
COMPLETED, ASSIGNMENT TO 1510 BILLETS MAY BE DELAYED UNTIL THE 
COMPLETION OF APPLICABLE SECOND SEA AND/OR AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD 
TOUR, AS DETERMINED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-43).

8.  COMMANDING OFFICER WILL:
    A.  ENSURE OFFICERS SELECTED FOR PROMOTION WITHIN THEIR CURRENT 
COMMUNITY DO NOT ACCEPT REDESIGNATION BEFORE THEIR PROMOTION DATE.
    B.  NOTIFY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-803) WITHIN 30 DAYS OF RELEASE OF 
THIS MESSAGE OF SELECTEES WHO DO NOT DESIRE TO ACCEPT 
TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION.

9.  THE NEXT TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION BOARD WILL BE HELD IN NOVEMBER 
2010.
APPLICATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 17 SEPTEMBER 2010.  PREVIOUS 
APPLICATIONS ARE NOT RETAINED, NON-SELECTEES FROM PREVIOUS BOARDS MUST 
SUBMIT A NEW APPLICATION FOR CONSIDERATION.  A FUTURE NAVADMIN WILL 
STIPULATE ALL OF THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION 
PROCEDURES IAW REF A THRU D.
