MSGID/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/N1/SEP//
REF/A/DOC/COMNAVPERSCOM/1JUL12//
AMPN/REF A IS MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1160-120, HIGH YEAR TENURE.//

RMKS/1.  The Navy*s High Year Tenure (HYT) policy is an effective force 
management tool that is used to properly size and shape the active and 
reserve components.  Changes have been made to this policy to apply HYT gates 
to Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) members and place limits on active status 
pool (ASP) members not serving in volunteer training units (VTU).  In 
addition, the HYT policy has been revised to clarify eligibility criteria and 
reflect current administrative processes for waiver requests.  These policy 
changes will help better manage our active and reserve forces.

2.  Revisions to HYT will:
    a.  Add a new Reserve status chart to clarify service categories
    and include Reserve-specific language throughout the document.
    b.  Make Selected Reserve length of service (LOS) HYT limits
    apply to the IRR and establish a ceiling for ASP Sailors not serving in 
the VTU.
    c.  Update the HYT gates chart for active component (AC) and full time 
support (FTS), as well as add a HYT gates chart for Ready Reserve and ASP 
personnel.
    d.  Grandfather current E-4 VTU personnel to obtain 20 Total Years
Qualifying Service (TYQS) contingent upon successive qualifying years.
    e.  Provide a waiver process for E5/E6 Reserve members in the VTU to 
reenlist one time upon reaching HYT limitations, not to exceed 20 TYQS.
    f.  Establish automatic HYT waivers for E7 to E9 Ready Reserve members, 
to serve in the VTU until 30 years LOS or 30 TYQS, whichever occurs first.
    g.  Provide guidance for E9 AC/FTS/Ready Reserve personnel who 
participate in command master chief/force master chief/fleet master chief 
programs and/or who serve in a command senior enlisted leader role to exceed 
30 years of service when supporting flag or general officer support 
assignments.
    h.  Update HYT waiver eligibility section to include Ready Reserve 
requests and add a new HYT waiver ineligibility section to clarify qualifying 
and non-qualifying requests.
    i.  Expand the special consideration section regarding HYT to include
limited duty status (LIMDU), Ready Reserve medical determinations and Ready 
Reserve members selected for officer appointments.

3.  Command and Unit Career Counselors are responsible for ensuring that all 
members affected by these changes receive counseling at the earliest 
opportunity.  Reserve Enlisted Personnel (PERS-913) is responsible for 
ensuring that all ASP and Standby Reserve-Active members are notified of 
these provisions.

4.  Points of contacts:
    a.  Members should contact the appropriate office identified under
Roles and Responsibilities in reference (a).
    b.  General HYT policy related questions may be sent to OPNAV
    N132 via e-mail at NXAG_N132C4A(at)navy.mil.

5.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
wichever occurs first.
