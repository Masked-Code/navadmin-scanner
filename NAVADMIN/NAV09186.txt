NARR/ REF A IS NAVADMIN 190/08, UNIFORM UPDATE.  
REF B IS U.S. NAVY UNIFORM REGS.// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES CHANGES TO THE SCHEDULED FLEET 
AVAILABILITY OF THE E1-E6 SERVICE UNIFORM, AVAILABILITY OF THE IMPROVED 
PHYSICAL FITNESS UNIFORM (PTU) SHIRT AND PROCEDURES FOR ADDRESSING NAVY 
WORKING UNIFORM (NWU) COMPONENT ISSUES RELATED TO BUTTONS AND BOOTS.  
2.  THE SERVICE UNIFORM FLEET AVAILABILITY SCHEDULE AS OUTLINED IN REF 
A IS REVISED AS A RESULT OF ROBUST COMPONENT PRODUCTION EFFORTS AND 
HIGH POPULARITY THROUGHOUT THE FLEET.  COMMENCING 1 SEPTEMBER 2009, 
SERVICE UNIFORM COMPONENTS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE AND ORDERING 
AT NAVY EXCHANGE UNIFORM CENTERS LOCATED AT NAVY EXCHANGE REGION 
SOUTHEAST, NORTHEAST, EUROPE, JAPAN AND GUAM.  
3.  THE NEW "GENERATION 2" PTU-SHIRTS WILL BEGIN ARRIVING IN NAVY 
EXCHANGES AND WILL BE AVAILABLE ON LINE OR THROUGH THE UNIFORM SUPPORT 
CALL CENTER ON 30 JUNE.  THIS NEW T-SHIRT IS 100 PERCENT POLYESTER, 
HEAVIER WEIGHT, MOISTURE WICKING, ANTIMICROBIAL, WITH A HIGHER THREAD 
COUNT.  OPACITY AND LENGTH IMPROVEMENTS EXPRESSED BY THE FLEET HAVE 
BEEN INCORPORATED.  GEN 1 SHIRTS WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE 
UNTIL STOCKS ARE DEPLETED.
4.   NWU COMPONENT QUALITY CONCERNS REPORTED BY LIMITED MEMBERS OF
THE FLEET INCLUDE LOOSE BUTTONS AND BOOT DISCOMFORT.  BOTH ISSUES HAVE 
BEEN THOROUGHLY REVIEWED BY THE NAVY CLOTHING AND TEXTILE RESEARCH 
FACILITY AND THE RESPECTIVE MANUFACTURERS.  LIMITED EARLY PRODUCTION 
RUNS OF SHIRTS AND TROUSERS WERE FOUND TO HAVE INSUFFICIENT BUTTON 
STITCHING.  THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN CORRECTED BY THE MANUFACTURERS.  
BUTTON REPLACEMENT IS AVAILABLE AT NAVY EXCHANGE UNIFORM SHOPS AT NO 
COST.  NAVY EXCHANGE POC LISTED BELOW WILL PROVIDE REPLACEMENT BUTTONS 
TO DEPLOYED COMMANDS UPON REQUEST.  BOOT DISCOMFORT HAS BEEN FOUND TO 
BE LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO WEARING INCORRECTLY SIZED BOOTS.  
MANUFACTURERS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING FIT CLINICS AT ROLLOUT LOCATIONS TO 
HELP ENSURE CORRECT CHOICE OF BOOT SIZE AND PROPER FIT.  SAILORS ARE 
ENCOURAGED TO TRY BOOTS ON PRIOR TO PURCHASE.  SAILORS SUSPECTING THEY 
HAVE DEFECTIVE OR IMPROPERLY FITTED BOOTS CAN RETURN SAME TO THEIR 
CLOSEST NAVY EXCHANGE UNIFORM SHOP FOR REPLACEMENT.
