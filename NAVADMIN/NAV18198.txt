RMKS/1.  Pursuant to references (a) and (b) this NAVADMIN announces the 
Junior Permanent Military Professor (JPMP) Board for November 2018.  The JPMP 
Program seeks active-duty, unrestricted line or Information Warfare Community 
officers, selected for or serving in the permanent grade of lieutenant 
commander (LCDR) (O-4), preferably with teaching experience, to join the 
faculty at the United States Naval Academy (USNA).  Warfare-qualified 120X, 
144X, 146X, 15XX, 1710, and 510X applicants may also be considered in 
addition to the designators listed in reference (a).  Selection for 
assignment to the JPMP program is made by an institutional screening panel.

2.  In addition to the eligibility requirements specified in reference (a), 
the following apply:
    a.  Officers must be available to report to USNA no later than 
31 July 2019.
    b.  Paygrade requirements may not be waived.  Officers who failed to 
select to commander (O-5) two or more times are not eligible to apply.  
Officers already selected to O-5 are not eligible.  Officers selected to O-5 
during the FY-20 promotion cycle will no longer be eligible.

3.  Officers must have a relevant masters degree to serve as JPMPs.
For those applicants who do not have a relevant masters degree at the time of

Postgraduate School for relevant science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics disciplines or to a USNA-approved civilian institution in the 
Baltimore, MD or Washington, DC area for approximately 24 months of graduate 
education.  Attendance at a civilian institution is subject to length and 
academic suitability of degree program and available funding from USNA.  
Graduate education will be directly followed by a teaching assignment to USNA 
as JPMP until statutory retirement or selection to O-5.

4.  Officer community managers (OCM) will identify year groups (YG) eligible 
within designators from which a limited number of applicants may be selected.  
OCMs will also review all applicant records to ensure compliance with 
eligibility requirements.
    a.  All applicants should seek a written endorsement from their OCM to be 
included with the application package.
    b.  YG and designator waivers will be considered on a case-by- case basis 
and will be adjudicated by the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Manpower, 
Personnel, Training & Education) (OPNAV N1).

5.  The Nuclear Propulsion Program Manager (OPNAV N133) must release nuclear-
trained submarine and surface officers prior to consideration by the board.
    a.  Submarine warfare officers must have completed a department head tour 
or be senior to those currently assigned as department heads.
    b.  Surface warfare officers (Nuclear) must have completed a tour in a 
LCDR-grade nuclear billet aboard a nuclear-powered ship or be senior to those 
currently assigned as department heads.
