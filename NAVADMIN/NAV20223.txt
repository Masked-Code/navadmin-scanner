RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides amended guidance to reference (a) for the 
timing of the 2020 E-6, E-7 and E-8 periodic evaluation cycles to account for 
delays in the advancement results from the rescheduled E-7, E-8 and E-9 
selection boards addressed in references (b) and (c).  Selectees for 
advancement can expect to be assigned their original date of rank, which will 
overlap with the end of the traditional reporting periods in the case of E-6,
E-7 and E-8 periodic evaluations.  In order to relieve administrative burden 
on commands by eliminating the need to reprocess evaluations, accurately 
ensure reporting continuity for Sailors who are advanced, and to ensure 
standardized reporting across the Navy:
    a.  Reporting Seniors shall conduct normal E-6 periodic evaluations after 
the release of the Active Duty E-7 advancement results and submit E-6 
periodic evaluations to Navy Personnel Command (NPC) no later than 15 
December 2020.  The end of the reporting period will remain 15 November 2020 
for normal periodic evaluations.
        (1) Sailors selected for advancement to E-7 will receive an E-6 
Promotion/Frocking evaluation ending on 15 September 2020.  This applies to 
Active, Full-Time Support and Reserve Component Sailors.
    b.  Reporting Seniors shall conduct normal E-7 and E-8 periodic 
evaluations after the release of the Active Duty E-8 and E-9 advancement 
results and submit E-7 and E-8 periodic evaluations to NPC no later than 15 
October 2020.  The end of the reporting period will remain 15 September 2020 
for normal periodic evaluations.

2.  For questions and concerns regarding these policy changes, contact the 
MyNavy Career Center at 1-833-330-6622, or via e-mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil.
