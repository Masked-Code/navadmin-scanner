RMKS/1.  THIS MESSAGE SERVES TO ENSURE THAT SAILORS, CAREER COUNSELORS AND 
COMMAND LEADERSHIP ARE AWARE OF THE PROCESS TO OBTAIN INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION 
PAY (ISP).  THE INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN IS APPLICABLE TO ALL SAILORS 
INVOLUNTARILY RELEASED FROM ACTIVE DUTY; HOWEVER, THIS MESSAGE IS BEING 
TRANSMITTED TO ENSURE CLARITY AND TIMELY ACTION FOR ENLISTED RETENTION BOARD 
(ERB) AFFECTED SAILORS.

2.  REF A OUTLINES THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR ISP.  THESE 
REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE:
    a.  INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION
    b.  HONORABLE DISCHARGE CHARACTERIZATION
    c.  COMPLETION OF AT LEAST 6 BUT LESS THAN 20 YEARS OF ACTIVE SERVICE
    d.  ENTRY INTO A THREE-YEAR WRITTEN AGREEMENT TO SERVE IN EITHER THE 
SELECTED RESERVE (SELRES) - (COMPOSED OF DRILLING RESERVISTS IN A PAY STATUS 
WHO TYPICALLY DRILL ONE WEEKEND A MONTH AND TWO-WEEKS A YEAR) OR THE 
INDIVIDUAL READY RESERVE (IRR) - (COMPOSED OF NON-DRILLING RESERVISTS IN A 
NON-PAY STATUS).  

3.  REF B PROVIDES SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS AND OUTLINES THE PROCESS AND 
PROCEDURES INVOLUNTARILY RELEASED SAILORS SEEKING ISP MUST COMPLETE.  
CONTACT/PROCESS INFORMATION FOR AFFILIATION IN EITHER THE SELECTED RESERVE 
(DRILLING STATUS) OR INDIVIDUAL READY RESERVE (NON-DRILLING STATUS) FOLLOWS:

    A.  SELRES - DRILLING STATUS - AFFILIATION PROCESS.  ERB SEPARATING 
SAILORS COMPLETE THE NAVPERS 1070/613 AGREEMENT AND APPLY FOR SELRES QUOTAS 
AND AFFILIATION VIA FLEETRIDE/PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) REGARDLESS OF ENLISTED 
ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE.  SAILORS MAY APPLY FOR "IN-RATE ONLY," "IN-RATE 
WILLING TO CONVERT," AND "CONVERT ONLY" OPTIONS.  ONCE IN RECEIPT OF A SELRES 
QUOTA, 
SAILORS WILL BE AFFILIATED WITH THE SELECTED RESERVE VIA THE CAREER TRANSITION 
OFFICE (CTO).  IF A SELRES QUOTA IS NOT AVAILABLE, SAILORS MUST REQUEST TO 
AFFILIATE WITH THE IRR.

    B.  IRR - NON DRILLING STATUS - AFFILIATION PROCESS.  ERB SEPARATING 
SAILORS WHO DO NOT/DO NOT WISH TO AFFILIATE IN THE SELRES MUST AFFILIATE WITH 
THE IRR TO RECEIVE ISP.  PRIOR TO THE MEMBER'S DISCHARGE FROM ACTIVE DUTY AND 
PRIOR TO A PAYMENT OF SEPARATION PAY, THE SAILOR'S COMMAND WILL FORWARD A 
SIGNED COPY OF THE NAVPERS 1070/613 "AGREEMENT TO SERVE" TO SUPPORTING 
PERSONNEL OFFICE OR PERSONNEL SUPPORT DETACHMENT (PSD) FOR COMPLETION OF DD 
FORM 214 WORKSHEET.  THE PERSONNEL OFFICE/PSD WILL THEN FORWARD A COPY OF THE 
"AGREEMENT TO SERVE" AND A COMPLETED DD FORM 214 WORKSHEET TO PERS-93.  IF THE 
MEMBER IS QUALIFIED, PERS-93 WILL PREPARE THE IRR CONTRACT AND RETURN IT TO 
THE SAILOR FOR SIGNATURE.  IF FOUND NOT 
QUALIFIED, FAILURE TO BE ACCEPTED IN THE READY RESERVE DOES NOT AFFECT A 
SERVICE MEMBER'S ENTITLEMENT TO SEPARATION PAY.  IF A SIGNED NAVY RESERVE 
AFFILIATION CONTRACT IS NOT COMPLETED PRIOR TO SAILOR SEPARATING, PETITION TO 
THE BOARD OF CORRECTION FOR NAVAL RECORDS (BCNR) IS REQUIRED TO RECEIVE ISP.

4.  UNDER CURRENT LEGISLATION, ISP WILL BE REPAID UPON RECEIVING A MILITARY 
RETIREMENT (INCLUDING A RESERVE RETIREMENT).  ADDITIONAL DETAILS AND 
INFORMATION ON BENEFITS, RESERVE AFFILIATION AND ISP CAN BE FOUND AT  
HTTP://WWW.PUBLIC.NAVY.MIL/BUPERS-NPC/CAREER/TRANSITION/PAGES/ENLISTED.ASPX
OR BY CALLING 1-866-U-ASK-NPC.
