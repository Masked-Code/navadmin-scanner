the line and staff corps and chief warrant officers on the Active-Duty List 
for permanent promotion to the grades of lieutenant commander and chief 
warrant officer.

2.  A NAVADMIN announcing Part II of the Notice of Convening FY-22 promotion

5.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a promotion selection board 
via the Letter to the Board (LTB) process.  NAVADMIN
220/19 announced the introduction of a new application known as Electronic 
Submission of Selection Board Documents (ESSBD), accessible through MyNavy 
Portal (MNP).  ESSBD improves the speed, transparency, and confidence of 
receipt over current LTB submission methods, such as hard copy and e-mail 
submitted letters and related attachments.
    a.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to electronically 
submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without attachments, 
and will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) exactly what 
will be delivered and presented to the board.
    b.  To utilize ESSBD, candidates must access document services through 
MNP at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record.  On-screen instructions will 
direct the submitter thereafter.
    c.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted
