RMKS/1.  Purpose.  To announce changes in eligibility for the National 
Defense Service Medal (NDSM) and changes to the Global War on Terrorism 
Service Medal (GWOTSM) and Inherent Resolve Campaign Medal (IRCM), as ordered 
by references (a) and (b).

2.  NDSM.  Effective 31 December 2022, the authorization to award the NDSM to 
members of the U.S. Armed Forces serving on active duty on or after
11 September, 2001, is terminated.  The United States is no longer conducting 
combat operations of comparable scale for which the NDSM has been 
historically authorized.  Navy personnel who serve in support of a designated 
operation may continue to be eligible for the campaign, expeditionary, or 
service medal associated with that operation.

3.  GWOTSM.  Effective 11 September 2022, eligibility for the GWOTSM will be 
limited to Service members who directly serve in a designated military 
counter-terrorism (CT) operation for a minimum of 30 days (consecutive or 
non-consecutive), or, regardless of time served, while on active duty, are 
engaged in physical combat with, or by, a foreign terrorist or an individual 
inspired or motivated by a foreign terrorist organization.
Examples of qualifying service: deployed on orders for a designated CT 
operation; directly supported a designated CT operation on a full-time basis 
while assigned to an organization conducting such a CT operation.
"Indirect support", as previously defined in reference (c), no longer 
warrants award of the GWOTSM.

4.  IRCM.  Effective 1 July 2022, eligibility for the IRCM is limited to the 
country of Syria and its associated airspace and contiguous waters out to
12 nautical miles.

5.  Released by Mr. Andrew S. Haeuptle, Director, Navy Staff.//
