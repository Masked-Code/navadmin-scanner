RMKS/1. MILITARY SAVES WEEK, ESTABLISHED AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) PERSONAL FINANCIAL READINESS CAMPAIGN, 
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMANDERS TO ENCOURAGE SAILORS AND FAMILY 
MEMBERS TO ESTABLISH PERSONAL SAVINGS GOALS AND HABITS TO IMPROVE 
PERSONAL FINANCIAL FITNESS. THIS SOCIAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN IS DESIGNED 
TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR, BY EDUCATING OUR PERSONNEL ON HOW TO BUILD WEALTH, 
NOT DEBT.
2. THE WEEK OF 24 FEB - 2 MAR 2008 HAS BEEN SET ASIDE TO ENCOURAGE, 
MOTIVATE, AND EDUCATE SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO INCREASE PERSONAL 
SAVINGS, DECREASE DEBT, AND DEVELOP FINANCIAL FITNESS HABITS THAT LEAD 
TO IMPROVED FINANCIAL STABILITY AND OVERALL UNIT MISSION READINESS.
3. THE MILITARY SAVES CAMPAIGN, DEVELOPED THROUGH A COOPERATIVE 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN DOD AND THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA (CFA), 
ENCOURAGES LEADERSHIP TO PROMOTE WEALTH BUILDING MESSAGES AND CONDUCT 
UNIT LEVEL CAMPAIGNS AND EVENTS FOR MILITARY MEMBERS TO SET SAVINGS 
GOALS, OPEN SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, MAKE REGULAR CONTRIBUTIONS TO HOUSEHOLD 
SAVINGS, INCREASE DEBT PAYMENTS, AND PARTICIPATE IN FINANCIAL EDUCATION 
PROGRAMS.
4. THE MILITARY SAVES CAMPAIGN IS A COMMAND INITIATIVE, IN WHICH 
LEADERSHIP CAN WORK TO CREATE A CULTURE THAT ENCOURAGES SAVINGS AND 
FINANCIAL READINESS. THE COMMAND FINANCIAL SPECIALIST (CFS) SHOULD BE 
INVOLVED, ALONG WITH OTHER KEY COMMAND LEADERS, IN COORDINATING FUN 
EVENTS, WORKSHOPS AND OTHER CREATIVE ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE 
INCREASED PERSONAL SAVING BEHAVIOR.
5. COMMANDS SHOULD FULLY UTILIZE LOCAL RESOURCES (PUBLIC AFFAIRS, FLEET 
AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS, INSTALLATION BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS, CHILD 
AND YOUTH PROGRAMS, SENIOR ENLISTED ADVISORS, SPOUSE CLUBS AND 
ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE NAVY AND MARINE CORPS RELIEF SOCIETY) IN EVENT 
PLANNING. TO ASSIST IN MAKING MILITARY SAVES WEEK A SUCCESS AT YOUR 
COMMAND, RESOURCE INFORMATION AND TOOL KITS ARE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD 
AT HTTP://WWW.MILITARYSAVES.ORG.
6. FOR MILITARY SAVES WEEK 2008, A SPECIAL EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED ON 
OUR MILITARY CHILDREN AND YOUTH. AS SUCH, INSTALLATIONS ACROSS THE 
NATION ARE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONCURRENT MILITARY YOUTH 
SAVES WEEK BY PARTNERING WITH CHILD AND YOUTH PROGRAMS, SCHOOLS AND 
FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS REGARDING FUN EVENTS AND EDUCATIONAL 
FORUMS. IN ADDITION, INSTALLATION BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS WILL OFFER 
SPECIAL INCENTIVES FOR OPENING AND/OR CONTRIBUTING TO A SAVINGS ACCOUNT.
7. FINANCIAL READINESS STARTS WITH MAKING A COMMITMENT, SETTING A 
FINANCIAL GOAL AND WORKING TOWARD ACHIEVING THAT GOAL. SAILORS AND 
FAMILY MEMBERS CAN BECOME MILITARY SAVERS BY MAKING A PERSONAL 
COMMITMENT, DEVELOPING A SAVINGS PLAN, AND UTILIZING FINANCIAL 
EDUCATION SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS. 
COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO PROMOTE MAXIMUM UTILIZATION OF MILITARY 
SAVES EVENTS.
