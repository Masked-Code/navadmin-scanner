ADMINISTRATION IN THE U.S. NAVY.  
2.  DLPT5 
    A.  CURRENT DLPT5 TESTS OF RECORD:
        ALBANIAN				ARABIC (MSA) 
        CHINESE-MANDARIN			DARI
        EGYPTIAN				GREEK
        HINDI					IRAQI (LISTENING ONLY)
        JAPANESE				KURDISH-SORANI
        LEVANTINE (LISTENING ONLY)		NORWEGIAN
        PASHTO					PERSIAN-FARSI
        RUSSIAN					SERBO-CROATIAN
        SPANISH					URDU
    B.  MSA DLPT5.  REF F ANNOUNCED THE TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THE MSA 
DLPT5 PENDING RESOLUTION OF TEST ANOMALIES, AND PROVIDED TEMPORARY 
WAIVER GUIDANCE FOR THOSE SAILORS RECERTIFYING FOR PURPOSES OF FLPB.  
REF G CONFIRMED RESOLUTION OF MSA DLPT5 TEST ANOMALIES AND REINSTATED 
IT AS THE OFFICIAL TEST OF RECORD.  THE ONE-YEAR TRANSITION WAIVER 
AUTHORIZED FOR MSA ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007 AND WILL NOT BE EXTENDED.  
    C.  WAIVER POLICY  
        (1) DLPT5 RECERTIFICATION.  BECAUSE THE DLPT5 IS A MORE 
CHALLENGING PROFICIENCY EXAM, DOD AUTHORIZED THE SERVICES TO RECERTIFY 
MEMBERS FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD USING SCORES FROM THEIR LAST RECORDED 
DLPT IF A DLPT5 EXAM RESULTED IN LOWER SCORES.  
REF E IMPLEMENTED THE DOD POLICY WITHIN NAVY FOR ONE YEAR EFFECTIVE 31 
DECEMBER 2006 AND APPLIED THE WAIVER TO DLPT5 EXAMS RELEASED PRIOR TO 1 
OCTOBER 2007.  THE ONE-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD EXPIRED 31 DECEMBER 2007; 
HOWEVER, SCORE WAIVERS EXECUTED PRIOR TO 31 DECEMBER 2007 WILL REMAIN 
EFFECTIVE FOR A MAXIMUM OF ONE YEAR.  AT THE END OF THE ONE-YEAR WAIVER, 
ANNUAL CERTIFICATION FOR FLPB SHALL BE BASED SOLELY ON DLPT5. 
        (2) TRANSITION/WAIVER POLICY FOR DLPT5 EXAMS ACTIVATED AFTER 1 
OCTOBER 2007.  AS TESTS IN ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES ARE CONVERTED TO DLPT5, 
THE SAME ONE-YEAR TRANSITION POLICY DESCRIBED ABOVE WILL APPLY.  THE 
TRANSITION PERIOD BEGINS ON THE DATE THE NEWLY-DEPLOYED DLPT5 BECOMES 
THE OFFICIAL TEST OF RECORD IN A PARTICULAR FOREIGN LANGUAGE.  DURING 
THIS PERIOD, SAILORS WILL TEST IN THE NEW DLPT5 VERSION ON OR BEFORE 
THEIR NORMAL ANNUAL RECERTIFICATION DATE.  IF THEIR CORRESPONDING DLPT5 
SCORE DECLINES FROM THE LAST RECORDED PRE-DLPT5 EXAM IN THE SAME 
LANGUAGE, THE SAILOR WILL HAVE THE OPTION OF USING HIS/HER EXPIRING 
PRE-DLPT5 SCORE TO EXTEND FLPB CERTIFICATION FOR ONE CALENDAR YEAR.  
SUBSEQUENT CERTIFICATIONS IN THE SAME LANGUAGE; HOWEVER, WILL BE BASED 
SOLELY ON DLPT5 SCORES.  THE ORAL PROFICIENCY INTERVIEW (OPI) REMAINS 
THE OFFICIAL TEST FOR MEASURING SPEAKING PROFICIENCY.  
3.  WEB-ENABLED, NON-DLPT5 EXAMS.  TO ACCELERATE AVAILABILITY OF 
LANGUAGE TESTING TO THE BROADER DOD CONSTITUENCY, DEFENSE LANGUAGE 
INSTITUTE FOREIGN LANGUAGE CENTER HAS BEGUN TO TRANSITION VERSION 1 
THROUGH 4 DLPT EXAMS FOR ADMINISTRATION VIA THE WEB.  ALTHOUGH WEB-
BASED, THESE EXAMS ARE NOT DLPT5 VARIANTS.  THEREFORE, THE WAIVER 
POLICY DESCRIBED ABOVE DOES NOT APPLY TO THEM.  CURRENT 
WEB-BASED (NON-DLPT5) LANGUAGE TESTS INCLUDE:    

    BULGARIAN				BURMESE 
    CAMBODIAN 				CANTONESE 
    CHINESE-AMOY 				CZECH
    DANISH 					DUTCH 				
    FRENCH					GERMAN
    HAUSA (EFFECTIVE 15 JUN 08)	HEBREW
    HUNGARIAN 				ICELANDIC
    INDONESIAN 				ITALIAN
    KOREAN					LAO 
    LITHUANIAN 				POLISH
    PORTUGUESE-BRAZILIAN		PORTUGUESE-EUROPEAN

    SWEDISH					TAGALOG
    THAI					TURKISH
    UKRAINIAN				VIETNAMESE 					
     YIDDISH (EFFECTIVE 15 JUNE 2008)
     
4.  POLICY FOR TESTING IN LOCATIONS WHERE WEB-ENABLED EXAMS ARE NOT 
AVAILABLE.  IF A MEMBER IS OVERSEAS AND WEB-BASED TESTING IS NOT 
AVAILABLE, THE DLPT ANNUAL RECERTIFICATION REQUIREMENT WILL BE 
SATISFIED VIA OPI.  IF THE MEMBER IS DEPLOYED TO A REGION OVERSEAS 
WHERE NEITHER WEB-BASED TESTING NOR OPI IS AVAILABLE, THE DLPT ANNUAL 
RECERTIFICATION REQUIREMENT IS WAIVED PENDING THE INDIVIDUAL'S RETURN 
FROM OCONUS ASSIGNMENT.  IN THESE CASES, RECERTIFICATION IS REQUIRED 
WITHIN 90 DAYS OF RETURN TO CONUS.  IN ALL CASES, TEST NON-AVAILABILITY 
MUST BE VERIFIED BY NAVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROFESSIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY CENTER (NETPDTC).
5.  EXPANDED AVAILABILITY OF WEB-BASED DLPT.  WEB-BASED DLPT IS 
AVAILABLE THROUGH THE NAVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND'S TRANET 
SYSTEM, WHICH PROVIDES ACCESS AT SELECT NAVY COLLEGE OFFICES (NCO) AND 
NAVY ACCESSION POINTS.  ADDITIONALLY, DEPLOYMENT OF WEB-BASED DLPT 
WITHIN THE OVERSEAS ONE-NET ENTERPRISE WAS AUTHORIZED 18 MARCH 2008 AND 
IS BEING IMPLEMENTED ON SPECIALLY-CONFIGURED COMPUTERS AT KEY NAVY 
INSTALLATIONS.  CURRENT/PROJECTED TEST LOCATIONS INCLUDE:
