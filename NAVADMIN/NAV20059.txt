REF/A/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON DC/251459ZOCT18//
AMPN/REF A IS NAVADMIN 263/18, UPDATE TO NAVY GRADUATE EDUCATION PROGRAM.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Navy Strategic 
Education and Academic (SEA) Plan and provides guidance on the method to 
notify Sailors of education program information, applications and deadlines 
going forward.

2.  Navy's graduate education program supports our National Defense Strategy 
by developing Navy leaders who understand the art and science of warfighting 
and can lead in complex strategic environments.  To this end, the FY21 
Strategic Education and Academic (SEA) Plan is aimed at ensuring the highest 
performing individuals are sought out, encouraged and placed in selective 
graduate level programs that will enhance our warfighting advantage.

3.  The FY21 SEA Plan provides over 1,300 opportunities for degree and non-
degree programs.  Participation in these educational opportunities is an 
investment in our future that will ensure our leaders have the skills and 
knowledge to meet the challenges ahead, and maximize the lethality of our 
force.

4.  To align with policy changes for In-Residence Graduate Education
(IRGE) included in reference (a), selection for FY-21 SEA Plan opportunities 
for unrestricted line officers will be conducted through administrative 
boards to screen the most fully qualified, due course officers for top-line, 
in-residence graduate education and in-residence Joint Professional Military 
Education opportunities.

5.  To target distribution, reduce administrative distractions and align with 
identity management requirements, education program announcements will no 
longer be promulgated via NAVADMIN.  Instead, these announcements will be 
delivered through MyNavy Education, a web-based application.
Sailors are strongly encouraged to log into the system and update their 
profile and e-mail addresses in MyNavy Education to receive alerts in the 
event of program updates.  For a list of education programs and instructions 
on how to receive notifications via MyNavy Education, please visit 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/training-education-qualifications/
e-graduate-education-and-fellowship-programs.

6.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.

7.  Released by Vice Admiral S. B. Munsch, N7.//
