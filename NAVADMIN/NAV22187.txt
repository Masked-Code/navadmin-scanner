RMKS/1.  Purpose.  To inform Navy Service Members that the Novavax 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine is now available. 
 
2.  The Food and Drug Administration recently approved the Novavax 
COVID-19 vaccine under an emergency use authorization for a two-dose 
primary series to individuals 18 years of age and older. 
Unvaccinated Navy Service Members who choose to receive the Novavax 
COVID-19 vaccine series satisfy the vaccine requirement specified in 
references (a) and (b).  Additional vaccines that also meet that 
requirement include Janssen (manufactured by Johnson and Johnson), 
Pfizer-BioNTech, and Moderna. 
 
3.  Action.  Commanders are directed to counsel any unvaccinated 
Navy Service Members under their command regarding the fact that 
receiving the Novavax vaccine series satisfies the requirement in 
references (a) and (b).  Additionally, commanders shall provide such 
Service Members the following link which provides more information 
regarding all authorized COVID-19 vaccines, 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html.  If 
an unvaccinated Service Member becomes fully vaccinated for COVID- 
19, it is the Navy’s intent to retain that Service Member, barring 
other misconduct or reasons for involuntary separation. 
 
4.  Action.  Commanders are directed to report any previously 
unvaccinated Navy Service Member who completes an approved vaccine 
series via email to both of the following addresses: 
ALTN_Navy_Religious_Accommodations(at)navy.mil and

ID number in all such reports.  Commanders shall also ensure the

site.
