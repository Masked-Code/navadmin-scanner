RMKS/1. THE NAVY HAS CELLULAR LINES CONTRACTED BY INSTALLATIONS AND 
COMMANDS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN USED, SOME IN 
EXCESS OF TWO YEARS THAT ARE CONSIDERED INACTIVE BY THE SERVICING 
CELLULAR PROVIDER. THE NAVY CONTINUES TO PAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE TO KEEP 
THESE LINES IN SERVICE COSTING OVER $3.8 MILLION PER YEAR.
2. EFFECTIVE 1 OCT 07, OPNAV N6 DIRECTS ALL CONUS COMMANDS AND 
INSTALLATIONS TO REVIEW THEIR EXISTING CELLULAR, BLACKBERRY CONTRACTS 
THROUGH ONE OF THE MANDATED CONTRACT VEHICLES: FLEET INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY 
CENTER SAN DIEGO (FISCSD), AND THE NAVY MARINE CORPS INTRANET (NMCI).  
OPNAV N6 HAS REQUESTED THAT THE RESPECTIVE CELLULAR VENDORS PROVIDE TO 
OPNAV N6 NLT 12 OCT 07, A LISTING OF ALL LINES THAT ARE CURRENTLY 
INACTIVE. COMMANDS AND INSTALLATIONS ARE THEN REQUESTED TO USE THIS 
VENDOR PROVIDED DATA OR EXECUTE AT THEIR OWN INITIATIVE NLT 16 NOV 07, 
THE TERMINATION OF ALL CELLULAR LINES (VOICE OR DATA) THAT HAVE NOT 
BEEN USED IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS. ANY LINE THAT IS DORMANT LESS THAN 
SIX MONTHS WILL BE SWITCHED TO A PAY-AS-YOU-GO RATE.  LINE USAGE WILL 
BE DETERMINED BY THE CELLULAR VENDOR?S BILLING RECORDS. DATA HAS ALSO 
BEEN REQUESTED BY VENDORS OUTSIDE OF THE FISCSD AND NMCI CONTRACTS; ANY 
COMMAND OR INSTALLATION FOUND IN VIOLATION OF REF A WILL HAVE THEIR 
FUNDING TERMINATED FOR CELLULAR IN FY09.
3. THOSE INSTALLATIONS OR COMMANDS CARRYING DORMANT LINES FOR 
CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS PLANNING (COOP) PURPOSES ARE DIRECTED TO CARRY 
THOSE LINES AT A MINIMUM, ON A PAY-AS-YOU-GO RATE OR A PREFERRED METHOD 
OF ESTABLISHING A MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT WITH THE CELLULAR VENDOR TO 
PROVIDE LINES IN TIME OF CRISIS (PHONES ON THE GO) ON AN AS NEEDED 
BASIS AT A PRE-DETERMINED COST RATHER THAN CARRY THESE LINES IN EXCESS. 
IN THE RARE INSTANCE WHERE A ZEROED CELLULAR LINE IS TERMINATED THAT IS 
REQUIRED FOR COOP, THE LOCAL COMMAND CAN AUTHORIZE A RECONNECT THROUGH 
THE FISCSD OR NMCI CONTRACTS.
4. ECHELON II COMMANDS (CONUS) WILL PROVIDE REPORT EVERY 30 DAYS TO 
OPNAV N6 STARTING 01 DEC 07, AND UNTIL ALL AFFECTED LINES ARE ADDRESSED, 
VIA MR. PETE MARTI AT PETE.MARTI.CTR(AT)NAVY.MIL. REPORT WILL CONTAIN 
STATUS OF TERMINATIONS, RATE SWITCHES AND COMMAND STRATEGY TO MAKE THIS 
A REOCCURRING ASSESSMENT OF LINES CONTRACTED IN THE FUTURE. FISCSD AND 
PEO-EIS ARE ENCOURAGED TO WORK WITH ASN(RDA), DONCIO AND OPNAV N6 ON 
INSTITUTING CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS TO ENSURE COOP PLANNING AND 
EFFECTIVE MONITORING OF LINES IS EXECUTED IN THE FUTURE.
5. THIS NOTICE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE NAVY?S OVERALL EFFORT TO OPTIMIZE 
AND REDUCE LEGACY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS.
