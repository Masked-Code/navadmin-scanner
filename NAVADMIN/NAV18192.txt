NARR/REF A IS MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1160-120, HIGH YEAR TENURE.  REF B IS 
NAVADMIN 095/18, BRILLIANT ON THE BASICS II PART A REVISITING THE BASICS.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces increased high year tenure (HYT) waiver 
opportunities for hard-charging E7-E9s who want to stay Navy.
In accordance with reference (a), E7s must retire at 24 years of service 
(YOS), E8s at 26 YOS, and E9s at 30 YOS.  However, as part of our Sailor 2025 
Up-And-Stay initiative, we are granting more HYT waivers to E7-E9s who are 
willing to serve at sea or in other hard jobs and continue their Naval 
service.  This is not to say that you will remain in your current paygrade.  
Your opportunity to advance will continue and in our growing Navy is expected 
to remain high, especially for those Sailors willing to do the hard jobs with 
sustained superior performance.  HYT policy allows for continued advancement 
opportunity and prevents Sailors who are on the retired on active duty (ROAD) 
program from staying by requiring Command endorsement.  COs are expected to 
recommend approval of HYT requests only for Sailors who demonstrate sustained 
superior performance.

2.  As I said in my message to the Fleet, Brilliant on the Basics II 
reference (b), to build the Navy the Nation Needs, we need Sailors who are 
personally engaged in the success of our Navy as well as their own personal 
success.  Similarly, we need leaders who encourage and enable this.  This 
initiative to provide increased opportunity for our senior enlisted leaders 
to stay Navy will help us maintain the leadership experience and technical 
acumen we need at sea as we grow the force.  It also allows our senior 
enlisted leaders to continue to perform and compete for advancement.

3.  If you are a senior enlisted leader who is approaching your HYT gate and 
still want to compete and serve the Navy, reach out to your community manager 
and start the process now.

Branch BUPERS-328C, (901) 874-3048/DSN 882, or via e-mail at
