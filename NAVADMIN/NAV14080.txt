PRIOR VERSIONS OF MICROSOFT OPERATING SYSTEMS.  REF B IS WINDOWS XP SECURITY 
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE V6 RELEASE 1.31.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides additional Navy-specific policy and direction 
for all Navy ashore and afloat systems/applications that continue to use 
Windows XP and older Operating Systems (OS) and associated applications.  
This is a coordinated OPNAV/Fleet Cyber Command message.

2.  Ref A directed ashore program managers to migrate all systems and 
applications to Microsoft Windows 7 (MS WIN 7) or newer versions of MS OS no 
later than 31 December 2013 and prohibited ashore program and system managers 
from negotiating support contracts with vendors for MS Windows XP and older 
OS.  Ref A mandate to migrate to WIN 7 remains in effect.  Effective 8 April 
2014, Microsoft ceases support for Windows XP, Microsoft Office 2003 and 
applications prior to the release of WIN 7 OS.  Subsequently, all non-WIN 7 
OS compatible or compliant IT systems and applications adversely impact the 
U.S. Navy and DoD cyber security posture.

3.  Navy has negotiated an agreement with Microsoft to provide extended 
vendor customer support to non-WIN 7 compliant ashore systems from 8 April 
2014 to 14 April 2015.  This extended support is available only to systems 
that have received Deputy Chief Information Officer (Navy) (DDCIO(N))-
approved waivers and have submitted an associated Plan of Action and 
Milestones (POA&M) for migration.  The cost of extended support will be 
allocated among system owners who require it.  

4.  Any system owner whose environment continues to use Windows XP OS, 
Microsoft Office 2003, or older MS platforms, and who has not received an 
approved DDCIO(N) waiver, shall submit a Resource Sponsor-approved waiver 
request and WIN 7 migration POA&M to DDCIO(N) no later than 2 May 2014 IAW 
ref A.  Any system or application that has not received a DDCIO(N)-approved 
waiver with a POA&M is subject to disconnection on 9 May 2014.

5.  After 8 April 2014, non-WIN 7 compatible systems and applications will be 
categorized as having Category I vulnerabilities per ref B.  In coordination 
with OPNAV, FCC will provide additional guidance for non-compliant system 
owners operating under a current Authorization to Operate if the CAT I 
weakness was discovered after original authorization and cannot be corrected 
within 30 days.  This guidance will outline the Interim Authorization to 
Operate process.

6.  Mitigations outlined in para 3 and 5 above do not abrogate the 
responsibility of system owners to migrate to WIN 7 as soon as possible.  

7.  Eradication of WIN XP for afloat capabilities and associated timelines 
will be addressed SEPCOR.  However, stipulations of para 5 regarding CAT I 
vulnerabilities in non-compliant systems are germane to both ashore and 
afloat environments. 

8.  Points of contact are Mr. Joseph Walker at (571) 256-8523/DSN:  223 or 
joe.t.walker(at)navy.mil and Ms. Brooke Zimmerman at (571) 256-8521/DSN:  223 
or brooke.zimmerman(at)navy.mil.// 

9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded. 

10.  Released by VADM Ted N. Branch, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, 
Information Dominance, OPNAV N2N6.//
