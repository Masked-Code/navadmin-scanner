NARR/REF A is Naval Inspector General Policy Memorandum Number 001 on Command 
Inspector General Investigations 
 
RMKS/1. On 4 May 2023, the Naval Inspector General (NAVIG) implemented 
reference (a) in accordance with his authority in reference (b). The purpose 
of the new policy is to more closely align the NAVIG Enterprise with the 
scope of investigations to which other Services appoint Inspectors General 
(IG), as well as to ensure independence and avoid conflicts in furtherance of 
the mission of the NAVIG Enterprise to operate "without command influence, 
pressure, coercion, or fear of reprisal" in accordance with reference (b). 
 
2. Reference (a) is effective on date of issuance for new investigations, but 
allows for conclusion of ongoing investigations that were commenced prior to 
issuance. 
 
3. In accordance with references (b) through (f), which establish the roles 
and authorities of the NAVIG, the new policy guidance clarifies that NAVIG 
Enterprise personnel shall not conduct, or be involved in conducting, 
investigations of matters that are not IG appropriate or that are conducted 
under other authorities, such as Preliminary Inquiries or 
Command Investigations pursuant to reference (g) and safety investigations 
pursuant to reference (h). 
 
4. Reference (a) allows activity commanders with an assigned command IG to 
direct IG-appropriate investigations by their respective command IGs and 
personnel in the NAVIG Enterprise.  All such investigations must be conducted 
in accordance with applicable DOD, SECNAV, and NAVIG regulations, policies, 
and guidance. 
    a.  Unless commanders are granted a written exception by NAVIG, NAVIG 
Enterprise personnel shall not conduct, or be assigned to conduct, 
investigations of matters that are not IG-appropriate or that are conducted 
under other authorities. 
    b. Commanders retain the authority to implement corrective actions as 
they deem appropriate. 
    c.  Reference (a) does not affect other aspects of IG work such as 
reviews, assessments, and inspections that command IGs perform to support the 
command. 
 
5. The Office of the Naval Inspector General will provide the signed policy 
directly to Echelon I and II Enterprise IGs and it is available to all NAVIG 
Enterprise personnel on the NAVIG internal SharePoint site. 
 
6. Released by Mr. Andrew S. Haeuptle, Director, Navy Staff on behalf of 
VADM John V. Fuller, Naval Inspector General (NAVIG).
