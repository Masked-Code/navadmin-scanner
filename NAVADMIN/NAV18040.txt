SUBJ//NEW INSTRUCTION FOR CY2017 COR SUBMISSION//

REF/A/DOC/OPNAVINST 5750.12/
NARR/REF A IS CNO INSTRUCTION ON ANNUAL COMMAND OPERATIONS REPORT//

RMKS/1.  Per reference (a), all Navy Echelon II and subordinate commands are 
responsible for submitting a Command Operations Report (COR) for their unit 
annually.  Calendar year 2017 CORs are due 1 March 2018.  This NAVADMIN 
provides updated information on COR submission guidance and resources to 
assist submissions as reflected in the upcoming update to OPNAVINST 5750.12.

2.  CORs are one of the most important records each command creates.  They 
are kept permanently while many other reports are not.  CORs are the Navy's 
primary source for operational data and this information is used to support 
the researchers, Fleet, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, the Joint 
Staff, and Congress.  This data is needed to understand and improve the 
Navy's mission execution.  CORs are also a key source of information for 
veterans needing documentation of their time in the Navy.

3.  The COR shall include information about classified operations during the 
reporting period, and be classified appropriately.  The COR cannot be vague 
and must be descriptive.  Include documentation like Post-Deployment Briefs, 
After Action Reports and Causality Reports.  CORs classified no higher than 
the Secret level may be submitted using SIPRNet at: 
NHHC_COR(AT)navy.smil.mil.  Reports classified higher than Secret are also 
accepted.  Contact listed SIPRNet email for information about submitting Top 
Secret and/or Sensitive Compartmented Information material.

4.  Each unit shall submit their own report with only one exception: if a 
command has fewer than 10 members, their immediate superior in charge can 
submit on their behalf.  If a command has 10 or more members - military, 
civilian, and/or contractor - they must submit their own report.

5.  CORs should be submitted to the Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC) 
either electronically or using digital media.  Paper CORs are strongly 
discouraged as they are frequently damaged by the irradiation process.

6.  Reference (a), a template with guidance, and examples may be downloaded 
from the NHHC's COR website at
https://www.history.navy.mil/about-us/instructions-and-forms/submit-a
-command-operations-report.html.  Calendar year 2016 submission template 
matching OPNAVINST 5750.12K CH-1 may also be used for this year's 
submissions.  Questions about the report should be directed to email:  
NHHC_COR(AT)navy.mil or NHHC_COR(AT)navy.smil.mil.

7.  Point of Contact is the COR Program and may be contacted at comm:
(202) 433-9873 and email: NHHC_COR(AT)navy.mil or NHHC_COR(AT)navy.smil.mil.
