SUBJ/PEARL HARBOR REMEMBRANCE DAY MESSAGE TO THE FLEET// 
 
RMKS/1. On a Sunday morning 82 years ago, waves of Imperial Japanese 
Navy aircraft launched from carriers and targeted the United States 
Pacific Fleet. The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor took the lives 
of 2,403 Americans and serves as a defining moment for our Navy and 
our Nation. As President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, December 7, 
1941, is "a date which will live in infamy." 
 
2. Besides the steep human toll, the Fleet suffered five battleships 
sunk, three battleships damaged, and numerous other vessels and 
aircraft destroyed. Yet, despite the losses, the Fleet regrouped, 
rallied, and sailed ahead. Seven months later in June 1942, our 
victory at the Battle of Midway marked a turning point in the war 
in the Pacific. And, while our Navy's platforms were important to 
our success, we must never forget that it's our people who won the 
fight. 
 
3. On this Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we honor the unmatched 
resilience and heroism displayed by our fellow Sailors and Marines, 
with sixteen awarded the Medal of Honor. These recipients include 
Seaman First Class James Richard Ward aboard USS Oklahoma (BB-37) 
who, despite the call to 'abandon ship,' remained in a turret as 
the ship capsized, ultimately giving his life for his Shipmates. 
Later this month, Seaman Ward will be interred at Arlington National 
Cemetery. 
 
4. The brave actions of so many on that fateful day stand eternal as 
part of our Navy's rich history. As we reflect on their service and 
sacrifice, recognize that each of us are forever linked to those 
Shipmates through our core values - a shared legacy of serving with 
Honor, Courage, and Commitment.
