SUBJ/125TH CHIEF PETTY OFFICER BIRTHDAY MESSAGE//

RMKS/1.  April 1st will mark 125 years of Chief Petty Officers serving as 
"The backbone of our Navy."  The Chief Petty Officers continue to serve as 
visible, more authentic, competent, courageous, and confidently humble 
deckplate leaders in leading our Navy team forward every day.

2.  As we celebrate our heritage with good grace, let us reflect on and honor 
the expertise, grit, and devotion of those who wore anchors before us.  They 
shaped the Chief Petty Officer rate into the time honored respected and 
revered fellowship simply known today as "The Mess" - recognized worldwide 
for its distinct leadership in accomplishing the Navy's mission.

3.  Chief Petty Officers must continue to build on the achievements and 
lessons of the past 125 years.  To ensure the Navy achieves operational 
excellence and that our Sailors, civilians, and families get the support they 
need to contribute to our mission success, we serve as trusted leaders, 
technical experts, advisors, and mentors.  We do so guided by the wisdom of 
the Chief Petty Officer Creed - a timeless living document.

4.  It is truly an honor and humbling to serve as part of such a long-
standing and valued legacy.  The tireless efforts of Chief Petty Officers, 
past and present, are the cornerstone of our Navy's continued success as the 
world's premiere combat ready force.

5.  Stay safe and Happy 125TH Birthday Chiefs!

6.  MCPON Giordano sends.//
