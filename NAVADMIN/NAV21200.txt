SUBJ/2021 OMBUDSMAN APPRECIATION DAY// 
 
RMKS/1.  September 14 is Ombudsman Appreciation Day.  A day for the Navy to 
show its appreciation to command Ombudsman for their volunteerism and 
dedication to supporting our Navy and its families.  Please take this 
opportunity to formally recognize your command Ombudsman and the many 
benefits of the Ombudsman Program.  This practice goes back to the inception 
of the Ombudsman Program in 1970, when ADM Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr., introduced 
the Navy Family Command Ombudsman Program via Z-Gram 24. 
 
2.  Navy team, our selfless Ombudsman volunteers are crucial to the success 
of our Navy and their contributions to the success of the command's mission 
are immeasurable.  Their support to Navy families enable Sailors and commands 
to focus on mission requirements while knowing that their families have a 
trained and reliable resource to provide support on the home front. 
 
3.  Commanders and command triads, you play a critical role in ensuring your 
Ombudsman are properly prepared and always have a direct line of 
communication with you to assist your Sailors. 
4.  Ombudsman Coordinators, you serve as an invaluable resource to Ombudsman 
and Commanders.  Your guidance and understanding of the Ombudsman Program 
provide a firm foundation to all who are affiliated with the program. 
 
5.  Ombudsman, congratulations on 51 impressive years of dedicated service 
and support!  Thank you for all you do and BRAVO ZULU! 
 
6.  Released by Admiral Mike Gilday, Chief of Naval Operations.//
