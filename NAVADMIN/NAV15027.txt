RMKS/1.  The Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Maintenance Awards Program 
acknowledges maintenance excellence by formally recognizing field-level 
military units responsible for outstanding achievements in maintenance 
management and production.  SECDEF presents six Service-wide maintenance 
awards annually to the most outstanding large, medium, and small Department 
of Defense (DoD) maintenance organizations.  One of these six winners is then 
recognized as the best of the best and is awarded the SECDEF Phoenix Trophy.

2.  Competitive Categories:
    A.  Large:  1000 or more authorized personnel
    B.  Medium: 301-999 authorized personnel
    C.  Small:  up to 300 authorized personnel

3.  All active and reserve component field-level commands and units 
responsible for organizational and intermediate-level maintenance on weapons 
systems and/or equipment belonging to their own unit, or to other units, are 
eligible to compete.  Examples of eligible activities include ships, 
squadrons, Fleet Readiness Centers, Naval Stations, etc.  A component of a 
command such as a repair department of a submarine base may be nominated if 
that component is assigned a Unit Identification Code (UIC) distinct from the 
command as a whole.  The preponderance of unit staffing shall be comprised of 
uniformed U.S. military personnel and may also include DoD civilians.  The 
2015 SECDEF maintenance award competitive period covers fiscal year 2014.  
The 2015 awards will be presented at a formal ceremony at a date to be 
announced.

4.  Echelon II commanders shall review and screen nominations from their 
respective commands and may submit up to two SECDEF field level maintenance 
award nominations per category to OPNAV(N4).  OPNAV(N4) will evaluate the 
nominations and forward two nominees per category to SECDEF for award 
consideration.

5.  Each nomination package shall be submitted in .pdf format on a CD and 
include a separate high resolution image file of their unit logo (minimum of 
300 DPI JPG file).  Please pay special attention to the requirements outlined 
in ref (a) with regards to the ten (10) page limitation for the nomination 
packages and the three weighted evaluation factors for field-level units.
Additionally, it is imperative that Navy packages highlight accomplishments 
exceeding an established baseline above the normal. Follow on messages will 
announce Navy nominees and SECDEF field level maintenance award winners.

Dan Schrader and post marked no later than 13 March 2015 to the following
