(b), this NAVADMIN, and the general examination verbatim instructions are

advancement opportunity for the current advancement cycle.
    c.  Education points:  Education points will be awarded for the highest 
accredited degree held; (two points for an Associate's Degree or four points 
for a Baccalaureate Degree or above).  To allow sufficient time for the Navy
