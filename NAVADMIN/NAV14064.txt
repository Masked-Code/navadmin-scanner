RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE GUIDANCE ON COMMAND CLIMATE ASSESSMENTS.  
ON 1 JANUARY 2014, THE DEFENSE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE (DEOMI) 
ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE SURVEY (DEOCS)

4.0 WAS RELEASED.  INFORMATION ON THE NEW DEOCS 4.0 IS AVAILABLE IN DETAIL 
ONLINE AT HTTP://WWW.PUBLIC.NAVY.MIL/BUPERS-NPC/SUPPORT/21ST_
CENTURY_SAILOR/EQUAL_OPPORTUNITY/PAGES/COMMANDCLIMATEASSESSMENT.ASPX.

2.  WITH THE RECENT IMPLEMENTATION OF DEOCS 4.0 GENERATION OF CLIMATE 
ASSESSMENT REPORTS ARE CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE TO DETERMINE NAVY SPECIFIC 
AVERAGES BECAUSE THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT NUMBER OF COMMAND RESPONSES RECEIVED 
BY DEOMI ON WHICH TO COMPUTE THE AVERAGES.  THE PROCESS WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL 
TIME AND DEOMI HAS DELAYED ALL REPORT GENERATION REQUESTS UNTIL ENOUGH DATA 
HAS BEEN RECEIVED TO COMPUTE SERVICE AVERAGES.  DELAYS WITH RELEASE OF 
SURVEYS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGHOUT MARCH AND RETURN TO NORMAL 
OPERATIONS BY APRIL 2014.

3.  IF YOU OR ONE OF YOUR SUBORDINATE COMMANDS FALLS INTO THIS SITUATION, 
YOUR COURSE OF ACTION WILL BE:
    A.  COMPLETE A DEOCS SURVEY AS REQUIRED PER YOUR CHANGE OF COMMAND AND/OR 
ANNUAL DEOCS REQUIREMENT.
    B.  ONCE YOU COMPLETE YOUR DEOCS, ATTEMPT TO DOWNLOAD THE SURVEY RESULTS.
    C.  WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE AUTOMATIC REPLY FROM DEOMI REGARDING THE 
CHALLENGE LISTED ABOVE, SAVE THE RESPONSE E-MAIL IN YOUR ARCHIVES AND 
COMPLETE A MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD (MFR).
    D.  ONCE YOU ARE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD THE SURVEY RESULTS, YOU WILL ATTACH THE 
E-MAIL AND THE MFR WITH YOUR EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND PLAN OF ACTION AND 
MILESTONES AND WILL NOT BE PENALIZED FOR ANY DELAYS IN COMPLETION.
    E.  TIMELINES OUTLINED IN REF (A) WILL STILL BE ADHERED TO FOLLOWING 
RECEIPT OF THE DEOCS SURVEY RESULTS.

4.  ADDITIONALLY, TO ENHANCE COMMANDER ACCOUNTABILITY, THE FOLLOWING ARE 
EXCEPTIONS TO REF (B) ON THE CONDUCT OF COMMAND CLIMATE ASSESSMENTS FOR UNITS 
OF FEWER THAN 50 PERSONNEL OR WITH FEWER THAN
16 PERSONNEL OR 16 RESPONDENTS:
    A.  EACH UNIT, REGARDLESS OF SIZE, IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A COMMAND 
CLIMATE ASSESSMENT.
    B.  UNITS WITH FEWER THAN 16 PERSONNEL OR 16 RESPONDENTS ON THE DEOMI 
DEOCS SHALL CONDUCT A CLIMATE ASSESSMENT VIA FOCUS GROUPS, INTERVIEWS, 
REVIEWING RECORDS AND REPORTS, AND OBSERVATIONS.  A FACE-TO-FACE DEBRIEF OF 
THE COMMAND CLIMATE ASSESSMENT RESULTS WILL BE DEBRIEFED BY THE COMMANDER TO 
THE NEXT LEVEL IN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND, WITHIN 60 DAYS OF COMPLETION OF THE 
COMMAND CLIMATE ASSESSMENT.

5.  THIS MESSAGE WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL IT IS INCORPORATED INTO REF (C).
