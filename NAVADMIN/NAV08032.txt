EACH COMMANDER IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL ASSIGNED PERSONNEL AND THEIR 
FAMILY MEMBER CATEGORIES SPECIFIED IN REF B.
3.  LESSONS LEARNED DURING THE RECENT SOCAL WILDFIRES AND SEVERAL LARGE 
SCALE NAVY PERSONNEL ACCOUNTABILITY (PA) EXERCISES HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE 
NEED FOR ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH REPORTING

COMMANDS SHOULD BE PREPARED TO EXECUTE PA FOLLOWING A DISASTER WHERE 
THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF WIDESPREAD INJURY OR DEATH, THE SCOPE OF

PA PROCEDURES DO NOT SUPPLANT THE NEED TO REPORT CASUALTIES IAW REF D, 
ARTICLE 1770.  PA PROCEDURES WILL BE INITIATED BY PROMULGATION OF A 
NAVADMIN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FROM CNO (N1).  ADDITIONAL AMPLIFYING 
GUIDANCE WILL BE CONTAINED IN A FORTHCOMING OPNAVINST ON PERSONNEL

        (3)  NFAAS CONTAINS AN ENHANCED NAVY FAMILY MEMBER SITE FOR 
INDIVIDUAL USERS AND A SUPPORT SITE FOR COMMAND REPRESENTATIVES.
    B.  A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM BOL DMT WILL ALLOW THE INDIVIDUAL 
NAVY FAMILY MEMBER TO REPORT LOCATION AND CONTACT INFORMATION TO

ACTION HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE REQUIRED TO ACCOUNT FOR 
PERSONNEL/FAMILY MEMBERS BY VERIFYING THE INDIVIDUAL STATUS AND 
WHEREABOUTS.
