AMPN/REF A IS MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT, NAVY DIETITIAN SUPPORT TO OPERATIONAL 
FORCES.//

RMKS/1.  In support of increasing lethality in our force, the Navy Dietitian 
Support to Operational Forces focuses on the wellbeing of the Sailor to 
deliver nutrition education and counseling to Sailors in their work spaces.  
This aligns with the direction of the Secretary of the Navy to increase 
awareness, use, and relevance of dietitians to the Fleet.

2.  This NAVADMIN announces the collaborative effort between the Bureau of 
Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations 
(Manpower, Personnel, Training, and Education) (N1) to send Navy uniformed 
dietitians to the Fleet to meet the needs of each command and their Sailors.  
Reference (a) establishes the collaborative relationship between BUMED and 
N1.  This initiative supports the Fleet by providing experts in nutrition, 
performance, and food behavior change to increase Sailor operational 
readiness, resiliency and retention.

3.  Commanding officers (CO) may submit a letter to the CO of the Medical 
Treatment Facility requesting a dietitian be assigned in a Temporary Assigned 
Duty (TAD) status.  Sample request letter and instructions on how to locate a 
dietitian are contained online at
www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/support/21st_Century_Sailor/navynutrition/Pages/default2.aspx
under *CO Toolbox.*

4.  The dietitian will provide counseling (group or individual), work with 
the *fitness boss* and command fitness leaders to increase performance and 
readiness, collaborate with food service officers to reduce food cost and 
waste, increase overall productivity, and be an assisting provider to the 
medical department.

5.  A more in-depth list of all services offered by a dietitian are available 
online at www.public.navy.mil/bupers- 
npc/support/21st_Century_Sailor/navynutrition/Pages/default2.aspx.
