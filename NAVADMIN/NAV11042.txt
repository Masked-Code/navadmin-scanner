NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 041/11.  REF B IS NAVADMIN 411/10.//                  

1.  THIS IS THE THIRD IN A SERIES OF COMMUNICATIONS CONCERNING THE
REPEAL OF SECTION 654 OF TITLE 10, KNOWN AS "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL"
(DADT).  AS ANNOUNCED IN REF A, U.S. FLEET FORCES COMMAND (USFF) IS
THE EXECUTIVE AGENT FOR TRAINING DELIVERY AND TRACKING OF ALL NAVY PERSONNEL.  
USFF HAS ESTABLISHED THE DADT NAVY REPEAL IMPLEMENTATION
TASK FORCE (DNRI TF) TO DELIVER, ASSESS, AND DOCUMENT THE TRAINING OF
NAVY PERSONNEL.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS NAVADMIN IS TO OUTLINE
REQUIREMENTS FOR NAVY TRAINING PRIOR TO REPEAL CERTIFICATION, PROVIDE 
SPECIFIC DIRECTION FOR TRAINING COMPLETION AND DOCUMENTATION, AND
ASSIGN SUPPORTED/SUPPORTING RELATIONSHIPS.  IT SHOULD BE READ IN ITS 
ENTIRETY.

2.  AS SPECIFIED IN REF B, THE CURRENT DADT POLICY REMAINS IN EFFECT.
NO POLICIES, REGULATIONS, OR BENEFITS WILL CHANGE PRIOR TO FINAL
REPEAL.  FINAL REPEAL WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE UNTIL 60 DAYS AFTER THE 
PRESIDENT, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, AND CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS
CERTIFY TO CONGRESS THAT REPEAL CAN BE MADE IN A MANNER CONSISTENT
WITH THE STANDARDS OF MILITARY READINESS, MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,
UNIT COHESION, AND RECRUITING AND RETENTION OF THE ARMED FORCES.

3.  BACKGROUND.  THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS ACTIVELY PREPARING FOR 
REPEAL IMPLEMENTATION.  THE SERVICES ARE ENGAGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF IMPLEMENTING GUIDANCE FOR ALL SERVICE PERSONNEL.  ON 2 MARCH 2010,
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE DIRECTED THE HONORABLE JEH CHARLES JOHNSON, 
GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, AND GENERAL CARTER F.
HAM, COMMANDER, U.S. ARMY EUROPE, TO "STAND UP AN INTRA-DEPARTMENT, 
INTER-SERVICE WORKING GROUP TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE 
ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH A REPEAL OF THE DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL LAW."  
THE SECRETARY'S TERMS OF REFERENCE REQUIRED TWO DELIVERABLES:  1) A 
REPORT CONTAINING THE CO-CHAIRS' ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS; AND
2) A PLAN OF ACTION TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A REPEAL OF THE
LAW.  ON 22 DECEMBER 2010, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED INTO LAW LEGISLATION
THAT SET CONDITIONS FOR THE REPEAL OF DADT POLICY.  

4.  RESPONSIBILITIES.  DNRI TF WILL PLAN, DELIVER, ASSESS, AND
DOCUMENT DADT REPEAL TRAINING IN ORDER TO FACILITATE HIGHER LEVEL 
CERTIFICATION AND ENSURE THE NAVY FORCE IS EDUCATED ON NEW POLICIES
AND EXPECTATIONS OF CONDUCT.

5.  PURPOSE.  TO EDUCATE AND TRAIN NAVY PERSONNEL ON THE SPIRIT AND 
INTENT OF THE DADT REPEAL WITH NO IMPACT TO MISSION READINESS.

6.  METHOD.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE WILL BE PROVIDED TO ALL ACTIVE
AND RESERVE PERSONNEL, NAVY CIVILIANS WHO SUPERVISE MILITARY
PERSONNEL, AND DOD CONTRACTORS AS REQUIRED BY THEIR POSITION AND 
RESPONSIBILITIES.  TRAINING WILL BE PROVIDED VIA THREE METHODS USING
A TIERED APPROACH TO ENSURE PERSONNEL RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL
OF TRAINING.  THE CENTRAL MESSAGE OF THIS TRAINING WILL FOCUS ON 
LEADERSHIP, PROFESSIONALISM, DISCIPLINE, AND RESPECT.
    A.  LEADERSHIP.  THIS IS A MAJOR POLICY CHANGE AND FOCUSED
LEADERSHIP IS REQUIRED TO SET CONDITIONS FOR SUCCESS FOR UNIT
COHESION, READINESS, AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A GIVEN COMMAND.
FRONTLINE LEADERS ARE TASKED WITH BUILDING UNIT COHESION AND
MAINTAINING READINESS IN A DIVERSE FORCE TO MEET MISSION
REQUIREMENTS.  BY PROVIDING LEADERS AT ALL LEVELS WITH ACCURATE 
INFORMATION, WE ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO ENSURE A SMOOTH POLICY
TRANSITION WITH MINIMAL DISRUPTION TO THE FORCE.
    B.  PROFESSIONALISM.  WE HAVE TAKEN AN OATH AS MILITARY
PROFESSIONALS TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
STATES AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO OUR NAVY CORE VALUES.  EMPHASIZING
THESE PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATIONS IN A POST-REPEAL ENVIRONMENT WILL REINFORCE 
EXPECTATIONS OF PERSONAL BEHAVIOR AND WILL HELP REDUCE ANY IMPACT A POLICY 
CHANGE MAY HAVE ON OUR EFFECTIVENESS.
    C.  DISCIPLINE.  THE UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE (UCMJ) 
EMAINS THE LEGAL FOUNDATION OF GOOD ORDER AND DISCIPLINE.  THE UCMJ PROVIDES 
FOR ENFORCEMENT OF STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND LAWS AND
PROHIBITS HARASSMENT, SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND OTHER VIOLENCE.
ACCOUNTABILITY IS A CORNERSTONE OF GOOD ORDER AND DISCIPLINE AND
WILL CONTINUE TO GUIDE STANDARDS OF ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR. 
    D.  RESPECT.  AS LEADERS WE MUST FOCUS ON OUR VALUES AND NAVY TRADITIONS 
AS THE FOUNDATION FOR MAINTAINING THE STRENGTH OF OUR
FORCE.  CENTRAL TO THAT STRENGTH IS TREATING ALL PEOPLE WITH RESPECT
AND DIGNITY REGARDLESS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION.

7.  TRAINING LEVELS.  AS OUTLINED IN REF A, TRAINING WILL BE
CONDUCTED USING THE FOLLOWING TIER LEVELS:  
    A.  TIER 1 TRAINING WILL BE PROVIDED TO EXPERTS WHO MAY DEAL FREQUENTLY 
WITH REPEAL POLICY ISSUES (CHAPLAINS, JUDGE ADVOCATES,
SENIOR HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICERS, LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL, PUBLIC AFFAIRS 
OFFICERS, FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTER PERSONNEL,
PERSONNEL SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS, EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ADVISORS, AND RECRUITERS).  
COMMUNITY LEADERS OF THESE DISCIPLINES WILL DEVELOP
AND DELIVER THE REQUIRED TRAINING.  TIER 1 TRAINING WILL BE
DELINEATED VIA SEPARATE CORRESPONDENCE. 
    B.  TIER 2 TRAINING WILL BE PROVIDED TO COMMAND LEADERSHIP 
(EG., CO/XO/CMC/OIC/AOIC/SEA) AND WILL PREPARE THEM TO DELIVER POLICY 
INSTRUCTION AND EXPECTATIONS OF CONDUCT TO THEIR COMMANDS (TIER 3 TRAINING).
    C.  TIER 3 TRAINING IS INTENDED FOR ALL HANDS WHICH INCLUDES ALL ACTIVE 
AND RESERVE PERSONNEL, NAVY CIVILIANS WHO SUPERVISE MILITARY PERSONNEL, AND 
DOD CONTRACTORS, AS REQUIRED BY THEIR POSITIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES.  THIS 
GUIDANCE WILL EMPHASIZE POLICIES AND
EXPECTATIONS OF PERSONAL BEHAVIOR.

8.  DELIVERY.  USFF WILL LEAD DELIVERY OF THE REPEAL IMPLEMENTATION TRAINING 
TO ALL NAVY COMMANDS AND PERSONNEL.  THREE METHODS OF
DELIVERY WILL BE USED.
    A.  PRIMARY:  FACE-TO-FACE (F2F) DELIVERY.  MASTER MOBILE
TRAINING TEAMS (MMTT) COMPRISED OF FLEET REPRESENTATIVES WILL
DELIVER TIER 2 TRAINING.  THIS TRAINING IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR COMMAND 
LEADERSHIP TEAMS (CO/XO/CMC/OIC/AOIC/SEA) WHO, IN TURN, WILL PROVIDE ALL HANDS 
(TIER 3) TRAINING TO THEIR COMMANDS.
    B.  SECONDARY:  DEFENSE CONNECT ONLINE (DCO).  THIS OPTION WILL
BE USED TO REACH GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED SAILORS AND THOSE PERSONNEL ATTACHED 
TO NON-NAVY COMMANDS. 
    C.  TERTIARY:  E-SOLUTION.  A COMPUTER BASED TRAINING OPTION
WILL BE USED TO REACH THOSE PERSONNEL THAT CANNOT ATTEND F2F OR DCO TRAINING.
     D.  MASTER MOBILE TRAINING TEAMS (MMTT).  MMTT'S WILL RECEIVE TRAINING 
FROM THE CENTER FOR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CPPD).  THIS 
TRAINING 
WILL BE CONDUCTED AND CERTIFIED UNDER THE
GUIDANCE AND DIRECTION OF USFF.  JAG AND CHAPLAIN CORPS OFFICERS WILL PLAY 
CRITICAL ROLES IN TRAINING AND PREPARING THE MMTT'S FOR TRAVEL
TO GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS AROUND THE GLOBE.  MMTT'S WILL CONSIST OF
THREE PERSON TEAMS CONSISTING OF A URL POST-COMMAND O6, POST XO TOUR

9.  DOCUMENTATION.  COMPLETION OF TRAINING (TIER 1, 2, AND 3) WILL BE 
PRIMARILY DOCUMENTED VIA THE NAVY FAMILY ACCOUNTABILITY AND

PLANNING SYSTEM (FLTMPS).  NFAAS WILL BE UPDATED TO DOCUMENT
