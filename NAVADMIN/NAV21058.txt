3.  Each applicant should take pride in knowing that the superior performance 
documented in the evaluations reviewed by the board required the members to 
dedicate long hours in making hard choices to ensure only the best and fully 
qualified applicants were selected.  I am confident that each selectee will 
justify their selection time and again in their new career as naval officers. 
Those not selected are highly encouraged to seek out a LDO in your area for 
advice on ways to grow professionally and improve opportunity for future 
selection.  Bravo Zulu to all who were willing to answer the call. 
 
4.  This message is not authority to issue appointments.  Frocking is 
prohibited.  COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806) will deliver appointments to MyNavy 
Career Center (MNCC) Millington approximately 60 days prior to the 
commissioning date.  MNCC will forward appointments to the Transaction 
Service Center (TSC) Great Lakes, who will distribute directly to the 
respective CPPAs.  TSC Great Lakes will also process the conversion from 
enlisted to officer status for LDOs, for all commands other than those who 
have the ability to process their own (CVN, SPECWAR, etc.).  TSC Great Lakes 
can be contacted directly at the below email address. 
 
5.  Commanding Officers are directed to: 
    a.  Notify selectee. 
    b.  Notify PERS-803 via official correspondence not later than 10 days 
following release of this message of selectees who do not accept 
appointment.  Selectees who decline their commission within this 10 day 
period will be considered by the FY-22 Enlisted Selection Boards.  After the 
10 day period, PERS-802 will invalidate all FY-22 Active Duty Navy Nuclear 
LDO In-Service Procurement Selection Board selectees eligibility for the FY-
22 Active Duty Enlisted Selection Boards. 
    c.  Per reference (a), ensure LDO selectees obtain a commissioning 
physical within 90 days preceding the appointment month.  Notify the Nuclear 
LDO Detailer (PERS 422B) upon completion. 
    d.  Hold execution of all permanent change of station orders in abeyance, 
if applicable, and immediately notify PERS-40 of members selection. 
    e.  Administer official physical fitness assessment (PFA) within 4 months 
of commissioning date.  Selectees must hand carry test results to Officer 
Indoctrination School, Newport, RI.  If selectee fails to achieve 
satisfactory medium, notify the Nuclear LDO Detailer (PERS 422B).  Hold 
commissioning in abeyance until successful completion of PFA. 
    f.  Hold appointment in abeyance if it is determined that a selectee is 
no longer mentally, physically, morally or professional qualified or if they 
fail to meet current PFA requirements. Immediately forward documentation 
citing reason to PERS-803. 
 
6.  Nuclear LDO selectees who do not successfully complete a final technical 
interview will maintain their enlisted status and not be commissioned as 
LDOs.  Technical interviews will be scheduled by PERS-422B and selectees 
notified via separate correspondence. 
 
7.  If a LDO selectees enlistment (including any extensions) expires after 
the date of appointment, they are not reenlistment eligible unless 
appointment is declined. 
 
8.  Each selectee should contact the Nuclear LDO Detailer (PERS-422B) for 
submission requirements with regard to personal information and history cards 
and inform PERS-806 of address changes to facilitate appointment delivery.
