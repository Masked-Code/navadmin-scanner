AUGMENTATION (TFIA) UPDATE, PROVIDING NAVY IA BUSINESS 
RULES.// 
RMKS/1.  THIS IS THE FIRST OF TWO NAVADMINS UPDATING THE 
BUSINESS RULES ON INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION (IA) 
ASSIGNMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR 
(GWOT).  CURRENTLY, TWO SYSTEMS, THE LEGACY IA MANPOWER 
MANAGEMENT (IAMM) PROCESS AND THE GWOT SUPPORT 
ASSIGNMENT
(GSA) DETAILING PROCESS OPERATE IN PARALLEL TO MEET NAVY?S 
CONTINGENCY MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS PER REFS A AND B. THIS 
MESSAGE PROVIDES AN UPDATE TO THE IAMM PROCESS AND 
BUSINESS RULES CONTAINED IN REF C.  THE SECOND MESSAGE 
DESCRIBES THE BUSINESS RULES THAT GOVERN THE GSA DETAILING 
PROCESS, IMPLEMENTED IN SUMMER 2007, BY WHICH THE MAJORITY 
OF CURRENT AND FUTURE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE FILLED.  A 
FUTURE NAVADMIN WILL UPDATE SPECIFIC RESERVE COMPONENT 
GSA BUSINESS RULES.
2.  INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION MANPOWER MANAGEMENT 
BUSINESS RULES AND
DEFINITIONS:
    A.  CAPACITY/REDLINES: 
        (1) SEA-DUTY CAPACITY:  SEA-DUTY CAPACITY IS THE NUMBER 
OF SEA-DUTY PERSONNEL ABOVE A RISK-BASED REDLINE APPLIED 
BY UNIT IDENTIFICATION CODE (UIC), SKILL SET (RATING/DESIG), 
AND PAY BAND:
SUPERVISOR (E7-E9), JOURNEYMAN (E-5 & E6), APPRENTICE (E4 & 
BELOW) FOR ENLISTED.  REDLINES ARE CURRENTLY SET AT 90 
PERCENT OF P9 BILLETS AUTHORIZED (BA).  FOR ENLISTED 
PERSONNEL, REDLINES ARE CONSIDERED IN THE COMPUTATION OF 
AVAILABLE ASSETS IN THE CAPACITY MODEL.  USFF GFM IN 
COORDINATION WITH OPNAV N1 AND OPNAV N3/N5, MAY MODIFY 
REDLINES BY COMMUNITY AND/OR UIC (AS REQUIRED OR 
APPROPRIATE TO CHANGE CAPACITY).  REDLINES ARE A 
MANAGEMENT GUIDE AND DO NOT MEAN A SPECIFIC COMMAND/UNIT 
IDENTIFICATION CODE (UIC) WILL NOT BE TASKED TO PROVIDE AN 
IA IF FILLING THE REQUIREMENT WILL BRING THEM BELOW THE 
REDLINE BY UIC, SKILL SET OR PAY BAND.  THE MAJORITY OF HIGH 
DEMAND/LOW DENSITY (HD/LD) RATINGS AND DESIGNATORS ARE 
ALREADY BELOW CAPACITY AND ESTABLISHED REDLINES.  BUDGET 
SUBMITTING OFFICES
(BSOS) AND TYPE COMMANDERS (TYCOMS) ARE IN THE BEST 
POSITION TO DECIDE WHO TO SUB-TASK AND WILL CAREFULLY 
MANAGE IA REQUIREMENTS TO MINIMIZE READINESS IMPACT TO 
COMMANDS/UNITS.  CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM CAPACITY ARE:  
TYPE 3 AND 4 SEA DUTY; NUCLEAR TRAINED PERSONNEL ASSIGNED 
TO CVN, SSN, SSBN, SSGN; AND SPECIAL WARFARE (SPECWAR) 
ASSIGNED TO USSOCOM.  PERSONNEL EXCLUDED FROM CAPACITY 
MAY BE ASSIGNED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. 
        (2) SHORE-DUTY CAPACITY:  SHORE-DUTY CAPACITY IS THE 
NUMBER OF SHORE-DUTY PERSONNEL ABOVE A RISK-BASED REDLINE 
APPLIED BY UIC, SKILL SET (RATING/DESIG), AND PAY BAND:  
SUPERVISOR (E7-E9), JOURNEYMAN (E5 AND E6) AND APPRENTICE 
(E4 AND BELOW) FOR ENLISTED.
IN GENERAL, REDLINES ARE SET AT 75 PERCENT OF P9 BA FOR 
UNITS MANNED BY MISSION, FUNCTION AND TASK DOCUMENTS AND 
90 PERCENT OF P9 BA FOR UNITS MANNED BY FLEET MANNING 
DOCUMENTS.  FOR ENLISTED PERSONNEL, REDLINES ARE 
CONSIDERED IN THE COMPUTATION OF AVAILABLE ASSETS IN THE 
CAPACITY MODEL. USFF GFM, IN COORDINATION WITH OPNAV N1 
AND OPNAV N3/N5, MAY MODIFY REDLINES BY COMMUNITY AND/OR 
UIC (AS REQUIRED OR APPROPRIATE TO CHANGE CAPACITY).  
REDLINES ARE ONLY A MANAGEMENT GUIDE AND DO NOT MEAN A 
SPECIFIC COMMAND/UIC WILL NOT BE TASKED TO PROVIDE AN IA IF 
FILLING THE REQUIREMENT WILL BRING THEM BELOW THE REDLINE 
BY UIC, SKILL SET OR PAY BAND.  THE MAJORITY OF HIGH 
DEMAND/LOW DENSITY (HD/LD) RATINGS AND DESIGNATORS ARE 
ALREADY BELOW CAPACITY AND ESTABLISHED REDLINES.  
BSOS/TYCOMS ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO DECIDE WHO TO 
SUBTASK AND WILL CAREFULLY MANAGE THEIR IA REQUIREMENTS 
TO MINIMIZE READINESS IMPACT TO THEIR COMMANDS/UNITS.  
CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM CAPACITY ARE:  TYPE 6 OVERSEAS 
DUTY, JOINT DUTY, NON-DISTRIBUTABLE MANNING (STUDENTS, 
TRANSIENTS, TPPH), NUCLEAR WEAPONS (SECURITY, MAINTENANCE) 
BILLETS, NUCLEAR PROPULSION CODED BILLETS (AVAILABLE FOR 
ASSIGNMENT WITH OPNAV N133 APPROVAL), AND A PORTION OF 
MANPOWER, PERSONNEL, TRAINING AND EDUCATION (MPTE) 
READINESS BILLETS (E.G., CRITICAL INSTRUCTOR, RECRUIT 
DIVISION COMMANDER BILLETS, PRODUCTION RECRUITERS AND 
PRODUCTION SUPPORT (9612/9586)).  PERSONNEL EXCLUDED FROM 
CAPACITY MAY BE ASSIGNED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.
    B.  AC TASKING ALLOCATION:  THE GOAL IS TO BALANCE 
DISTRIBUTION OF REQUIREMENTS TO BSO/TYCOMS BASED ON SKILL 
SET, PAY BAND, AND TOUR LENGTH. 
        (1) DISTRIBUTION OF REQUIREMENTS WILL BE PROPORTIONAL 
TO THE BSO/TYCOM COMPONENT OF THE NET CAPACITY (NET 
BALANCE).  USFF WILL MANAGE REQUIREMENTS THROUGH THE 
BSOS/TYCOMS.  BSOS/TYCOMS WILL MANAGE THEIR SUB-CLAIMANTS 
IN THE SAME MANNER.
        (2) HD/LD COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT:  USFF WILL MANAGE 
AND TASK HD/LD COMMUNITIES (CURRENTLY SEABEE, NCW, FMF, 
NAVELSG, SPECWAR, BUMED, CEC, ED, SUPPLY, IP, INFORMATION 
WARFARE/CRYTPO, AND INTEL).
        (3) EXISTING REQUIREMENTS (REFILLS):  UPON RECEIVING 
TASKING TO REFILL AN EXISTING IA REQUIREMENT, BSOS/TYCOMS 
HAVE NO MORE THAN 30 DAYS TO PROVIDE THE NOMINEE TO USFF.
        (4) NEW REQUIREMENTS:  UPON RECEIVING TASKING FOR A 
NEW IA REQUIREMENT, BSOS/TYCOMS HAVE NO MORE THAN 14 
DAYS TO PROVIDE THE NOMINEE TO USFF.
        (5) EMERGENT REQUIREMENTS:  EMERGENT REQUIREMENTS 
ARE THOSE WHERE DELIVERY OF ORDERS TO THE SELECTED IA MAY 
BE LESS THAN 60 DAYS PRIOR TO THE FIRST INTERIM STOP REPORT 
DATE.  USFF WILL ASSIGN INDIVIDUALS AND NOTIFY THE 
APPLICABLE BSO/TYCOM OF THE SELECTIONS.
THE BSO/TYCOM MUST APPROVE THE NOMINATED INDIVIDUAL OR 
NOMINATE A DIFFERENT IA CANDIDATE WITHIN TWO BUSINESS 
DAYS OF SUCH A NOTIFICATION.
        (6) BSO/TYCOM SUB-TASKING PROCESS SHOULD ALLOW FOR 
MAXIMUM TIME TO IDENTIFY RIGHT FIT FOR FILL WHILE MEETING 
TASKING TIMELINES AND NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.
        (7) NOMINEE SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE ON THE DATE NOTED IN 
THE TASKING MESSAGE.  USFF MEASURES BSO/TYCOM 
RESPONSIVENESS TO DUE DATES IN ITS MONTHLY METRICS. 
        (8) ALL BY-NAME CALLS, VOLUNTEERS, OR OTHER SELECTIONS 
SHALL BE REFERRED TO THE BSO/TYCOM FOR CONCURRENCE.  IF A 
BY-NAME FILL IS NOT AGREED UPON, THE BSO/TYCOM IS STILL 
REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE REQUIREMENT AND SHALL NOMINATE A 
REPLACEMENT.  IF THE BSO/TYCOM DOES NOT HAVE OTHER 
QUALIFIED CANDIDATES, ADVISE USFF VIA THE RECLAMA PROCESS, 
AND THE REQUIREMENT WILL BE RETASKED IF APPROPRIATE.
        (9) THE SKILL SET STATED IN THE TASKING MESSAGE 
REPRESENTS THE DEMAND SIGNAL OF THE COMBATANT COMMANDER 
AND SHOULD BE FILLED AS TASKED.  USFF WILL MAKE EVERY 
EFFORT TO PROVIDE ALL AVAILABLE REQUIREMENT INFORMATION IN 
THE TASKING MESSAGE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE TASKING MESSAGE 
WILL PROVIDE ALTERNATE RATINGS/DESIGNATORS THAT MAY FILL A 
REQUIREMENT WHEN SUITABLE SUBSTITUTION INFORMATION IS 
AVAILABLE.  USFF RECOGNIZES THAT REQUESTS TO WAIVE THE 
STATED REQUIREMENT MAY BE NECESSARY IN SOME CASES.  TO 
ENSURE MISSION AND SAILOR SUCCESS, WAIVERS NORMALLY 
REQUIRE APPROVAL FROM IN-THEATER COMMANDERS AND TAKE 
TIME TO PROCESS.  BSOS/TYCOMS ARE DIRECTED TO MINIMIZE 
THESE WAIVERS TO NO MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR TOTAL
TASKINGS FOR THE MONTH.   
        (10) SWAPS.  USFF ROUTINELY RECEIVES REQUESTS TO SWAP 
NOMINATIONS.  SWAPS CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REWORK AND REDUCE 
SAILOR NOTIFICATION TIME.  REQUESTS TO CHANGE 
PRIMARY/ALTERNATE NOMINATIONS ARE CLOSELY EVALUATED AND 
WILL BE GIVEN CONSIDERATION IN EMERGENCY OR SEVERE 
HARDSHIP CASES.  SWAPS FOR CONVENIENCE OF A COMMAND OR 
SAILOR WILL GENERALLY NOT BE APPROVED.
        (11) RECLAMA TO IA TASKING.  IF BSOS/TYCOMS CONSIDER A 
RECLAMA APPROPRIATE, SUBMIT RECLAMA TO USFF WITHIN 10 
BUSINESS DAYS OF RECEIPT OF TASKING MESSAGE.  RECLAMA SHALL 
INCLUDE DETAILED JUSTIFICATION REGARDING INABILITY TO 
SUPPORT.  INCLUDE STATEMENT REGARDING MISSION/OPERATIONAL 
READINESS IMPACT AND IDENTIFY ANY POTENTIAL DEGRADATION 
OF SERVICES IF REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE IA REQUIREMENT.  AS 
PART OF THE RECLAMA PROCESS, USFF MAY REQUEST BSO/ TYCOM 
PROVIDE A NAME-BY-NAME LIST OF ALL QUALIFIED CANDIDATES 
EXPLAINING THE REASON EACH MEMBER CANNOT SUPPORT THE IA.  
    C.  NOTIFICATION TIME:  THE STANDARD IS 60 DAYS 
NOTIFICATION. 
HOWEVER, OPERATIONAL NEED MAY RESULT IN SOME SAILORS 
RECEIVING LESS THAN 60 DAYS NOTIFICATION. 
        (1) BSOS/TYCOMS SHALL CERTIFY IN THEIR SUBMISSION TO 
USFF THAT PRIMARY AND ALTERNATES (BOTH NON-EMBEDDED AND 
EMBEDDED) HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THEIR SELECTION AND SHALL 
ENSURE NOMINEES BEGIN PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLISTS AND 
PROCESSING. 
        (2) BSOS/TYCOMS WHICH SOLICIT VOLUNTEERS AND/OR IA 
CANDIDATES FROM MULTIPLE ISIC/COMMANDS ARE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR ENSURING CANDIDATES NOT CHOSEN RECEIVE TIMELY AND 
OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION FROM THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.
        (3) DATE OF NOTIFICATION IS OFFICIALLY MEASURED FROM 
THE DATE OF ORDERS ISSUANCE:  90-DAY NOTIFICATION IS THE 
BENCHMARK; 60-DAY NOTIFICATION IS THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT.
        (4) IF IN DANGER OF BROACHING THE 60-DAY NOTIFICATION 
LIMIT, AT THE 70 DAY POINT BSOS OR TYCOMS WILL ASSIGN THE 
BILLET TO AN INDIVIDUAL AND WILL GIVE THE CHAIN OF COMMAND 
TWO BUSINESS DAYS TO ACCEPT OR PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE.  
        (5) 60-DAY WAIVERS WILL ONLY BE CONSIDERED IF THERE 
WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT READINESS IMPACT ON THE MISSION, NOT 
SOLELY ON THE BASIS THAT A SAILOR IS WILLING TO REPORT LESS 
THAN 60 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THE ORDERS.  CHIEF OF NAVAL 
PERSONNEL WILL BE INFORMED OF ANY NOTIFICATION LESS THAN 
30 DAYS.
    D.  IA CANDIDATE BUSINESS RULES:
        (1) LEGACY IA ELIGIBLE SAILORS ARE THOSE SAILORS 
OUTSIDE THE GSA ASSIGNMENT RULES WHO HAVE GREATER THAN 
12 MONTHS REMAINING ON THEIR SEA OR SHORE TOUR AND HAVE 
BEEN IN HOMEPORT FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS.  VOLUNTEERS 
SHALL BE GIVEN FIRST PRIORITY FOR IA ASSIGNMENT.
        (2) SECOND TOUR IA:  BSOS/TYCOMS SHALL NOT SUBMIT A 
NOMINEE WHO HAS COMPLETED A PREVIOUS IA TOUR.  SUBMIT 
WAIVERS TO THIS POLICY TO USFF.  USFF WILL CONSIDER WAIVERS 
ONLY IF THE MEMBER IS A VOLUNTEER AND NO OTHER CANDIDATES 
ARE AVAILABLE AND DEPLOYABLE WITHIN THE BSO/TYCOM AOR.
        (3) PERSTEMPO/ITEMPO/DWELL TIME:  IAS WILL BE AFFORDED 
THE APPROPRIATE REPRIEVE BETWEEN DEPLOYMENTS.  EACH 
NOMINEE SHALL BE REVIEWED TO ENSURE THE MEMBER DID NOT 
RECENTLY RETURN FROM A DEPLOYMENT OR WILL NOT FACE A 
DEPLOYMENT AFTER THE IA.  OPNAVINST 3000.13C CONTAINS 
POLICY REGARDING DWELL TIME AND SHALL BE APPLIED TO IA 
DEPLOYMENTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, A SAILOR WHO COMPLETED A SIX 
MONTH DEPLOYMENT SHOULD NOT FILL AN IA REQUIREMENT UNTIL 
SIX MONTHS AFTER THE DEPLOYMENT.  COMMANDS ARE REQUIRED 
TO DOCUMENT IA DEPLOYMENTS AS ITEMPO EVENTS.  WHEN THERE 
IS NO OTHER VIABLE ALTERNATIVE THAN TO SELECT A MEMBER 
WHOSE GWOT DEPLOYMENT WOULD VIOLATE DWELL OR ITEMPO 
REQUIREMENTS, REFER THE CASE TO USFF FOR WAIVER 
CONSIDERATION.
        (4) PRD MANAGEMENT:  PERSONNEL IN THEIR NORMAL 
DETAILING NEGOTIATION WINDOW (I.E., WITHIN NINE MONTHS OF 
PRD) OR WHO ARE CURRENTLY UNDER ORDERS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE 
TO FILL IA REQUIREMENTS VIA THE IAMM PROCESS.  IF REQUIRED, 
PRDS FOR PERSONNEL SELECTED FOR AN IA TOUR WILL BE 
ADJUSTED TO THE END OF THE MONTH FOLLOWING THE PROJECTED 
MONTH OF RETURN.
            (A) FOR ENLISTED PERSONNEL, USFF SHALL INITIATE A PRD 
CHANGE REQUEST TO SUPPORT THE IA. 
            (B) FOR OFFICER PERSONNEL, PARENT COMMANDS SHALL 
INITIATE A PRD CHANGE WITH THE OFFICER?S DETAILER CITING 
THE REASON:  PRD CHANGE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT NAVY GWOT 
EFFORTS AS DIRECTED BY HIGHER AUTHORITY.
        (5) EAOS MANAGEMENT:  WE EXPECT SAILORS TO GO 
FORWARD IN SUPPORT OF GWOT OPERATIONS.  PERSONNEL 
SELECTED FOR AN IA MUST HAVE AN EAOS BEYOND THE END OF THE 
MONTH FOLLOWING THE PROJECTED MONTH OF RETURN FROM THE 
IA.  IF REQUIRED, PERSONNEL SHOULD EXTEND OR REENLIST AS 
APPROPRIATE TO ENSURE THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT OBLIGATED 
SERVICE.
DETAILERS/BUPERS-32 WILL CONSIDER HIGH-YEAR TENURE 
WAIVERS ON A CASE- BY CASE BASIS.
        (6) E-1/E-2 SAILORS SHALL ONLY BE ACCEPTED FOR IA 
ASSIGNMENTS THAT ARE PART OF A PREDOMINATELY NAVY UNIT 
WITH AN IDENTIFIED NAVY COMMAND STRUCTURE.
        (7) RETIREMENT/RESIGNATION:  IF A MEMBER SUBMITS A 
RETIREMENT REQUEST OR RESIGNATION FOLLOWING VERBAL 
NOTIFICATION OF AN ASSIGNMENT BUT PRIOR TO ORDERS 
ISSUANCE, THE CHAIN OF COMMAND SHALL INDICATE THIS ACTION 
ON THE REQUEST.  RETIREMENT REQUESTS THAT WOULD PRECLUDE 
COMPLETION OF THE ASSIGNMENT WILL NOT NORMALLY BE 
ACCEPTED.
        (8) PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT:  DETAILERS, COMMUNITY 
MANAGERS AND PARENT COMMANDS, IN COORDINATION WITH 
BSOS/TYCOMS, ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO MANAGE A SAILOR?S 
INDIVIDUAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND CAREER 
MILESTONES AND SHALL COLLABORATE TO MINIMIZE NEGATIVE 
IMPACT TO AN INDIVIDUAL SAILOR.
        (9) VOLUNTEERS:  ALL VOLUNTEERS FROM COMMANDS NOT 
INCLUDED IN CAPACITY REQUIRE COMMAND ENDORSEMENT.  
NUCLEAR CODED SHORE BILLETS REQUIRE OPNAV N133 
CONCURRENCE PRIOR TO ASSIGNMENT.
        (10) EXCLUSIONS:  PERSONNEL WITHIN HD/LD SKILL SET 
UNITS MAY NOT BE USED TO FILL A REQUIREMENT OUTSIDE THEIR 
SKILL SET AND ARE EXCLUDED FROM ANY PETTY OFFICER OR 1050 
OFFICER IA ASSIGNMENTS.
    E.  ORDERS.
        (1) NAVY MOBILIZATION AND PROCESSING SITES (NMPS): 
COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4G4) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NMPS LEVEL 
LOADING AND NAVY INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE COMBAT TRAINING 
(NIACT)  QUOTA CONTROL. LEVEL LOADING IS PROJECTED WELL IN 
ADVANCE AND IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE CAPACITY IS NOT 
EXCEEDED.  NMPS SITES LISTED ON MEMBER?S ORDERS ARE THE 
APPROVED LOCATION. REQUESTS FOR PROCESSING THROUGH 
ALTERNATE NMPS SITES WILL
NORMALLY BE DENIED.   
        (2) CHANGES TO ORDERS:  ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL RECEIVES 
ORDERS, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THOSE ORDERS (GREATER THAN 
30-DAY IMPACT ON DEPARTURE FROM AND RETURN TO PARENT UNIT) 
SHALL BE HANDLED AS FOLLOWS:
            (A) IF A BILLET IS CANCELLED LESS THAN 60 DAYS FROM 
FIRST INTERIM STOP, THE MEMBER WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO BE 
ASSIGNED TO ANOTHER BILLET (PROVIDED ONE IS AVAILABLE 
WITHIN RANK AND SKILL-SET MATCH). 
THE MEMBER?S BSO/TYCOM SHALL IDENTIFY A NEW BILLET 
ASSIGNMENT, EITHER WORKING FROM THE BILLETS TASKED TO THE 
BSO/TYCOM OR BY COORDINATING WITH USFF TO CHOOSE FROM 
ALL OPEN BILLETS.
            (B) IF A BILLET IS CANCELLED GREATER THAN 60 DAYS 
FROM FIRST INTERIM STOP, THE MEMBER WILL NOT HAVE THE 
OPTION TO SEEK AUTOMATIC REASSIGNMENT BUT MAY VOLUNTEER 
FOR A FUTURE ASSIGNMENT WITH A COMMAND ENDORSEMENT.
            (C) INCREASES TO BILLET TOUR LENGTHS RESULTING FROM 
A BILLET REVALIDATION SHALL BE REFLECTED IN SUBSEQUENT 
ROTATIONS OF THE BILLET.  UNLESS EXTENSION IS DIRECTED BY 
SECDEF, ASSIGNED IA TOUR COMPLETION DATES WILL NOT BE 
ADJUSTED.  USFF SHALL PROCESS CHANGES TO TOUR LENGTH IN 
ORDERS AND WILL ADVISE BSO/TYCOM. BSO/TYCOM SHALL KEEP 
THE IA?S PARENT COMMAND APPRISED OF ALL ORDER 
MODIFICATIONS.
            (D) IF A BILLET IS CANCELLED AFTER THE MEMBER HAS 
REPORTED FOR OR COMPLETED TRAINING, USFF SHALL EVALUATE 
OPTIONS FOR REASSIGNMENT TO ANOTHER LIKE REQUIREMENT.  
THE BSO/TYCOM SHALL BE NOTIFIED OF USFF?S DECISION TO 
EITHER REASSIGN MEMBER TO ANOTHER LINE NUMBER OR RETURN 
MEMBER TO PARENT COMMAND.  USFF SHALL GAIN BSO/TYCOM 
CONCURRENCE IF THE REASSIGNED LINE NUMBER WILL RESULT IN A 
LATER RETURN DATE OF THE SAILOR. 
    F.  IA BUSINESS RULES ON ALTERNATES:  HISTORICAL DATA 
REVEALS THAT FALLOUT RATES CONTINUE TO REMAIN 
APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT DESPITE INCREASED AWARENESS OF 
SCREENING REQUIREMENTS FOR IAS. 
ALTERNATE DEFINITIONS: 
        (1) ALTERNATES ARE NOT REQUIRED FOR O5/O6 
REQUIREMENTS.
        (2) NON-EMBEDDED ALTERNATE:  AN ALTERNATE TO THE 
PRIMARY CANDIDATE WHO IS A BACK-UP TO DEPLOY IN PLACE OF 
THE PRIMARY IF REQUIRED.  NON-EMBEDDED ALTERNATES ARE NOT 
ASSIGNED TO A SEPARATE LINE NUMBER FROM THE PRIMARY AND 
DO NOT RECEIVE TRAINING IN PARALLEL WITH THE PRIMARY. 
            (A) SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR NON-EMBEDDED ALTERNATES:  
NON- EMBEDDED ALTERNATES WILL BE USED FOR IA REQUIREMENTS 
THAT REQUIRE THE STANDARD TRAINING PACKAGE OF NMPS AND 
NIACT.  BSOS/TYCOMS SHALL IDENTIFY TWO NOMINEES FOR EACH 
REQUIREMENT LINE NUMBER.  BSOS/TYCOMS ARE PERMITTED TO 
USE THEIR OWN MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES TO IDENTIFY AND 
MANAGE THEIR NON-EMBEDDED ALTERNATES.  IF BSOS/TYCOMS 
CHOOSE TO MANAGE THEIR OWN NON-EMBEDDED ALTERNATES, 
USFF SHALL REQUIRE THAT A REPLACEMENT NOMINEE BE 
SUBMITTED WITHIN ONE WORKING DAY OF NOTIFICATION THAT 
THE PRIMARY HAS DROPPED.  NON-EMBEDDED ALTERNATE 
NOMINEES SHALL NOT BE UTILIZED FOR OTHER LINE NUMBERS 
UNTIL THE PRIMARY HAS DEPLOYED TO THEATER. 
            (B) NON-EMBEDDED ALTERNATES PREPARATION:  NON-
EMBEDDED ALTERNATES SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE LIKELY 
PROBABILITY THAT THEY WILL DEPLOY TO THEATER.  MEMBERS 
IDENTIFIED AS NON-EMBEDDED ALTERNATES MUST TAKE ACTIONS 
TO ENSURE THEY ARE FULLY READY TO DEPLOY ON THE SCHEDULED 
DEPLOY DATE.  HOWEVER, NON-EMBEDDED ALTERNATES SHALL NOT 
MAKE ANY IRREVERSIBLE DECISIONS SUCH AS RELOCATING A 
FAMILY MEMBER OR TERMINATING A LEASE UNTIL OFFICIAL IA 
ORDERS ARE RECEIVED. 
            (C) NON-EMBEDDED ALTERNATE ACTIVATION:  IF THE 
PRIMARY NOMINEE IS NO LONGER QUALIFIED TO FULFILL THE IA, 
USFF SHALL NOTIFY THE BSO/TYCOM THAT THE NON-EMBEDDED 
ALTERNATE WILL BE ELEVATED TO PRIMARY.  ORDERS WILL BE 
ISSUED TO THE NON-EMBEDDED ALTERNATE TO PROVIDE AT LEAST 
30 DAYS NOTIFICATION.  IF ORDERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
PROCESSED FOR THE ORIGINAL PRIMARY, USFF WILL REQUEST 
CANCELLATION ORDERS FOR THE ORIGINAL NOMINEE.  
        (3) EMBEDDED ALTERNATES:  EMBEDDED ALTERNATES ARE 
ASSIGNED TO A PECIFIC LINE NUMBER AND WILL ATTEND TRAINING 
IN PARALLEL WITH THE OTHER PERSONNEL ASSIGNED TO THE 
MISSION.
            (A) SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR EMBEDDED ALTERNATES: 
EMBEDDED ALTERNATES WILL BE USED FOR IA REQUIREMENTS WITH 
A LONGER AND MORE SPECIALIZED TRAINING PACKAGE.  EMBEDDED 
ALTERNATES WILL BE ASSIGNED TO THEIR OWN LINE NUMBER AND 
WILL RECEIVE ORDERS TO ATTEND THE TRAINING WITH OTHER 
PERSONNEL IN THAT MISSION.  EMBEDDED ALTERNATES SHALL NOT 
BE NOMINATED FOR OTHER MISSIONS UNTIL AFTER THE PRIMARY 
HAS COMPLETED AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL MISSION 
DURATION, UNLESS APPROVED BY USFF. 
            (B) EMBEDDED ALTERNATE PREPARATION:  EMBEDDED 
ALTERNATES SHOULD BE BRIEFED OF THE HIGH PROBABILITY THAT 
THEY WILL DEPLOY TO THEATER.  SAILORS IDENTIFIED AS 
EMBEDDED ALTERNATES MUST TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THEY 
CONTINUE TO REMAIN READY TO DEPLOY DURING THE FIRST 50 
PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL MISSION PERIOD.  HOWEVER, 
EMBEDDED ALTERNATES SHALL NOT MAKE ANY IRREVERSIBLE 
DECISIONS SUCH AS RELOCATING A FAMILY MEMBER OR 
TERMINATING A LEASE UNTIL OFFICIALLY NOTIFIED THAT THEY 
WILL BE REQUIRED TO GO FORWARD TO SUPPORT THE MISSION.  
            (C) EMBEDDED ALTERNATE ACTIVATION:  THE MISSION 
COMMANDER SHALL ADVISE EMBEDDED ALTERNATES EITHER DURING 
TRAINING OR ONCE TRAINING IS COMPLETE IF THEY WILL GO 
FORWARD WITH THE REST OF THE PRIMARY MISSION PERSONNEL, 
WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF USFF.  IF THE EMBEDDED ALTERNATE 
DOES NOT INITIALLY GO FORWARD, THEY WILL BE RETURNED TO 
THEIR PARENT COMMAND AND CONSIDERED ON STAND-BY TO JOIN 
THE MISSION FOR 50 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL MISSION 
DURATION.  IF A DECISION IS MADE TO ACTIVATE AN EMBEDDED 
ALTERNATE AFTER THE MISSION ARRIVES IN THEATER, USFF WILL 
NOTIFY THE BSO/TYCOM THAT MEMBER IS REQUIRED TO REPORT IN 
SUPPORT OF THE MISSION.  NEW ORDERS WILL BE ISSUED WITH A 
REPORT DATE THAT PROVIDES AT LEAST 14 DAYS ADDITIONAL 
PREPARATION TIME.
        (4) BOTH NON-EMBEDDED AND EMBEDDED ALTERNATES 
SHOULD BE MEDICALLY QUALIFIED AND READY TO DEPLOY WITH 
THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE, LEGAL AND PERSONAL AFFAIRS IN ORDER.  
BSOS/TYCOMS ARE DIRECTED TO ENSURE PARENT COMMANDS 
CONDUCT A THOROUGH SCREENING OF BOTH PRIMARY AND 
ALTERNATE IAS. 
THE EXPEDITIONARY COMBAT READINESS CENTER (ECRC) IA 
CHECKLIST WILL ASSIST PARENT COMMANDS IN IDENTIFYING ANY 
DISQUALIFYING ITEMS WITH A NOMINEE. 
THIS CHECKLIST IS A REQUIRED ACTION FOR ALL IAS, PRIMARY AND 
ALTERNATES (BOTH NON-EMBEDDED AND EMBEDDED), AND SHALL 
BE E-MAILED TO ECRC PER INSTRUCTIONS ON THE NKO WEB SITE.  
ADDITIONALLY, MANDATORY NKO COURSES ARE REQUIRED FOR 
BOTH PRIMARY AND ALTERNATE CANDIDATES.  COMPLETION OF 
THESE PREPARATORY ACTIONS WILL HELP REDUCE FALLOUTS.
3.  WHILE EVERY EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO EXECUTE GSA AND IAMM 
BUSINESS RULES AS PUBLISHED IN NAVADMINS, THERE WILL BE 
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH CANNOT BE ANTICIPATED.  THE NAVY IS 
COMMITTED TO FINDING THE BEST BALANCE BETWEEN THE IA 
MISSION, NEEDS/DESIRES OF THE SAILOR, AND COMMAND 
READINESS. UNANTICIPATED DEMANDS MAY REQUIRE TAILORED 
SOLUTIONS NOT COVERED IN THESE BUSINESS RULES.
4.  YOUR EFFORTS TO DATE HAVE BEEN CRUCIAL TO ENSURING 
NAVY PROVIDES THE RIGHT SAILOR WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS AT THE 
RIGHT TIME TO MEET OUR NATION?S GWOT SUPPORT 
REQUIREMENTS.  WE VALUE YOUR INPUT AS WE WORK TO IMPROVE 
THE PROCESS AND PROVIDE SAILORS, FAMILIES AND COMMANDS 
THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE TIME TO PREPARE FOR THIS CRITICAL 
MISSION.
