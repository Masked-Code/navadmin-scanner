RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES EXTENSION OF THE NAVY'S CAREER 
INTERMISSION PILOT PROGRAM (CIPP) AND ASSOCIATED APPLICATION 
GUIDELINES.  REF A AUTHORIZED THE SECRETARIES OF MILITARY DEPARTMENTS 
TO IMPLEMENT CIPP TO DETERMINE IF RETENTION IN CRITICAL SKILL SETS 
CAN BE ENHANCED BY PERMITTING TEMPORARY INACTIVATION FROM ACTIVE DUTY 
AND PROVIDING GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN CAREER PATHS OF SERVICE MEMBERS.  
THIS PROGRAM IS LIMITED BY LAW TO THE SELECTION OF 20 OFFICERS AND 20 
ENLISTED PARTICIPANTS PER YEAR FROM 2009 THROUGH 2012.  REF B EXTENDS 
PROGRAM AUTHORITY THROUGH 2015.

2.  CIPP PROVIDES A ONE-TIME TEMPORARY TRANSITION FROM ACTIVE DUTY TO 
THE INDIVIDUAL READY RESERVE (IRR) FOR A PERIOD OF ONE TO THREE YEARS 
FOR SERVICE MEMBERS TO PURSUE PERSONAL OR PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATIONS 
OUTSIDE THE NAVY, WHILE PROVIDING A MEANS FOR THEIR SEAMLESS RETURN 
TO ACTIVE DUTY.  THE LONG-TERM INTENT OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO RETAIN 
VALUABLE EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING OF SERVICE MEMBERS, WHICH MIGHT 
OTHERWISE BE LOST DUE TO PERMANENT SEPARATION.  EXAMPLES OF 
PARTICIPANTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:  
    A.  SERVICE MEMBERS DESIRING TO START A FAMILY. 
    B.  SERVICE MEMBERS WITH CRITICAL ELDER CARE OBLIGATIONS.      
    C.  SERVICE MEMBERS VOLUNTEERING FOR INTERNATIONAL AID WORK.

3.  DURING THE PERIOD OF INACTIVE DUTY IN THE IRR, THE MEMBER IS 
PROVIDED FULL ACTIVE DUTY TRICARE HEALTH BENEFITS FOR THEMSELVES AND 
THEIR DEPENDENTS, A MONTHLY STIPEND OF 2 TIMES 1/30TH OF THEIR BASIC 
PAY, AND A ONE-TIME MOVE TO A CONUS LOCATION OF THEIR CHOICE FOR THE 
DURATION OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE PILOT PROGRAM.  ALL PROGRAM 
PARTICIPANTS WILL RETURN TO ACTIVE DUTY AT THE END OF THE PERIOD
PRESCRIBED AND WILL INCUR A TWO-MONTH FOR EVERY ONE-MONTH OF PROGRAM 
PARTICIPATION OBLIGATED SERVICE (OBLISERVE) IN ADDITION TO ANY 
EXISTING OBLISERVE OWED TO THE NAVY.  FOR EXAMPLE, A MEMBER WHO 
ELECTS PARTICIPATION FOR ONE-YEAR WILL INCUR A TWO-YEAR OBLISERVE.  
MAXIMUM CIPP PARTICIPATION IS THREE YEARS FOR A CORRESPONDING 
SIX-YEAR OBLISERVE.

4.  PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS' TIME IN THE IRR WILL NOT COUNT TOWARDS 
ELIGIBILITY FOR RETIREMENT, COMPUTATION OF RETIRED OR RETAINER PAY, 
COMPUTATION OF TOTAL YEARS OF COMMISSIONED SERVICE, OR HIGH YEAR 
TENURE (HYT) LIMITATIONS.  AS SUCH, THE MEMBER WILL BE EXEMPT FROM 
PROMOTION CONSIDERATIONS DURING PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AND WILL 
RETURN TO ACTIVE DUTY IN THE SAME GRADE AND TIME-IN-GRADE LAST HELD 
ON ACTIVE DUTY.  OFFICERS WILL HAVE THEIR DATE OF RANK (DOR) 
ADJUSTED TO A LATER DATE AND ENLISTED MEMBERS WILL BE ELIGIBLE BY 
REASON OF TIME IN GRADE FOR PROMOTION, TO INCLUDE ACTIVE DUTY 
SERVICE DATE (ADSD) RECALCULATION.

5.  INTERESTED PERSONNEL SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW REF C FOR A FULL 
OVERVIEW OF CIPP GUIDELINES, ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS, AND 
APPLICATION CRITERIA.  APPLICATIONS ARE CURRENTLY BEING ACCEPTED ON 
A ROLLING BASIS AND MUST BE SUBMITTED IN STANDARD NAVY LETTER 
FORMAT TO OPNAV (N134), VIA THE APPLICANT'S COMMANDING OFFICER.

6.  CIPP PRESENTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST AN ALTERNATIVE 
RETENTION TOOL AND SUPPORT SERVICE MEMBER'S DESIRE TO TAKE A CAREER 
"OFF RAMP" WITHOUT PENALTY AND RETURN TO ACTIVE DUTY TO COMPLETE A 
SUCCESSFUL NAVY CAREER.  QUESTIONS REGARDING PROGRAM GUIDELINES AND 
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA MAY BE DIRECTED TO THE PROGRAM MANAGER LISTED
