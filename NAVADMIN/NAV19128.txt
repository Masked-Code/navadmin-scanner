RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces off-ramp guidance for Active Component 
Submarine Communications Designator (6290) Limited Duty Officers (LDO) to the 
Information Professional (IP) designator (1820) unrestricted line.
    a.  After two consecutive tours (4-6 years commissioned service), 
Submarine Communications (6290) LDOs will be eligible for redesignation to IP 
(1820) without board action.  Reference (a), paragraph 4 provides detailed 
application procedures.
    b.  Beginning fiscal year 2020 (1 October 2019) approximately 38 
submarine communications (6290) billets, lieutenant through captain, will be 
shifted to the IP (1820) designator.  Current submarine communications (6290) 
LDOs may continue to compete for promotion in the nuclear and submarine 
competitive category, even though there will be zero control grade billets.
    c.  Reference (b) has been updated to include the additional 
qualification designator (AQD) IP officers qualified in submarine 
communications (SV3).
    d.  This NAVADMIN updates reference (c), adding the IP (1820) designator 
with AQD SV3 to the list of active-duty officers eligible for continuous 
submarine pay.  Current submarine communications
(6290) LDOs redesignated to IP (1820) will be paid following current 
guidelines for the submarine communications (6290) designator.
Reference (c) is currently under revision and will contain this update upon 
release.

3.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
