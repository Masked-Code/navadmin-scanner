SUBJ/RATING ENTRY FOR GENERAL APPRENTICES (REGA)// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES UPDATED RATING ENTRY FOR GENERAL 
APPRENTICE (REGA) LEVELS.  REGA IS A TOOL THAT PROVIDES THE MOST UP- 
TO-DATE INFORMATION FOR NON-DESIGNATED SAILORS TO LEARN ABOUT 
REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTRY INTO SPECIFIC RATINGS. JOINING A NEW COMMUNITY 
IS A MILESTONE FOR OUR JUNIOR SAILORS, AND KEEPING SAILORS INFORMED OF 
THEIR CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IS THE JOB OF ALL MEMBERS OF THEIR CHAIN OF 
COMMAND. THIS MESSAGE, USED WITH INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOUR 
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TEAM, WILL ALLOW LEADERS TO HELP OUR MOST 
JUNIOR SAILORS TAKE BETTER CONTROL OF THEIR CAREERS.
2.  TO EXECUTE A SUCCESSFUL CAREER STRATEGY FOR OUR NON-DESIGNATED 
SAILORS, COMMANDS SHOULD USE THE FLEET RATING IDENTIFICATION ENGINE 
(FLEET RIDE) AT HTTPS://FLEETRIDE.SPAWARITC.NAVY.MIL TO VALIDATE 
QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE DESIRED RATING.  IT IS CRITICAL THAT COUNSELORS 
COMPLY WITH REGA REQUIREMENTS AND PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) POLICIES 
AVAILABLE IN FLEET RIDE WHILE DETERMINING BEST CAREER OPTIONS WITH THE 
SAILOR.
      BASIC PERSONNEL DATA FOR ALL GENDETS HAS BEEN PRE-POPULATED INTO 
FLEET RIDE AND SHOULD BE VERIFIED FOR ACCURACY.  THIS INFORMATION 
INCLUDES SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (SSN), NAME, RATE, ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE 
DATE (ADSD), GENDER AND THE MOST RECENT ARMED FORCES VOCATIONAL 
APTITUDE BATTERY (ASVAB)/ARMED FORCES QUALIFICATION TEST (AFQT) DATA AS 
REFLECTED IN THE ENLISTED MASTER FILE.  ADDITIONALLY, OTHER UNIQUE 
QUALIFICATIONS FOR RATING ENTRY (E.G., MEDICAL, LEGAL, CITIZENSHIP AND 
SECURITY CLEARANCE ELIGIBILITY, ETC.) SHOULD BE VERIFIED AND ENTERED 
PRIOR TO RATING ELIGIBILITY SCREENING.  COMMAND REPRESENTATIVES WILL 
USE THIS DATA TO CONDUCT CAREER DEVELOPMENT BOARDS (CDB) FOR ALL NON-
DESIGNATED SAILORS TO GUIDE THEM INTO A RATING THAT WILL PROVIDE 
FAVORABLE CAREER PROGRESSION.  POC FOR ACCESS TO FLEET RIDE IS MR. PAUL 
MARTIN AT (901) 874-2970/DSN 882 OR EMAIL: PAUL.D.MARTIN(AT)NAVY.MIL.
3.  FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS. WE ARE ON TRACK TO COMPLETE THE TRANSITION 
FROM THE GENDET TO THE PACT (PROFESSIONAL APPRENTICESHIP CAREER
TRACK) PROGRAM IN LATE 2007. NAVADMIN 267/05 DETAILED OUR TRANSITION 
PLAN TO THE PACT PROGRAM, INCLUDING MILESTONES AND PROCEDURES FOR 
CURRENT AN AND SN GENDET SAILORS TO SELECT AND OBTAIN RATINGS.
PLEASE FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THAT NAVADMIN AS YOU_LL BE SEEING MORE 
ABOUT THE PACT PROGRAM SOON.
4.  THIS PARAGRAPH LISTS EACH RATING AND THE PROCEDURES FOR NON- 
DESIGNATED SAILORS TO ENTER THAT RATING VIA EXAMINATION, IF AUTHORIZED. 
COMMAND LEADERSHIP SHOULD UTILIZE THIS INFORMATION TO PROPERLY COUNSEL 
SAILORS TO ENSURE THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS. THE COLUMNS

ALL SAILORS FROM THE SEP 06 (CYCLE 192) AND MAR 07 (CYCLE 195) NAVY
