RMKS/1.  The annual Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Awards Program recognizes 
the Department of Defense's (DoD) most outstanding field-level and depot-
level military maintenance units from a highly competitive field of 
candidates. I would like to extend my congratulations and gratitude for all 
Navy units that submitted nomination packages in accordance with references 
(a) and (b). Each nominee should be proud of their accomplishments. 
 
2.  Reference (c) announced the 2021 SECDEF Maintenance Award winners for the 
entire DoD. I am pleased to inform you that the following Navy Commands have 
been selected as winners of the 2021 SECDEF Maintenance Awards: 
    a.  Field-Level Small Category and Phoenix Award: Helicopter Maritime 
Strike 
    Squadron SEVEN SEVEN (HSM-77), Naval Air Facility, Atsugi, Japan 
    b.  Field-Level Medium  Category:  Assault Craft Unit Five (ACU-5), 
Marine 
    Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, California 
    c.  Field-Level Large Category:  USS AMERICA (LHA-6), Sasebo, Japan 
    d.  Robert T. Mason Award for Depot Maintenance Excellence: Puget Sound 
    Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS & IMF)

3.  The overall DoD Phoenix Award winner was announced as HSM-77. The Phoenix 
Award represents the very best of all the field-level winners, and is the 
highest SECDEF award for field-level maintenance. Typically, the announcement 
of this award occurs during the SECDEF Maintenance Awards Ceremony at the DoD 
Maintenance Symposium; however, the 2021 DoD Maintenance Symposium is 
cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
4.  Please join me in congratulating each of our Navy winners for a job well 
Done. You represent the very best of our military maintenance community which 
contributes directly to the readiness of our Navy. BRAVO ZULU!
