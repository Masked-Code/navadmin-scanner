RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the August 2019 Active-Duty 
Officer Lateral Transfer and Redesignation Board.  The lateral transfer and 
redesignation process is a key tool by which the Navy manages the talents of 
its officers.  It provides flexibility in officer community manning and 
improves the Navy return on investment in officer training and education by 
leveraging the specialized skillsets of officers throughout their careers.  
As part of the process, applications from qualified Unrestricted Line, 
Restricted Line, Staff Corps and non-off-ramp Limited Duty Officers
(LDO) are now being accepted for the Active-Duty Officer Lateral Transfer and 
Redesignation Board, which convenes on 27 August 2019.
Officers in LDO off-ramp communities requesting to redesignate with their 
parent community are not eligible to apply for this board but will use the 
without board action process (as required).  Full-Time Support and Selected 
Reserve officers are not eligible to apply for this board.  All officers 
considering applying for lateral transfer or redesignation through this board 
are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with references (a) through 
(k).

2.  In addition to the year group (YG) limitations imposed in paragraph 6, 
applicants must also meet eligibility requirements detailed in references (a) 
through (c) and are required to review and comply with any additional 
community requirements found in the August 2019 letter of instruction, which 
can be viewed via MyNavy Portal at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-
planning/overview.
    a.  Officers who do not meet eligibility requirements in line with 
references (a) through (c) such as time-in-grade, years-of- commissioned 
service or time-in-service must submit a waiver request in addition to or in 
conjunction with their lateral transfer and redesignation application as 
specified by specific communities.
    b.  All application packages must include a letter from the current 
commanding officer (CO), acknowledging their review of the application.  It 
should include their positive or negative endorsement of the application of 
the officer and specifically address any waiver requests by the officer.  
These letters must be dated within 60 days of the application deadline.
    c.  Active Component LDOs in the Supply Corps (651X) and Information 
Warfare Community (IWC) (68XX) are designated for off- ramp as listed in 
reference (j).  Those who desire to redesignate within their parent 
communities should submit their requests in line with reference (j) vice this 
board.

3.  Submit applications and waiver requests (as required), using the format 
in reference (b) via email to BUPERS-3_LATXFR.fct(at) navy.mil.  The email 
subject line should reflect *August 2019 Active-Duty Officer Lateral Transfer 
and Redesignation Board.*  If no means of electronic correspondence are 
available, hard copy application packages can be sent via U.S. Postal and 
Express Mail Services (to include FedEx, UPS and DHL) to:

7.  Notes:
    a.  Must have Surface Warfare Officer (SWO) qualification completed to 
apply for transfer.  Officers under revised Junior Critical Skills Retention 
Bonus, Lieutenant Commander (LCDR) Retention Bonus or Department Head (DH) 
Retention Bonus contract are not eligible for transfer until completion of 
bonus obligation.
SWOs serving under an agreement for any of the SWO bonuses are eligible to 
apply to the board if the board convening date is within
1 year of satisfaction of the full bonus obligation.  Lateral transfer out 
quotas may be limited due to manning levels for any given YG, community 
billet requirements, the status of DH contract goals for YGs with less than 6 
years of commissioned service and the individual officer assignment status.  
Officers within their detailing window must communicate with their detailer 
prior to submitting a lateral transfer application.  Executing orders, 
slating to a billet, serving in a hard fill billet or one with significant 
training required could disqualify an officer for consideration and release 
from the community until arrival to the next duty station or minimum activity 
tour is complete.  Requests for lateral transfer out of the SWO community 
from O-4 and above will be considered on a case-by-case basis due to 
shortages in these grades.
    b.  Waivers to the requirements for Nuclear-Trained Surface and Submarine 
Warfare Officers in paragraph 4h of reference (b) may be considered on a 
case-by-case basis.
        (1) For Submarine Warfare Officers, lateral transfer out quotas may 
be limited due to manning levels for any given YG, the billet requirements of 
the community, the status of DH contract goals for YGs with less than 6 years 
of commissioned service and the individual officer assignment status.
        (2) Submarine Warfare Officers will not normally be released for 
lateral transfer out quotas if greater than 12 months from their projected 
rotation date (PRD).  Parent commands endorsing a lateral transfer request 
should acknowledge that lateral transfer of an officer in advance of his/her 
PRD may result in a gap.  Officers within their detailing window must 
communicate with their detailer prior to submitting a lateral transfer 
application.  Executing orders, slating to a billet or serving in a hard fill 
billet or one with significant training required could disqualify an officer 
for consideration and release from the community until arrival to the next 
duty station or minimum activity tour is complete.
        (3) Submarine Warfare Officers will not be released for lateral 
transfer if currently serving in an at-sea billet due to relief timings and 
gapping a critical at-sea billet.  On a case-by- case basis, DHs in an at-sea 
assignment will be considered for release but will not normally laterally 
transfer until a relief has been identified.  Lateral transfer will occur at 
the normal rotation timing.
    c.  Officers commissioned under a still-valid SWO-option agreement 
(Engineering Duty, Intelligence, Information Professional (IP), Cryptologic 
Warfare (CW), Oceanography (OCEANO)) must contact their respective restricted 
line option community manager regarding the desire to be released from the 
SWO-option agreement and seek lateral transfer to a different community.
    d.  Nuclear-trained SWOs YG-14 and senior have a limited opportunity for 
lateral transfer consideration.
    e.  Officers screened *not cleared* for their next career milestone are 
eligible.
    f.  The YG range provided displays possible opportunities.
Contact your specific community placement officer with questions regarding 
quota availability for each type/model/series/YG.  General Aviation Officers 
(1300) are eligible to apply for lateral transfer regardless of Active-Duty 
Service Obligation (ADSO) from winging.
Aviation Officers (131X and 132X) are eligible to apply for a lateral 
transfer if the officer has fulfilled ADSO or is within 12 months of 
completing ADSO at the time the board convenes.  Aviation Officers with 
obligated service as a result of Aviation Bonus (AvB) are eligible to apply 
if the officer will be within 12 months of completing AvB obligation at the 
time the board convenes.
Additionally, Aviation Officers with obligated service as a result of AvB are 
eligible to apply if the officer will be within 12 months of DH tour PRD at 
the time the board convenes, regardless of contrary AvB contract language.  
Redesignation immediately following DH tour may result in cancellation of 
aviation incentive pay and AvB, which will be adjudicated by the Aviation 
Officer Assignment Division (PERS-43).  Graduates from U.S. Naval Test Pilot 
School class 152 and 153 may apply for Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer
(AEDO) only, regardless of ADSO (contact AEDO Officer Community Manager (OCM) 
for details).  If selected, Aviation Officers should expect to redesignate 
immediately.  Exceptions may be made for the completion of ADSO, fulfillment, 
expiration or cancellation of AvB contract or PRD, as determined by Aviation 
OCM (BUPERS-313).
Aviation Officers in operational flying billets (billet designator
XXX1 or XXX2) will not redesignate until vacating the billet.
BUPERS-313 authorizes redesignation timing.  By accepting a lateral transfer 
out of Aviation (13XX), effective the date of redesignation with the lateral 
transfer application and the endorsement of the CO fulfilling the 
requirements set forth in reference (h), an officer consents to voluntary 
termination of flight status (except for AEDO selects).
    g.  Engineering Duty Officer (ED) Community.
        (1) Applicants desiring lateral transfer out quotas from

    j.  Naval Special Warfare (NSW) will no longer consider or select lateral 
transfers via this board.  All applicants will be considered by a separate 
NSW selection process and must submit their application via current OCM to 
the Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) OCM.  Those interested are encouraged to contact 
the SEAL OCM or visit the SEAL OCM website for package requirements, 
submission dates and eligibility.
    k.  Eligible officers in YG-17 and junior will be considered for lateral 
transfer and redesignation as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal

graduate education and/or experience and/or those with an academic profile 
code of 325 or better are encouraged to apply.
    m.  Officers who are one-time failure to select for LCDR will not be 
considered for lateral transfer to 1510.  Aviation Officers
(13XX) are eligible and may apply for 1510 (only) regardless of ADSO if they 
are a graduate of U.S. Naval Test Pilot School class 152 or class 153.
    n.  Officers are strongly encouraged to contact the Aerospace Maintenance 
Duty OCM to discuss milestones and qualifications commensurate with YG.
    o.  All applicants should be within 18 months of PRD to apply.
