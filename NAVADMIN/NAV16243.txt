NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 253/15, CONDITIONAL REENLISTMENT FROM FULL TIME 
SUPPORT TO ACTIVE COMPONENT.  REF B IS MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1160-030, CERTAIN 
ENLISTMENTS AND REENLISTMENTS UNDER CONTINUOUS SERVICE CONDITIONS.  REF C IS 
MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1160-140, CAREER WAYPOINTS-REENLISTMENT.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a) and must be read in its 
entirety.  It announces new opportunities for Sailors in competitive active 
component (AC) ratings/ Navy Occupational Specialties (NOS) to apply for 
reenlistment into the same Full-Time Support (FTS) ratings/NOS that are 
either balanced or open and clarifies the process to apply for component 
change from FTS to AC. This policy change aligns with Navys Talent Management 
and Continuum of Service efforts by streamlining processes and policy that 
provide increased opportunities to change from one component to the other, 
thereby maximizing talent reutilization within the total force. This will be 
further codified in an upcoming MILPERSMAN update.

2.  Sailors should work closely with their Command Career Counselors to 
determine their eligibility under this initiative and to identify available 
opportunities.

3.  Application Procedures.  AC and FTS Sailors applying for a component 
change must meet all reenlistment eligibility requirements as outlined in 
reference (b).  The requirement to be in the Career Waypoints-Reenlistment 
(C-WAY-REEN) window, as outlined in reference (c), is waived when applying 
for a component change between the AC and FTS under this initiative.
    a.  E-3 through E-6 Sailors with 14 years or less of active service as of 
their soft expiration of active obligated service (SEAOS) may submit a 
Special Circumstances Convert Only application in their current rate via the 
C-WAY-REEN module after completing 24 months onboard their current command.
    b.  E-6 Sailors with greater than 14 years of active service as of their 
SEAOS, as well as E-7 and above Sailors, may submit an Enlisted Personnel 
Action Request (NAVPERS 1306/7) via their chain of command to Enlisted Active 
Programs Branch (PERS-811) for authorization to execute a component change 
reenlistment in their current rate.  Sailors must complete 24 months onboard 
their current command before submitting an application.
    c.  Upon receipt of C-WAY-REEN or PERS-811 approval, Sailors must contact 
their prospective AC or FTS detailer to discuss follow on orders.
    d.  Sailors approved for a component change reenlistment must reenlist 
for a period equal to or greater than their current enlistment obligation.
    e.  C-WAY eligible Sailors who apply for and are not approved under this 
initiative may apply for component change reenlistment during their normal C-
WAY-REEN application window.
    f.  E-6 Sailors with greater than 14 years of active service as of their 
SEAOS, as well as E-7 and above Sailors who apply for a component change 
reenlistment and are not approved may apply for subsequent opportunities as 
they become available by following the application guidance contained in this 
NAVADMIN.

4.  Navy personnel can contact the Navy Personnel Command Call Center in 
Millington, TN at (866) U-Ask-NPC or via e-mail at uasknpc(at)navy.mil with 
questions.
