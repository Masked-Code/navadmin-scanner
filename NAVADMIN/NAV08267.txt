2.  TO ENSURE OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS NOW AND IN THE FUTURE, OUR NAVY 
MUST RETAIN THE TALENTS OF OUR RESERVE COMPONENT (RC) SAILORS.  A 
VIGOROUS RETENTION PLAN REQUIRES FLEXIBLE TOOLS TO ENSURE WE ARE 
RETAINING THE CORRECT NUMBER OF SAILORS WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS TO 
OPTIMIZE OUR WARFIGHTING CAPABILITY. 
3.  THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CLARIFY THE BONUS PROGRAM.  GUIDANCE IN 
THIS NAVADMIN SUPERSEDES REF B IN ANY AREA WHERE THE TWO MAY VARY. 
    A.  GENERAL:  
        (1) ALL TIER ONE AND ALL SIX-YEAR REENLISTMENT BONUSES 
REGARDLESS OF TIER LEVEL ARE PAYABLE VIA LUMP SUM.  ALL OTHER THREE-
YEAR REENLISTMENT BONUSES (TIER TWO AND TIER THREE) WILL BE PAYABLE VIA 
ONE-HALF INITIAL PAYMENT AND TWO SUBSEQUENT EQUAL ANNIVERSARY PAYMENTS.  
SAILORS ARE HIGHLY ENCOURAGED TO REENLIST FOR A SIX-YEAR DRILLING 
RESERVE (IN PAY) OBLIGATION TO MAXIMIZE THEIR BONUS OPPORTUNITY.
        (2) SAILOR'S CURRENT END OF OBLIGATED SERVICE (EOS) DATE MUST 
BE BETWEEN DATE OF RELEASE OF MESSAGE AND 30 SEP 09 TO BE ELIGIBLE TO 
REENLIST FOR A BONUS. 
        (3) SAILORS MUST NOT HAVE MORE THAN 16 YEARS TOTAL MILITARY 
SERVICE AS CALCULATED FROM THEIR PAY ENTRY BASE DATE (PEBD) ON THE DATE 
OF THE QUALIFYING REENLISTMENT DATE OR EXTENSION EFFECTIVE DATE.
        (4)  NAVY RESERVE SAILORS DESIRING TO EXTEND THEIR ENLISTMENT 
FOR 36 MONTHS TO QUALIFY FOR A THREE-YEAR REENLISTMENT/EXTENSION BONUS 
MUST BE WITHIN 90 DAYS OF THEIR CURRENT END OF OBLIGATED SERVICE (EOS) 
DATE PRIOR TO EFFECTING (SIGNING) SUCH EXTENSION.  THE BONUS 
ELIGIBILITY DATE (DATE OF OBLIGATION AND BONUS PAY DATE) WILL BE THE 
OPERATIVE DATE OF THE EXTENSION.  REFER TO MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1160-070 
REGARDING OTHER EXTENSION OF CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS.
        (5)  NAVY RESERVE SAILORS CURRENTLY SERVING UNDER A CONTRACTUAL 
OBLIGATION FOR A PREVIOUS NAVY RESERVE BONUS ARE REQUIRED TO BE WITHIN 
30 DAYS OF COMPLETION OF THIS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION PRIOR TO 
REENLISTING TO QUALIFY FOR A REENLISTMENT BONUS.  FAILURE TO MEET THIS 
REQUIREMENT WILL RESULT IN EARLY TERMINATION OF THE PREVIOUS BONUS AND 
RECOUPMENT OF THE UNEARNED PORTION OF SUCH BONUS.
    B.  CHANGE OF RATE BONUS:  NAVY RESERVE SAILORS CURRENTLY SERVING 
IN THE SELECTED RESERVE WHO ARE APPROVED FOR CHANGE OF RATE TO A BONUS

MUST BE SUBMITTED CONCURRENTLY WITH THEIR CHANGE OF RATE REQUEST.
            (C) A BONUS SHALL BE PROCESSED AND PAID TO SAILORS IN THIS 
CATEGORY AFTER THEIR REENLISTMENT AND IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIPT OF THEIR

SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF ALL LATERAL CHANGE OF RATE REQUIREMENTS.
