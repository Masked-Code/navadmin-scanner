5.  LESSONS LEARNED.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ADDRESSES LESSONS 
LEARNED FROM THE FY-09 STA-21 SELECTION PROCESS AND BOARD.  THIS 
INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO PRECLUDE COMMON ERRORS.
    A.  OF 1,000 APPLICATIONS RECEIVED, ONLY 682 WERE BOARD ELIGIBLE.  
A TOTAL OF 210 WERE SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FY-09 STA-21 PROGRAM.
    B.  COMMON REASONS FOR DETERMINATION OF INELIGIBILITY:  
NON-QUALIFYING SAT/ACT TEST SCORES, NO SAT/ACT TEST SCORES SUBMITTED, 
NO COMMANDING OFFICER'S (CO) ENDORSEMENT, RECENT NON-JUDICIAL 
PUNISHMENT, AND MISSING OR ILLEGIBLE SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTS.
    C.  MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET BEFORE SUBMITTING 
AN APPLICATION.  THE SELECTION PROCESS IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE.  
APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE MAILED ONLY WHEN FULLY COMPLETE.  OFFICER 
INTERVIEW BOARDS AND THE CO'S PERSONAL INTERVIEW SHOULD ONLY BE 
CONDUCTED AFTER THE APPLICATION IS COMPLETE.  THE FULL PICTURE OF AN 
APPLICANT'S ACADEMIC POTENTIAL CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED BY REVIEWING THE 
SAT/ACT SCORES AND HIGH SCHOOL/COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS.
    D.  AN INTERVIEW BOARD AND NOMINATION REVIEW BOARD SHALL BE 
CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH REF A.  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT OFFICERS OF 
THE APPLICANT'S DESIGNATOR CHOICE, IF AVAILABLE AT A BASE OR COMMAND, 
BE ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERVIEW/NOMINATION REVIEW BOARD TO 
ASSESS THE APPLICANT FOR THEIR COMMUNITY.  NOMINATION REVIEW BOARDS 
SHOULD BE EXTERNAL TO THE COMMAND.  IN THE EVENT THAT A NOMINATION 
REVIEW BOARD OUTSIDE OF THE COMMAND CANNOT BE CONVENED, THE COMMAND 
SHOULD PRESENT THREE ADDITIONAL INTERVIEW APPRAISALS TO ADD TO THE 
PACKAGE OR AN EXPLANATION OF WHY THE DIRECTED PROCESS COULD NOT BE 
FOLLOWED.  FOR JUNIOR SAILORS WITH ONLY SCHOOLHOUSE EVALUATIONS, THE CO 
MUST ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN THEIR ENDORSEMENT.  SAILORS MUST ADDRESS ANY 
HARDSHIPS OR UNIQUE EXPERIENCES THAT SHAPED THEIR CHARACTER AND JUNIOR 
SAILORS SHOULD PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCES.  HIGH 
SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS RARELY PROVIDE IN DEPTH INFORMATION ON INVOLVEMENT 
IN SPORTS, CLUBS, VOLUNTEER WORK, ETC.  EACH CANDIDATE SHOULD BE 
INSTRUCTED TO INCLUDE IN THEIR PERSONAL STATEMENT REASON(S) FOR THEIR 
INTEREST IN THE STA-21 PROGRAM, AND WHAT THEY WOULD DO WITH THE 
OPPORTUNITY IF SELECTED.  ADDITIONALLY, APPLICANTS SHOULD EXPLAIN ANY 
MITIGATING ISSUES THE BOARD NEEDS TO CONSIDER (I.E., POOR HIGH SCHOOL 
OR COLLEGE GRADES AND UNEXPLAINED GAPS).
6.  DIVERSITY WITHIN THE NAVY'S OFFICER COMMUNITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR 
FUTURE SUCCESS.  THE NAVY NEEDS LEADERS FROM AND FOR EVERY PART OF OUR 
NAVY.  ALL CO'S, COMMAND CAREER COUNSELORS AND SENIOR ENLISTED MEMBERS 
SHOULD ENCOURAGE QUALIFIED SAILORS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM.
7.  MAIL APPLICATIONS TO:
    COMMANDER
