RMKS/1. HURRICANE KATRINA DIRECTLY IMPACTED AN ESTIMATED 18,000 NAVY
FAMILIES.  IN FACT, MANY OF THE SAILORS PROVIDING RELIEF TO LOCAL



PAGE 02 RUEWMFU0966 UNCLAS
CITIZENS ARE IN NEED OF RELIEF THEMSELVES.  MOST HAVE LOST
SOMETHING; SOME HAVE LOST EVERYTHING.
2.  THROUGHOUT THE CRISIS, EVEN AS OUR EFFORTS TO SUPPORT THE JOINT
TASK FORCE RAMPED UP, WE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO
HELP NAVY FAMILIES GET BACK ON THEIR FEET.  THE NAVY PERSONNEL
COMMAND RAPIDLY STOOD UP AN EMERGENCY CALL CENTER IN MILLINGTON TO
FOSTER COMMUNICATIONS AND ANSWER QUESTIONS (THE NUMBER IS
1-877-414-5358, AND IT IS STILL ACTIVE).  NAVAL INSTALLATIONS
COMMAND ESTABLISHED COMMUNITY SUPPORT CENTERS AT NAS MERIDIAN, NAS
JRB NEW ORLEANS, NS PASCAGOULA, AND CBC GULFPORT TO PROVIDE A BROAD
RANGE OF SERVICES, INCLUDING CRISIS INTERVENTION AND SPIRITUAL
COUNSELING, HOUSING REFERRAL, LEGAL ASSISTANCE AND EVEN BASIC
MEDICAL CARE.  THE NAVY-MARINE CORPS RELIEF SOCIETY HAS ALREADY
PROCESSED MORE THAN 4,000 CASES, DISTRIBUTING OVER $1.5M IN DISASTER
ASSISTANCE FUNDS.  AND TRICARE DISPATCHED ADDITIONAL STAFF TO A
LARGE NUMBER OF EVACUEE SITES TO PROVIDE FACE-TO-FACE COUNSELING FOR
KATRINA BENEFICIARIES.
3.  THESE ARE GREAT EFFORTS -- NECESSARY EFFORTS -- AND THEY WILL
CONTINUE.  BUT WE NEED TO BETTER ORGANIZE AND COORDINATE THEM.  WE
NEED LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS.  THATS WHY I ORDERED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF



PAGE 03 RUEWMFU0966 UNCLAS
TASK FORCE NAVY FAMILY (TFNF).  LED BY RADM BOB PASSMORE, TFNF WILL
CONDUCT FULL SPECTRUM COMMUNITY SERVICE OPERATIONS TO PROVIDE A
RAPID AND COORDINATED RETURN TO A STABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR
AFFECTED NAVY FAMILY. THAT S THE MISSION.
4.  AND WHEN I SAY  FULL SPECTRUM,  I MEAN IT.  AS STIPULATED IN REF
(A), FULL SPECTRUM COMMUNITY SERVICE OPERATIONS WILL INCLUDE BUT ARE
NOT LIMITED TO: 1) FULL ACCOUNTING OF AFFECTED NAVY FAMILY MEMBERS;
2) AVAILABILITY OF TEMPORARY HOUSING; 3) WAY AHEAD FOR PERMANENT
HOUSING WHERE AUTHORIZED; 4) FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND COUNSELING; 5)
RETURN TO SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN; 6) TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS FOR
RELOCATION, WORK AND SCHOOL; 7) ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES; 8)
ACCESS TO PASTORAL AND FAMILY COUNSELING SERVICES; 9) ACCESS TO
CHILD CARE; 10) ACCESS TO LEGAL SERVICES, INCLUDING CLAIMS SUPPORT;
AND 11) EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT.
5.  JUST TO BE CLEAR, THE NAVY FAMILY CONSISTS OF: NAVY SERVICE
MEMBERS (ACTIVE AND RESERVE, OTHER SERVICE MEMBERS ASSIGNED TO NAVY
COMMANDS OR TENANTS ON NAVY INSTALLATIONS PENDING CONCURRENCE OF
THEIR RESPECTIVE
SERVICES) AND THEIR FAMILIES; NAVY RETIREES AND THEIR FAMILIES;
CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES OF DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY AND THEIR FAMILIES; AND



PAGE 04 RUEWMFU0966 UNCLAS
MAY INCLUDE CERTAIN EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS (DEFINED AS PARENTS,
PARENTS-IN-LAW, GUARDIANS, BROTHERS, SISTERS, BROTHERS-IN-LAW,
SISTERS-IN-LAW) OF DECEASED, INJURED, OR MISSING NAVY SERVICE
MEMBERS, NAVY RETIREES OR DON CIVILIANS WITHIN THE JOA; FAMILY
MEMBERS IN THE JOA OF NAVY SERVICE MEMBERS/CIVILIANS.
6.  RADM PASSMORE IS REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE VCNO AND WILL BE
SUPPORTED BY TWO DEPUTIES, RDML ROBERT REILLY (MILITARY PERSONNEL
ISSUES) AND MS DEBRA EDMOND (CIVILIAN PERSONNEL ISSUES). HE WILL
COORDINATE HIS EFFORTS CLOSELY WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AND
NON-GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AS APPROPRIATE, TO INCLUDE JTF KATRINA,
APPLICABLE OSD, NAVY SECRETARIAT AND OPNAV STAFF, DEPARTMENT OF
VETERANS AFFAIRS, AMERICAN RED CROSS, AND THE NAVY MARINE CORPS
RELIEF SOCIETY, JUST TO NAME A FEW.
7.  I WANT THE NET CAST WIDE, AND I WANT IT HAULED IN OFTEN.  THERE
ARE PEOPLE HURTING OUT THERE -- OUR PEOPLE AND THEIR LOVED ONES --
AND WE WILL DO ALL WE CAN TO ALLEVIATE THEIR PAIN.  I LIKEN IT TO A
MAN OVERBOARD.  YOU SHIFT THE RUDDER OVER, GO TO FLANK SPEED, AND
PLUCK THE SAILOR OUT OF THE WATER.  IN MY VIEW, WE VE GOT NEARLY
45,000 PEOPLE  IN THE WATER  RIGHT NOW, AND WE RE GOING TO PICK THEM
UP.

8.  WE WILL NEED YOUR HELP TO DO IT. WHETHER YOU KNOW SOMEONE HIT
HARD BY KATRINA OR NOT, PLEASE REACH OUT.  GIVE OF YOUR TIME AND
YOUR TALENT TO ONE OF THE MANY VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS CONTRIBUTING
TO THE RELIEF EFFORT.  CHECK ON A FRIEND.  CHECK ON A STRANGER.  GET
INVOLVED AND STAY INVOLVED.  FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, EVERY PERSON
SERVING OUR NAVY NOT DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE HURRICANE SHOULD
CONSIDER THEMSELVES ADDU TO TFNF.  YOU ARE KEY MEMBERS OF THE TEAM.
9.  THE NAVY IS DOING GREAT WORK ON THE GULF COAST.  I VE SEEN IT
FIRSTHAND AND COULDN T BE MORE PROUD OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS WE VE
MADE.  BUT NOTHING WE DO, NO MATTER HOW BADLY NEEDED OR SINCERELY
APPRECIATED IT MIGHT BE, IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN CARING FOR THOSE WHO
MAKE THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS POSSIBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
10.  HURRICANE KATRINA DEVASTATED CITIES AND TOWNS.  IT TOOK LIVES.
BY DAMAGING OUR BASES IN THAT REGION, IT EVEN CHIPPED AWAY AT SOME
OF OUR COMBAT CAPABILITY.  BUT IT DID NOT DESTROY THE HUMAN SPIRIT.
IT DID NOT DESTROY THE NAVY FAMILY.  NO STORM CAN WIPE THAT OUT.  WE
WILL STAND BY THE NAVY FAMILY AS THE NAVY FAMILY HAS STOOD BY US.  I
KNOW I CAN RELY ON YOUR SUPPORT.
