2.  THE LATERAL TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION BOARD IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE.  EACH 
RECORD THAT IS PRESENTED TO THE BOARD IS CAREFULLY REVIEWED AND THE BEST AND 
MOST FULLY QUALIFIED ARE CHOSEN. 

3.  QUOTA CONSTRAINTS FOR JUNIOR YEAR GROUPS (05 THROUGH 09) WERE ESPECIALLY 
TIGHT THUS THE DEMAND SIGNAL FAR EXCEEDED THE SUPPLY POOL.  MANY QUALITY 
APPLICANTS WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE BOARD BUT COULD NOT BE SELECTED DUE TO QUOTA 
CONSTRAINTS OF EITHER OUTGOING COMMUNITY OR GAINING COMMUNITY.  THEREFORE, NOT 
BEING SELECTED FOR THIS BOARD IS NOT A REASON TO FEEL THAT YOU HAVE NO FUTURE 
CHANCE.  YOU SHOULD APPLY AGAIN (AND AGAIN AS REQUIRED), ALL THE WHILE 
SUSTAINING SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE AND BOLSTERING YOUR RECORD FOR YOUR DESIRED 
COMMUNITY.  WHAT MAKES YOUR RECORD STANDOUT IS MOTIVATION TOWARDS YOUR GAINING 
COMMUNITY AS WELL AS CONTINUED PROMOTABILITY. 

4.  AS ALWAYS, COMPETITION FOR REDESIGNATION WAS KEEN AND EVERY 
COMMUNITY HAD A POOL OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES.  ELIGIBLE OFFICERS NOT 
INITIALLY SELECTED, AND WHO DID NOT SPECIFICALLY REQUEST NOT TO BE REVIEWED BY 
COMMUNITIES OTHER THAN THEIR FIRST OR SECOND CHOICE, WERE SUBSEQUENTLY 
REVIEWED BY ALL OTHER COMMUNITIES.  THOSE OFFICERS TENTATIVELY SELECTED FOR 
COMMUNITIES NOT INITIALLY REQUESTED WILL BE NOTIFIED VIA OFFICIAL 
CORRESPONDENCE AND OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDESIGNATE.

5.  THE PROCESS, WHILE NEVER PERFECT, IS FAIR AND THOROUGH.  BOARD MEMBERS ARE 
FOCUSED ON THEIR TASK: PICKING THE RIGHT CANDIDATE WHO IS FULLY AND BEST 
QUALIFIED FROM THE AVAILABLE APPLICANTS.  EACH RECORD RECEIVES A DETAILED 
SCRUB AND THERE IS THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE DISCUSSIONS ON EACH APPLICANT.

6.  THIS MSG IS NOT AUTHORITY TO DELIVER CHANGE OF DESIGNATOR LETTERS TO THE 
SELECTEE.
    A.  OFFICERS WHO ARE PROMOTION SELECTEES SHOULD CONTACT THEIR 
CURRENT DETAILER TO DISCUSS REDESIGNATION TIMING.  COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-
803), UPON NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) THAT THE SELECTEE HAS 
BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO THEIR NEW COMMUNITY, WILL FORWARD A 
REDESIGNATION LETTER TO THE SELECTEE OR APPOINTMENT ACCEPTANCE AND OATH OF 
OFFICE (NAVPERS 1000/4), AS APPLICABLE.
    B.  OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT PROMOTION SELECTEES AND WHO ARE NOT UNDER 
ORDERS CAN EXPECT ASSIGNMENT TO A NEW BILLET APPROPRIATE TO THEIR NEW 
DESIGNATION WHEN NOTIFIED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4).
    C.  IF A MEMBER IS CURRENTLY UNDER ORDERS AND TRANSFERS PRIOR TO
NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4), MEMBER MUST EXECUTE ORDERS 
UNDER CURRENT DESIGNATOR AND MUST COMPLETE 12 MONTHS AT THE NEW 
ASSIGNMENT, UNLESS A SHORTER TOUR IS PRESCRIBED (TOURS IN EXCESS OF ONE 
YEAR WILL BE WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE GAINING COMMUNITY), PRIOR TO 
REDESIGNATION.

7.  THE FOLLOWING ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE ABOVE:
    A.  SURFACE WARFARE (11XX) OFFICERS WHO ARE UNDER ORDERS TO 
DEPARTMENT HEAD SCHOOL MAY NOT LATERALLY TRANSFER UNTIL COMPLETION OF 
INITIAL DEPARTMENT HEAD TOUR. 
    B.  AVIATION OFFICERS (131X AND 132X) SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED TO LATERAL 
TRANSFER UNTIL COMPLETION OF ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE OBLIGATION, EXPIRATION OF 
AVIATION CAREER CONTINUATION PAY CONTRACT, OR PLANNED ROTATION DATE, WHICHEVER 
IS LATER.
    C.  APPLICANTS FOR 1510 WHO ARE PRESENTLY DESIGNATED 131X OR 132X 
AND A SECOND SEA TOUR OR AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD TOUR HAS NOT BEEN 
COMPLETED, ASSIGNMENT TO 1510 BILLETS MAY BE DELAYED UNTIL THE 
COMPLETION OF APPLICABLE SECOND SEA AND/OR AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD 
TOUR, AS DETERMINED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-43).

8.  COMMANDING OFFICER SHALL:
    A.  ENSURE OFFICERS SELECTED FOR PROMOTION WITHIN THEIR CURRENT 
COMMUNITY DO NOT ACCEPT REDESIGNATION BEFORE THEIR PROMOTION DATE.
    B.  NOTIFY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-803) WITHIN 30 DAYS OF RELEASE OF 
THIS MESSAGE OF SELECTEES WHO DO NOT DESIRE TO ACCEPT TRANSFER/ 
REDESIGNATION.

9.  THE NEXT TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION BOARD WILL BE HELD 11 JUNE 2012.
APPLICATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 6 APR 2012.  PREVIOUS APPLICATIONS ARE NOT 
RETAINED, NON-SELECTEES FROM PREVIOUS BOARDS MUST SUBMIT A NEW APPLICATION FOR 
CONSIDERATION.  A FUTURE NAVADMIN WILL STIPULATE ALL OF THE ELIGIBILITY 
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION PROCEDURES IAW REF A THRU D.
