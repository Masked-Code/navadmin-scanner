RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the implementation of a critical skills 
retention bonus (CSRB) program per ref (a), as modified by refs (b) and (c), 
for Selected Reserve (SELRES) Naval Special Warfare Seal officers as 
designated in refs (d) and (e).  This program is effective upon release of 
this message and remains in effect until superseded by another NAVADMIN or 6 
February 2016, whichever occurs first.

2.  To ensure operational readiness today and into the future, the Navy must 
retain the highest quality and best qualified officers.  A vigorous retention 
plan requires flexible tools to ensure retention of the right number of 
officers in the skills necessary to optimize our warfighting capability.

3.  Program Guidance.
    a.  Officer eligibility criteria (criteria below without references are 
Navy Reserve imposed for the purposes of this CSRB program's administration):
        (1) Per ref (a), must be currently serving in the Navy's SELRES in a 
drilling status.  Members currently serving in the Individual Ready Reserve 
(IRR), whether in Voluntary Training Unit (VTU) or Active Status Pool (ASP) 
are ineligible.
Note:  members currently serving in the IRR are highly encouraged to contact 
a Navy recruiting officer regarding potential eligibility of 
incentives/bonuses for affiliating in the Selected Reserve in a drilling 
status.
        (2) Per ref (d), must be worldwide deployable.
        (3) Must have served satisfactorily in the Navy Reserve in a drilling 
SELRES status for a minimum of three years prior to application for this 
CSRB.
        (4) Per ref (a) and ref (f) section 355, must not have completed more 
than 25 years of service (YOS) in an active status in the Navy Reserve, and 
will not complete 25 YOS prior to the end of the period of active service in 
the Navy Reserve for which the bonus is offered.
        (5) Per refs (a) and (d), member must not be in receipt of Special 
Warfare Officer Continuation Pay.
        (6) Must not be under any other contractual obligation to serve in 
the Selected Reserve in a drilling status due to receipt of any other 
incentive (i.e. Officer Affiliation Bonus).  This includes any obligated 
service required to gain eligibility for the Montgomery GI Bill - Selected 
Reserve, or, to meet the eligibility criteria for transferability of 
entitlements under the Post-9/11 GI Bill program.
        (7) Per ref (d), member shall agree to serve in the Selected Reserve 
in a drilling status for a minimum of three years beyond their current

to serve satisfactorily in a drilling status in the Selected Reserve, and in 
a valid billet, for a period of three years from the date of my signature on 
this NAVPERS 1070/613. I fully understand that failure to satisfactorily 
complete this service obligation due to any reasons caused of my own volition 
shall result in immediate termination of my eligibility for this program, 
cancellation of any unpaid anniversary payments, and shall lead to recoupment 
of any unearned portion (if applicable) of the current bonus payment (initial 
or anniversary, as applicable) that I received.
I further understand that if termination is deemed due to my unsatisfactory 
participation that I shall not be eligible for any future entitlement under 
this program.  If I fail to complete the total period of Selected Reserve 
service in the Navy Reserve as specified in this obligation and in the 
DODINST 7000.14-r, DOD Financial Management Regulations, I shall be required
