AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1500.80 - COALITION OF SAILORS AGAINST DESTRUCTIVE 
DECISIONS PEER MENTORING GROUP//

RMKS/1.  REF A ANNOUNCED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COALITION OF SAILORS AGAINST 
DESTRUCTIVE DECISIONS (CSADD).  THE INTENT OF THIS NAVADMIN IS TO ANNOUNCE THE 
FIRST CSADD SEA AND SHORE CHAPTER OF THE YEAR.  THE SELECTION WAS BASED ON THE 
PROGRAM'S SCOPE OF ENGAGEMENT WITH SAILORS.  SEA AND SHORE CHAPTERS WILL BE 
SELECTED ANNUALLY RECOGNIZING OUR OUTSTANDING YOUNG SAILORS WORKING TO ENSURE 
WE ARE A GLOBAL FORCE FOR GOOD, WHILE EMPHASIZING THAT THE GOOD STARTS WITH 
SHIPMATES HELPING SHIPMATES TO REMAIN SUCCESSFUL.

2.  THE CSADD SEA CHAPTER OF THE YEAR GOES TO THE USS SAN JACINTO (CG 56), 
HOMEPORTED IN NORFOLK, VA.  THE SAILORS OF SAN JACINTO LEAD FROM THE FRONT, 
MAKING THEIR CSADD CHAPTER THE BEST IN THE FLEET.
THEY UTILIZED THEIR PROGRAM, TITLED "THE LOST," TO SHOW THE IMPACTS OF POOR 
DECISIONS AND SHARE THEIR IDEAS WITH OTHER AFLOAT UNITS ON THE NORFOLK 
WATERFRONT WHILE ENCOURAGING OTHER COMMANDS TO ESTABLISH CSADD CHAPTERS.

3.  THE CSADD SHORE CHAPTER OF THE YEAR IS NAVAL SUBMARINE BASE NEW LONDON IN 
GROTON, CT.  THIS CHAPTER SET THE STANDARD FOR ALL SHORE COMMANDS TO EMULATE 
AND ASSISTS OTHER COMMANDS IN FOLLOWING IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS.  THEIR ENGAGEMENT 
THROUGH SAFETY FAIRS AND VIDEO MESSAGING WITH THE NAVAL SAFETY CENTER HAS 
SPARKED OTHERS TO CONSIDER THESE COMMUNICATION OPPORTUNITIES.

4.  EACH CHAPTER WILL BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH A PLAQUE PRESENTATION.
CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL COMMANDS THAT HAVE AN ACTIVE CSADD CHAPTER.
YOU ARE LEADING THE WAY AND ENABLING SUCCESS FOR ALL.
