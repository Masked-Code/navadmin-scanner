RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN extends reference (a) and announces the policy and 
guidance for Calendar Year (CY) 2023 Meritorious Advancement Program (MAP) 
Season One for Active Duty (Active Component (AC) and Training and 
Administration of the Reserve (TAR)) Sailors.  CY-23 MAP Season One will run 
from 1 March through 15 April 2023.  This season continues the added 
preseason window for commands to verify user hierarchies and unit 
identification code (UIC) assignments ahead of the season.  The timeline in 
paragraph 3 contains details. 
 
2.  MAP will target approximately 20 percent of total advancements during CY-
23, with roughly half of the available MAP quotas allocated for each of the 
two MAP seasons during the year.  The two-season framework aligns MAP with 
the Navy-wide advancement exam (NWAE).  This is to ensure any unused MAP 
quotas are included in the NWAE cycle and to emphasize the intent of MAP to 
select and reward top performing Sailors.  To meet the required time-in-rate 
(TIR) for MAP advancement eligibility, Sailors must have a date of rank no 
later than the following: 
    a.  E-5:  1 January 2022. 
    b.  E-5 (Nuclear-Trained Sailors):  1 January 2021. 
    c.  E-4 and below:  No TIR requirement. 
 
3.  Timeline: 
    a.  MAP Pre-season:  6-19 February 2023. 
    b.  MAP Quotas Uploaded:  20 February 2023. 
    c.  CY-23 MAP Season One:  1 March - 15 April 2023. 
 
4.  In line with references (b) and (c), MAP advancement to ABH2, ABF2, GSM2 
CS2, MM2, IC2, DC2, and RS2 for AC Sailors is not authorized, due to those 
Sailors having advancement opportunities within Detailing Marketplace 
Assignment Policy (DMAP).  Additional details are located on the MyNavy HR 
DMAP website, https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
Management/Detailing/Enlisted/Detailing-Marketplace/ 
 
5.  Commands are required to have two Navy Standard Integrated Personnel 
System (NSIPS) MAP user roles (command reviewer and command reporting senior) 
in order to submit MAP advancement(s), exception(s) to policy (ETP), and 
additional MAP quota requests through NSIPS.  NSIPS Web Afloat users and 
commands without access to NSIPS should refer to paragraph 5a for 
instructions on submitting their MAP advancements.  The system will use 
authoritative data to determine eligibility, however, commands are required 
to locally validate that MAP candidates have successfully completed the 
professional military knowledge eligibility examination requirement prior to 
the first day of the MAP season (1 March 2023) as outlined in reference 
(d).  For training on user roles, log into NSIPS via 
https://www.nsips.navy.mil/, click on the training tab, then click 
MAP tutorial. 
    a.  NSIPS Web Afloat users and commands without access to NSIPS must 
submit a MAP nomination request via e-mail directly to their immediate 
superior in charge (ISIC), type commander (TYCOM), or budget submitting 
office (BSO)/Echelon II command using the meritorious certification letter 
(MCL).  The letter must be signed by the commanding officer and should 
address any ETP and/or additional quotas requested.  Sample MCLs and detailed 
information regarding the offline process can be found via MyNavy Portal 
(MNP)at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/a- 
enlisted-advancement-resources-and-links, then select the *Websites* 
tab in the blue banner, then select the MAP homepage. 
    b.  Quota usage, modifications, and distribution will be managed within 
the NSIPS environment.  BSO and command quotas will be uploaded into NSIPS on 
20 February 2023 and can be found under the quota summary report tab.  The 
list of points of contact for each BSO/Echelon II command and a list of 
parent and subordinate UICs can also be found on the above website.  Quotas 
can also be found via MNP at  
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/a-  
enlisted-advancement-resources-and-links, then select the *Websites* 
tab in the blue banner, then select the MAP homepage. 
    c.  Additional quotas can be requested using the quota request option by 
the command reviewer user role.  Commands must contact their BSO to determine 
a timeline for additional quota requests. Whether or not command quotas are 
authorized, all commands have the opportunity to request quotas from their 
BSO/Echelon II commands, via their ISIC and TYCOM, unless the rating is not 
authorized for MAP in line with paragraph 4. 
    d.  NSIPS will automatically determine if an ETP is required using 
predetermined criteria.  Sailors in ratings requiring security clearances and 
rates/pay grades requiring TIR waivers will be automatically routed for 
adjudication.  The request will be routed through the ISIC, TYCOM, and 
BSO/Echelon II commands using a hierarchical workflow. 
    e.  NSIPS will not automatically generate an ETP for nuclear-trained 
Sailors.  Commands desiring to advance nuclear-trained Sailors not meeting 
the TIR requirement must request an ETP from Director, Military Personnel 
Plans and Policy (OPNAV N13) via the Nuclear Program Manager (OPNAV N133). 
 
6.  Point of Contact:  MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) at (833) 330-6622 
or askmncc(at)navy.mil. 
 
7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
