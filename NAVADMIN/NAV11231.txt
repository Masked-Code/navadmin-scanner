1.  THIS IS THE 14TH IN A SERIES OF COMMUNICATIONS CONCERNING THE REPEAL OF 
SECTION 654 OF TITLE 10, KNOWN AS "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL"
(DADT).  THE PURPOSE OF THIS NAVADMIN IS TO ANNOUNCE THAT ON FRIDAY,
22 JULY, THE PRESIDENT, THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE 
JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF CERTIFIED TO CONGRESS THAT ALL OF THE MILITARY SERVICES 
ARE READY FOR REPEAL IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARDS OF MILITARY 
READINESS, MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS, UNIT COHESION, AND RECRUITING AND RETENTION 
OF THE ARMED FORCES.

2.  REPEAL OF DADT WILL BE EFFECTIVE ON 20 SEPTEMBER, WHICH IS 60 DAYS AFTER 
CERTIFICATION.  ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE WILL BE PROVIDED UPON 
REPEAL.

3.  THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, I REMAINED PERSONALLY ENGAGED WITH THE SECRETARY 
OF DEFENSE AND CHAIRMAN.  AFTER A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF NAVY'S POLICIES AND 
REGULATIONS AND CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF TRAINING PROGRESS, SAILOR FEEDBACK, 
AND INPUT FROM COMMAND LEADERSHIP, I INFORMED THEM THAT THE U.S. NAVY IS 
PREPARED TO IMPLEMENT REPEAL SECTION 654 OF TITLE 10.  FRIDAY'S CERTIFICATION 
TAKES US ONE STEP CLOSER TO THAT END.

4.  I REMAIN IMPRESSED WITH AND PROUD OF THE PROFESSIONALISM SHOWN BY ALL 
HANDS AS WE PREPARE FOR THE REPEAL OF DADT AND I AM CONFIDENT YOU WILL 
CONTINUE TO CONDUCT YOURSELVES WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF PROFESSIONALISM AND 
TREAT EACH OTHER WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT.
