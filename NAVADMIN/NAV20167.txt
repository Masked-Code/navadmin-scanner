RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the September 2020 (cycle 107) Navy-

Commencing with cycle 107, Canvasser Recruiters with special program 
indicator (SPI) code of *W* will take the SELRES exam and be rank- 
ordered for advancement with other SELRES candidates.  Full-Time 
Support personnel with a SPI code of *V* will take cycle 248 Active-

    a.  All candidates serving on voluntary recall or mobilization 
will compete for advancement as a SELRES.
    b.  This NAVADMIN supplements reference (a).
    c.  In addition to the requirements in chapter 6 of reference
(a) and this NAVADMIN, Educational Services Officers (ESO) must follow 
the pre-exam preparation requirements in the exam verbatim located on 
the Navy Enlisted Advancement System (NEAS) website via MyNavy Portal

the ending date that falls within the time period:
        (1) E-6 exam - 1 August 2017 to 31 July 2020
    h.  For guidance in establishing PMA for new accessions that have

participate in the NWAE to complete their rate conversion are only 
required to complete the PMK-EE if they are an E-3 and are eligible 
for advancement in conjunction with testing to complete rate 
conversion.
    k.  For guidance on establishing enlisted advancement worksheet
(EAW) user roles and completing worksheets, refer to reference (d).
EAW is mandatory for cycle 107.  EAW will be the authority for PMA, 
RSCA PMA and awards.

3.  Exam ordering.  Order exams in line with chapter 4 of reference 
(a).
    a.  Deploying commands and candidates departing to 
Congressionally-Designated Combat Zones and Approved Contingency 
Operations Areas (CDCZ/ACOA) can order exams up to 6 months prior to 
the scheduled exam date.  For additional guidance, refer to chapter
4 and paragraph 614 of reference (a).
    b.  Sensitive compartmented information (SCI) exams.
Cryptologic Technician Interpretive (CTI), Cryptologic Technician 
Networks (CTN) and Cryptologic Technician Collection (CTR) SCI exam 
ordering dates can be found on the NEAS website via MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-advancement-center/my-eso.  ESOs 
must verify initial TIR eligibility lists on the NEAS website for exam 
ordering.  Supplemental SCI exams are ordered via preferred message 
formatted e-mail to sfly_cryptologic.products(at)navy.mil or naval 
message following the guidelines in line with chapter 4 of reference 
(a).  The deadline for additional orders is 1 July 2020.
    c.  Non-SCI Exams:
        (1) Initial exam ordering for non-SCI exams will be available 
until 16 June 2020.  ESOs must verify TIR eligibility lists on the 
NEAS website.
        (2) Eligible candidates who were not added to the initial TIR 
list can be added to a supplemental TIR list.  Supplemental TIR lists 
will be available from 17 June 2020 to 19 July 2020.  The deadline to 
order supplemental SELRES exams is 30 September 2020.
    d.  Exams ordered after the TIR lists have closed and exams for 
prior service reenlistment eligible Reserve Sailors shall be ordered 
using preferred message formatted e-mail or naval message following 
the guidelines in chapter 4 of reference (a).  Ensure a point of 
contact is included in the submitted e-mail or message.
    e.  Exams for CDCZ/ACOA Sailors or recalled reservists will be 
ordered by the command holding the service record of the Service 
Member.  Authority is granted for these candidates to be administered 
exams with the Active-Duty candidates.  However, these candidates are 
still required to take the cycle 107 SELRES exam and not the cycle 248 
Active-Duty exam.
    f.  When an exam is not used during the normally scheduled event, 
do not destroy the exam prior to 1 October 2020.
    g.  Cycle 107 exams should only be administered during the month 
of September due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impact.  Requests 
for late exams should be made only for those candidates who, through 
no fault of their own, are unable to participate on the regularly 
scheduled NWAE administration date.
        (1) Since SELRES may take the NWAE anytime in the month of 
September, Annual Training (AT) and Additional Duty for Training
(ADT) orders are not a valid reason for Sailors to take the late exam.  
ESOs shall ensure that Sailors take the NWAE prior to going on AT/ADT 
orders or when Sailors return from their AT/ADT.  If a Sailor will be 
on AT/ADT during the entire month of the scheduled advancement exam, 
then the ESO shall coordinate with the gaining command to forward the 
Sailors exam and EAW.
       (2) Naval Education and Training Professional Development 
Center (NETPDC) (N321) has the final approval for all late exam 
requests but all SELRES late exam requests must come through the Navy 
Reserve Force ESOs prior to contacting NETPDC.  The Command ESO may e-
mail the Navy Reserve Force ESOs at 
CNRFC_Reserve_Forces_ESO(at)navy.mil and carbon copy their Immediate 
Superior in Commands ESO for validation of their late exam request.
Once the Reserve Force ESOs validate the reason of the request, the 
Command ESO will request approval from NETPDC to allow the Sailor to 
take the late exam.  A request for approval from NETPDC must be 
submitted with justification via e-mail to 
sfly_N321_exam_order(at)navy.mil for permission to retain exams for 
administration on the next drill weekend in October 2020.  Ensure the 
reason for a requested delay is included.
    h.  ESOs must verify the exam orders at the *View Previous Exam
Orders* link via the NEAS website within 7 to 10 days of placing the 
order.  If exam order discrepancies are noted, contact NETPDC (N321) 
as listed in the NEAS website at NETPDC (N321) Point of Contact Table.

4.  Exam administration and answer sheet returns
    a.  For exam administration and answer sheet return instructions, 
refer to chapter 6 of reference (a).
    b.  ESOs must check the exam tote board on the NEAS website often

processed successfully.
    c.  A detailed discrepancy list can be found at the NEAS website

    d.  Post-exam administration discrepancy correction correspondence 
with NETPDC (N321) is to be submitted using the EAW post-exam

All corrections must have CO/OIC letter and supporting documentation 
included as attachments.  Education point corrections require a

and date of completion.

due to assignment in CDCZ/ACOA, refer to chapter 6 of reference (a).
