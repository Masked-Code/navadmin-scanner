SUBJ/NAVY UNIFORM POLICY UPDATE// 
 
REF/A/DOC/COMNAVPERSCOM/1JAN03// 
AMPN/REF A IS NAVPERS 15665I, U.S. NAVY UNIFORM REGULATIONS.// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces an update to the Navy uniform policy.  Navy 
uniform policy updates directly support Sailor 2025 objectives to attract and 
retain the very best Sailors by finding greater flexibility in our policies 
and practices, including uniforms.  Navy uniform policy updates are the 
result of Fleet feedback, command sponsored requests and direction from Navy 
leadership.  This uniform policy update authorizes optional wear of the cold 
weather parka (CWP) rank insignia on Navy working uniform Type III (NWU Type 
III) components.  Approval of this policy change is based on the feedback 
received from the Fleet via the rank insignia wear evaluation, question of 
the day video responses regarding insignia options and ongoing complaints 
regarding the limited visibility of the camouflage pattern NWU Type III rank 
insignia. 
 
2.  Alternate NWU Type III Rank Insignia. 
    a.  Effective immediately, the CWP black slip-on rank insignia is 
authorized for optional wear on the NWU Type III parka, black fleece liner 
and shirt for E-4 through O-10 personnel unless otherwise prescribed for 
tactical operations and training.  When tactical operations or training 
requires complete camouflage wear, the NWU Type III camouflaged pattern rank 
insignia will be worn. 
        (1) Description.  The insignia consists of solid black fabric with 
color thread (gold, silver, scarlet) denoting the wearers rank.  The back of 
the insignia is sewn together in the center to form a loop which facilitates 
placement on the NWU Type III rank tab. 
        (2) Manner of wear.  Slide the insignia right side up on the rank tab 
of the NWU Type III parka, black fleece liner and shirt rank tab.
