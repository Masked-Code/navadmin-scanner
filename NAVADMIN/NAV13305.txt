RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the nomination process for the FY-13 
Language Professional of the Year (LPOY), Command Language Program of the 
Year (CLPOY), and Navy Linguist of the Year (LOY) programs per refs (a) 
through (c). 

2.  Each year, Navy recognizes the most outstanding Command Language Program 
(CLP), military and civilian language professionals, and non-career linguists 
who have contributed to mission success through the use of foreign language.  
The top Navy CLP and LPOY go on to compete at the DoD level.  DLIFLC manages 
the DoD program, which recognizes the most outstanding military language 
professional (E6 and below) and Command Language Programs across the military 
services.

3. Period of consideration for all programs is 1 October 2012 to 30 September 
2013.

4.  Categories, nomination criteria, and package requirements are provided in 
refs (a) and (b).  This year's essay topic for LPOY and LOY nominees is:  
"What are your best practices for maintaining or raising your language 
proficiency?"  Note:  This is to be an essay, NOT a research paper, i.e. no 
references or footnotes.

5.  Per ref (c), Navy may submit only one each nomination to DoD for LPOY and 
CLPOY.  Type Commanders (TYCOMs) and equivalent are requested to solicit 
nominations from subordinate units and submit the best candidate LPOY and 
CLPOY to the Navy Foreign Language Office (OPNAV N13F) for consideration.

6.  Refs (d) and (e) are available upon request or on-line via the Navy LREC 
webpage at http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/language_culture/pages/clpmcorner.aspx.

7.  Package submission:  Submit nomination packages by e-mail to the POC in 
paragraph II.  Packages without an endorsement from the TYCOM (or equivalent 
command) will not be considered.  Due to processing delays of traditional 
mail, hardcopy packages are not desired.  All e-mails containing personally 
identifiable Information (PII) must be encrypted.  Sending unencrypted emails 
containing PII is a reportable breach.

8.  Suspense:  LPOY and CLPOY nomination packages must be received by OPNAV 
N13F NLT 13 December 2013 to be considered.  LOY nomination packages must be 
received by OPNAV N13F NLT 17 January 2014 to be considered.

9.  E-mail ALTN_N13F1(at)navy.mil to request reference documents.

10.  Visit the Navy Personnel Command website for information on language and 
culture programs at http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/language_culture/Pages/default2.aspx.
