RMKS/1. Reference (a) provides additional guidance from Secretary of the Navy 
specific to the delegation of approval of Temporary Duty/Temporary Additional 
Duty (TDY/TAD) requests, contracts and changes in civilian government 
employee furlough status during the Federal Government shutdown. It is 
imperative that all commanders be cognizant of the rules set forth in 
references (b) and (c), and this message.

2. To ensure the Navy remains agile and retains full capability vital to our 
national security during the absence of available appropriations, per 
reference (a), the Chief of Naval Operations is delegating to 
Commanders/Budget Submitting Office
(BSO) of the following organizations the authority to approve, in writing, 
TDY/TAD travel that is in support of operations and activities as set forth 
in reference (c). This approval authority may not be further delegated, and 
all approvals must be in strict compliance with the guidance contained in 
references (a) through (c), regardless of funding source:

   a. Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command (BSO 60).
   b. Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet (BSO 70).
   c. Director, Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program (retains approval 
authority).
   d. Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Europe (retains approval authority).
   e. Director, Navy Staff (BSO 11).
   f. Chief of Naval Personnel (BSO 22).
   g. Commander, Navy Installations Command (BSO 52).
   h. Commander, Naval Air Systems Command (BSO 19).
   i. Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command (BSO 24).
   j. Chief, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BSO 18).
   k. Director, Strategic Systems Programs (BSO 30).

72).

3. For tracking purposes, Director, Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program will 
provide approved travel requests to BSO 24. Commander, U.S.
Naval Forces Europe will submit approved travel request to BSO 60.

4. To ensure proper review and tracking of all FY-14 travel expenditures 
during the current absence of appropriations, the following commands/BSO will 
route their travel requests to delegation authorities as listed below:

   a. Office of Naval Research (BSO 14): approval via Director, Navy Staff 
(BSO 11).
   b. Office of Naval Intelligence (BSO 15): approval via Director, Navy 
Staff (BSO 11).
   c. Naval Supply Systems Command (BSO 23): approval via Director, Navy 
Staff (BSO 11).
   d. Naval Facilities Engineering Command (BSO 25): approval via Commander, 
Navy Installations Command (BSO 52).
   e. Military Sealift Command (BSO 33): approval via Commander, U.S. Fleet 
Forces Command (BSO 60).
   f. Space and Naval Warfare Command (BSO 39): approval via Commander, Naval 
Sea Systems Command (BSO 24).
   g. Naval Education and Training Command (BSO 76):  approval via Chief of

5. U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Naval War College, and Naval Postgraduate School 
will route their travel requests via Chief of Naval Personnel (BSO 22).

6. All commands will route their travel requests as appropriate through the 
approval chain described above for tracking, review, and approval by one of 
the commands listed in paragraph 2. This routing approval process will 
continue until the Federal Government returns to normal operating status or 
superseded by additional guidance. 

7. All delegated TDY/TAD approving authorities specified in paragraph 2 shall 
keep an electronic file of authorized requests in order to answer official 
data calls and to facilitate a smooth transition back to normal operations 
once FY-14 appropriations are set. A data collection form has been made 
available by Director, Navy Staff to ease the administrative burden 
associated with this effort. At a minimum, ensure the following information 
is collected:

   a. Identification of personnel approved for travel.
   b. Estimated cost breakdown for proposed travel.
   c. Dates and locations of travel.
   d. Details of any additional contractual obligations associated with the 
travel request, and approval of obligations IAW reference (a).
   e. Accounting of the identified category of excepted activity IAW 
reference (b) and associated military operations IAW reference (c).

8. Inevitably, there will be travel requests that do not fit neatly into the 
promulgated guidance. Ultimately, it is expected that all commanders use 
their best judgment in verifying the legality (IAW established rules, 
regulations, and existing guidance) and appropriateness (in the context of 
the partial government shutdown) of each request prior to approval.

9. Points of contact: CAPT Vincent Martinez, Deputy DNS 
(Vincent.r.martinez1@navy.mil, (703) 692-9026) and LCDR Travis Overstreet, 
DNS-8 (travis.overstreet@navy.mil, (571) 256-9816).
