RMKS/1.  This message announces the schedule of informational briefings for 
upcoming Uniform National Discharge Standards (UNDS). 
 
1.  Background. 
    a.  In the upcoming months, Navy vessels (USS, USNS, combatant craft, 
service craft, boats, and any other artificial contrivance) will be required 
to comply with additional UNDS for the following eleven discharges: 
        (1) Catapult Water Brake Tank and Post-launch Retraction Exhaust 
        (2) Controllable Pitch Propeller Hydraulic Fluid 
        (3) Deck Runoff 
        (4) Firemain Systems 
        (5) Graywater 
        (6) Hull Coating Leachate 
        (7) Motor Gasoline Compensating Discharge 
        (8) Sonar Dome Discharge 
        (9) Submarine Bilgewater 
        (10) Surface Vessel Bilgewater/Oil-Water Separator 
        (11) Underwater Ship Husbandry 
    b.  These additional UNDS requirements will be implemented via a 
Department of Defense Instruction.  When that instruction is issued, another 
NAVADMIN will be promulgated to announce the issuance. 
    c.  Existing Navy operations should already comply with previous UNDS 
discharge standards and UNDS reporting, information logging, and record-
keeping responsibilities per references (a) and (b). 
    d.  UNDS regulations are federal regulations, based on the federal Clean 
Water Act.  It is imperative that all Navy vessels are in full compliance 
with these requirements as failure to comply could result in civil actions 
against the Navy or criminal prosecution. 
    e.  UNDS requirements may be enforced by U.S. Coast Guard or State 
officials.  If such officials request access to vessels or records, follow 
the procedures in reference (c), chapter 35, and coordinate with the Regional 
Environmental Coordinator. 
    f.  To assist commands in complying with the UNDS regulations, 
informational briefings will be provided as listed below.  Request 
appropriate personnel (person in charge, afloat environmental protection 
coordinators, maintenance, repair, operations) attend one of these sessions, 
as subject-matter experts will be on hand to answer questions.
