local food banks nationwide.

2.  Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) is designated as the Navy's 
lead organization for this initiative.  The FFF food drive is scheduled to 
run through 9 August 2019 and is an excellent opportunity for our Sailors and 
Civilians to support their communities.

3.  Concept of operations:

food banks if clearly contributing to the FFF campaign, stating "Department 
of the Navy contribution."
        (2) DoD has approved a dollar to food conversion rate for this year's 
FFF campaign of "$1 equals 3 lbs."
        (3) Receiving charities can include organizations such as community 
food banks, local Red Cross pantries, Salvation Army food kitchens and the 
like.
    b.  Navy commands are to designate a FFF command representative to 
coordinate this initiative with their nearest installation Chaplain.
    c.  FFF drop off and collection points are to be established throughout 
each Navy installation, by either the FFF command representative or 
installation Chaplain.
    d.  Each Monday, installation FFF representatives will collect weekly 
reports from their tenant command FFF representatives and report consolidated 
numbers (lbs) to region FFF Chaplains by close of business Tuesday.
    e.  Region Chaplains upload weekly progress report compiled from their 
subordinate units using the "2019 FFF Reporting Format Template," located at:
https://g2.cnic.navy.mil/tscnichq/RP/Chaplains/FFF/default.aspx.
    f.  The weekly report template includes the following info:
        (1) Command participation information (names, location).
        (2) Weight, in pounds, of food collected.
        (3) Food bank recipient, as applicable.

            (b) Individuals/teams to be recognized/thanked for participation.
