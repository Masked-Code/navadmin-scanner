RMKS/1.  This message announces Naval Research Working Group (NRWG) 19, from 
9 to 11 April 2019 at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), Monterey, CA.

2.  Per reference (a) (my.nps.edu/nrp/about), NRWG 19 will convene aboard NPS 
in order to provide operationally relevant research experiences to NPS 
faculty members; provide operationally relevant thesis opportunities to NPS 
students; and provide useful results from research projects and studies to 
topic sponsors across the Naval enterprise and in coordination with the Navy 
Analytic Office (NAO).

3.  NRWG 19 participants include individuals from Navy and Marine Corps 
agencies who have research or analysis needs, as well as NPS students, 
faculty, and staff.

4.  Topic sponsors should enter research topics in the topic portal on the 
NPS Naval Research Program (NRP) website ASAP, but no later than 22 March 
2019.  An NPS login ID or CAC card is required to log in.  The topic portal 
is located at my.nps.edu/nrp/topic-portal.

5.  The NRWG will result in the development of Initial Research Estimate 
Forms (IREFs).  These forms are forwarded to the Navy Topic Review Board 
(TRB) for vetting and validation.  The TRB will be coordinated via separate 
correspondence.

6.  Working group sessions begin 0730, 9 April 2019.  Travel days will be 
Monday and Friday, 8 and 12 April 2019 respectively.  For the detailed 
working group schedule, registration information, and other important admin 
details see the Naval Research Program website at my.nps.edu/nrp/nrwg-19.

7.  Conference exemption.  This working group has been designated a Title 10 
function and is therefore conference exempt.  Further, it has been formally 
vetted and meets the exemption criteria in Section IV, paragraph 4b of 
Department of Defense Conference Guidance 4.0, as an internal agency business 
matter.

8.  Released by Ms. Steffanie B. Easter, Director, Navy Staff.//
