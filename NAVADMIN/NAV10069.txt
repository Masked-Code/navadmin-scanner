SUBJ/FAMILY READINESS TRAINING//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE PLAN TO IMPLEMENT FAMILY READINESS 
EDUCATION INTO THE OFFICER AND ENLISTED TRAINING CONTINUUMS.

2.  FAMILY READINESS IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF MISSION READINESS.
EDUCATED, NETWORKED, RESILIENT FAMILIES POSITIVELY IMPACT EVERYTHING 
FROM OUR SAILORS' ABILITY TO FOCUS ON THE MISSION, TO QUALITY OF LIFE 
AND RETENTION.  IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT EACH OF OUR SAILORS IS 
INDOCTRINATED AND CONTINUOUSLY EDUCATED THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREERS ON THE 
SUPPORT SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES AND HOW TO 
UTILIZE THOSE SERVICES.  BY THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR, WE WILL 
SIMULTANEOUSLY INTEGRATE FAMILY READINESS EDUCATION INTO ALL PHASES OF 
OUR CONTINUUM OF TRAINING SPANNING FROM THE DELAYED ENTRY PROGRAM (DEP) 
TO SENIOR LEADERSHIP TRAINING.

3.  THE TRAINING PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE SCOPED AND TAILORED FAMILY 
READINESS EDUCATION APPROPRIATE TO CAREER MILESTONES THAT WILL 
CONTINUOUSLY BUILD AND REFRESH OUR SAILORS' KNOWLEDGE BASE AS THEY 
NAVIGATE THROUGH THEIR CAREERS AND ASSUME POSITIONS OF GREATER 
LEADERSHIP AND RESPONSIBILITY.  AS WE WORK TO INTEGRATE FAMILY 
READINESS INTO THE TRAINING CONTINUUM, WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE A 
VARIETY OF VENUES AND CHANNELS TO COMMUNICATE ESSENTIAL FAMILY SUPPORT 
INFORMATION TO OUR SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES.
