RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces changes to enlisted advancement policies 
within reference (a) with the goal to reward talented Sailors who show 
sustained superior performance.  This aligns with Sailor 2025 talent 
management initiatives by making changes to the current final multiple score 
(FMS) advancement process that add greater weight to performance measures.

2.  FMS updates and timeline.  The following changes have been made to the 
FMS and will be effective for E-4 through E-6 Selected Reserve (SELRES) 
candidates in the Navy-wide advancement exam (NWAE) February 2019 cycle 
(Cycle 104) and for E-4 through E-6 Active Duty (AD), Full-Time Support (FTS) 
and Canvasser Recruiter (CANREC) candidates in the March 2019 cycle (Cycle 
243).  The E-7 FMS will be updated for AD, FTS and CANREC chief petty officer 
candidates beginning with the January 2020 NWAE (Cycle 246) and for the 
February 2020 SELRES E-7 NWAE (Cycle 106).  Any Sailor who is competing for 
advancement in a past cycle will be scored with the FMS computation used 
during the missed cycle.  For example, Sailors who were unable to take an 
earlier exam or missed an exam while deployed to an approved operational area 
or Sailors who missed an exam through no fault of their own with approved 
exception to policy request or Board for Correction of Naval Records 
petition.
    a.  Performance Mark Average (PMA) for E-6 and E-7 Candidates.
Individual trait average (ITA) and reporting senior cumulative average (RSCA) 
will be used to determine RSCA PMA for Sailors competing for advancement for 
E-6 and E-7.  This change is intended to reward our most talented Sailors who 
display sustained superior performance.  The revised PMA computation process 
will be computed as follows:
        (1) Convert the *promotion recommendation* of all NAVPERS 1616/26, 
Evaluation Report and Counseling Record (E1-E6)
(active/inactive) in the respective paygrade, including frocked, for the 
computation period announced in the respective cycle NAVADMIN, to the value 
indicated in paragraph 308 of reference (a).  Refer to reference (b) for 
additional guidance on evaluations.  Evaluation reports are also accessible 
through the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) electronic 
service record (ESR) of the Sailor to arrive at the evaluation value (of 
4.00, 3.80, 3.60, 3.40 or 2.00).
        (2) For each evaluation within the PMA computation period, subtract 
the RSCA value from the ITA value.  If the difference is negative or 0.04 or 
less, no additional points are added to the evaluation value.  If the 
difference is 0.05 or more above RSCA, the additional RSCA calculation points 
as indicated below will be added to the evaluation value to get a RSCA 
evaluation value.  RSCA for evaluations from previous commands or reporting 
seniors can be found at NSIPS in the performance section under the 
FITREP/Evaluation link or at BUPERS Online (BOL) in the *ODC, OSR, PSR, ESR* 
section under the Evaluations Summary (1996 to present) link.

    POINTS ABOVE RSCA       ADDITIONAL RSCA CALCULATION POINTS
      0.05 to 0.19                         0.20
      0.20 to 0.34                         0.40
      0.35 to 0.49                         0.60
      0.50 to 0.64                         0.80
      0.65 to 0.79                         1.00
      0.80 to 0.94                         1.20
      0.95 to 1.09                         1.40
      1.10 to 1.24                         1.60
      1.25 or greater                      1.80

        (3) Each of the RSCA evaluation values will be added together and 
divided by the number of evaluations to get the RSCA PMA (rounded to two 
decimal places).
EXAMPLE:
EVAL 1:  EP; ITA = 4.71; RSCA = 3.77; POINTS ABOVE RSCA = 0.94 EVAL 2:  MP; 
ITA = 4.29; RSCA = 3.86; POINTS ABOVE RSCA = 0.43
EVAL 3:   P; ITA = 3.14; RSCA = 3.58; POINTS ABOVE RSCA = 0.00
RSCA EVAL1 = 4.00 + 1.20 = 5.20
RSCA EVAL2 = 3.80 + 0.60 = 4.40
RSCA EVAL3 = 3.60 + 0.00 = 3.60
RSCA PMA = (5.20 + 4.40 + 3.60)/3 = 4.40
Note:  The RSCA value for each evaluation will be a requirement for computing 
RSCA PMA.  If the RSCA value is missing for any of the evaluations in the PMA 
of the advancement cycle computation period, then RSCA PMA will be equal to 
0.00 and will be considered a discrepancy until resolved by the command.
        (4) A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet will be available on the Navy 
Enlisted Advancement System (NEAS) website at https://prod- 
neas.ncdc.navy.mil/ and the Navy Personnel Command (NPC) Career 
Administration Department (PERS-8031) page at
https://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/Advancement/Pages/default2.aspx.
Links to these websites can also be found in paragraph 7.  The spreadsheet 
will assist commands with the revised RSCA PMA calculation for candidates 
competing for E-6 advancement in the Spring 2019 cycles (Cycles 104 and 243).  
Accurate RSCA PMA calculations are vital to the selection and promotion of 
the right Sailors.  The RSCA PMA calculation will be included in the 
automated enlisted advancement worksheet (EAW) application starting with the 
Fall 2019 cycles (Cycles 105 and 244).  Prior to the automatic EAW 
application availability, commands shall ensure each manual RSCA PMA 
calculation performed by the educational services officer (ESO) and is 
verified by a second E-7 or above person (or the senior enlisted leader in 
commands that do not have E-7 or above personnel).
Note:  Active and Reserve candidates competing for advancement to chief petty 
officer will not use RSCA PMA until the 2020 advancement cycles.
    b.  Individual Augmentee (IA) Points.  Based on current operational 
requirements, the awarding of IA points for E-4 through
E-6 candidates will no longer be factored into the FMS score.  This change 
discontinues the awarding of IA points in references (c) and (d).
    c.  Pass Not Advanced (PNA) Points.  To reward superior rating knowledge, 
PNA points for E-4 through E-6 candidates will continue to be added when the 
FMS is computed.  However, in an effort to allow first time test takers an 
opportunity to compete on a more equal level, PNA points will continue to be 
awarded for the top 25 percent of eligible candidates but PNA points will 
only accumulate for the 3 previous advancement cycles.  Current PNA points 
from previous cycles will be retained.
    d.  Service in Paygrade (SIPG) Factor.  To reward experience, SIPG points 
for E-4 through E-6 candidates will continue to be added when the FMS is 
calculated.  However, in an effort to allow first time test takers an 
opportunity to compete on a more equal level, SIPG will be changed by 
dividing SIPG by 5 for eligible candidates.

3.  The revised FMS computations are summarized below:
    a.  E-4 and E-5 computations starting with Cycles 104 and 243:

4.  Responsibilities.  To ensure a fair, transparent and timely process for 
processing and determining RSCA PMA for our Sailors, the following reminder 
and administrative change to reference (b) applies:
    a.  Command leadership shall adhere to reference (b) timelines by 
promptly mailing evaluations within 15 days for AD, FTS and CANREC 
candidates, and 30 days for SELRES candidates, from the ending date of the 
evaluation.  This timeliness is critical to the ability of NPC to receive the 
evaluations, conduct the RSCA calculations and promptly update RSCAs into 
NSIPS ESR.  Evaluations sent outside these timelines must have a late letter 
justification attached.
    b.  Reporting seniors shall incorporate their post summary group
(PSG) RSCA score for E-5 and E-6 reports into evaluation Block 43, as a 
required admin comment, beginning the date of release of this NAVADMIN.  This 
will provide more transparency for our Sailors and will enable ESOs an 
ability to calculate RSCA PMA if RSCA is not available within NSIPS ESR.  In 
cases where the RSCA value documented in evaluation Block 43 differs from the 
RSCA provided by NSIPS after an evaluation has been accepted and processed by 
PERS-32, ESOs shall use the NSIPS ESR RSCA value when computing the RSCA PMA.

5.  Procedure for reporting seniors to calculate PSG RSCA (a Microsoft Excel 
spreadsheet will be available to assist commands with the PSG RSCA 
calculation):
  Step 1:  Log onto BOL at https://www.bol.navy.mil
  Step 2:  Click on CCA/FITREPS/Eval Reports
  Step 3:  Click on Reporting Seniors Cumulative Average Report
  Step 4:  If current paygrade RSCA is equal to Summary Group Average, place 
current RSCA on Block 43 of evaluation to finish this procedure
  Step 5:  If current paygrade RSCA is not equal to Summary Group Average, 
then continue with procedures below to determine new PSG RSCA
  Step 6:  Click on appropriate paygrade, E-5 or E-6
  Step 7:  Scroll to bottom of list and identify Total Trait Count and Total 
Trait Sum
  Step 8: Identify the total trait count and total trait sum for your current 
summary group
  Step 9: Add the two total trait count numbers together
  Step 10: Add the two total trait sum numbers together
  Step 11: Divide the new total trait sum by the new total trait count to get 
new PSG RSCA
  Step 12: Insert new RSCA into Block 43 of evaluation
Example:
Current RSCA for E-5 has a total trait count of 124 and the total trait sum 
is 594 for a current RSCA of 4.79 (rounded to two decimal places).  New 
summary group has three Sailors being evaluated as
follows:
  Sailor 1:  6 traits; 5,4,4,4,5,4 = trait sum of 26
  Sailor 2:  6 traits; 4,4,4,4,4,4 = trait sum of 24
  Sailor 3:  6 traits; 4,4,3,3,4,3 = trait sum of 21 For a total trait count 
of 18 (6+6+6) and a total trait sum of 71 (26+24+21).  Summary Group of three 
Sailors being evaluated is 3.94.
Combine the two trait counts (124+18 = 142) Combine the two trait sums 
(594+71 = 665) Divide 665 by 142 to get new PSG RSCA of 4.68 (rounded to two 
decimal places).  Sample entry for block 43:  PSG RSCA:  4.68.
Refer to reference (b) for additional guidance on evaluations.

6.  To allow sufficient time to manually process all documents (evaluation 
reports and RSCA information) during advancement worksheet verification, 
command leadership is responsible for ensuring all Sailors, ESOs and command 
career counselors are familiar with these updates.

7.  Points of contact and links.
