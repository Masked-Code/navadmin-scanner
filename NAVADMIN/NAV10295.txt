RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES GUIDANCE TO COMMANDERS AND COMMANDING OFFICERS
(CO'S) ON OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS IN SUPPORT OF FAMILY READINESS.

2.  FAMILY READINESS IS A CORNERSTONE OF WARFIGHTING READINESS.
EFFECTIVE FAMILY SUPPORT AND QUALITY OF LIFE PROGRAMS ENHANCE OUR 
SAILORS' ABILITY TO SUPPORT OUR NATION'S MILITARY COMMITMENTS.  OUR 
SAILORS AND FAMILIES MUST BE KEPT INFORMED OF AVAILABLE SERVICES AND 
PROGRAMS SYSTEMS AND HOW TO ACCESS AND USE THEM.  ACCORDINGLY, WE MUST 
HAVE A COMMUNICATION STRATEGY THAT DELIVERS ACCURATE, TIMELY AND 
RESPONSIVE INFORMATION TO SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

3.  FAMILY READINESS IS A CO'S RESPONSIBILITY, INDEPENDENT OF THE 
SAILOR.
COMMAND AUTHORITIES MAY CONTACT FAMILY MEMBERS, WITH OR WITHOUT THE 
SPONSOR'S CONSENT, WHEN RELAYING OFFICIAL INFORMATION DIRECTLY RELATED 
TO FAMILY READINESS.

4.  OFFICIAL FAMILY READINESS INFORMATION INCLUDES INFORMATION RELATED 
TO SUPPORT SERVICES AND SOCIAL, INFORMATIONAL, CARE-TAKING, AND MORALE-
BUILDING ACTIVITIES AIMED AT ENHANCING PREPAREDNESS FOR THE TOTAL NAVY 
FAMILY COMMUNITY.
FOR EXAMPLE, CO'S CAN DISSEMINATE UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION REGARDING 
SCHEDULES, COMMAND POINTS OF CONTACT, LOCATION AND AVAILABILITY OF 
FAMILY SERVICE RESOURCES, AND MUSTERING AND ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES FOR 
EXERCISES AND REAL-WORLD EMERGENCIES.
CO'S CAN ALSO DISSEMINATE INFORMATION DESIGNED TO EDUCATE SAILORS AND 
FAMILIES CONCERNING THE LOCAL AND MILITARY COMMUNITY, MILITARY PAY AND 
ALLOWANCES, FINANCIAL PLANNING, EMERGENCYPREPAREDNESS, AND VOLUNTEER 
OPPORTUNITIES WITH NAVY-AFFILIATED SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS (E.G., NAVY-
MARINE CORPS RELIEF SOCIETY).

5.  CO'S, AND OTHER DESIGNATED COMMAND MEMBERS, CAN PERSONALLY 
COMMUNICATE WITH FAMILIES.  CO'S CAN ALSO LEVERAGE THE RESOURCES OF 
EXISTING READINESS AFFILIATED PROGRAMS SUCH AS OMBUDSMEN AND FLEET AND 
FAMILY SUPPORT CENTERS. THE COMMAND OMBUDSMAN, FORMALLY APPOINTED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH REF C, NAVY FAMILY OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM, HOLDS OFFICIAL 
COMMAND STATUS AND SERVES AS THE CO'S PRIMARY ADVISOR AND ASSISTANT IN 
ENSURING FAMILIES HAVE THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO MEET THE CHALLENGES 
OF A MILITARY LIFE.  THE COMMAND OMBUDSMAN CAN USE COMMAND RECALL 
ROSTERS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF DUTIES TO DISSEMINATE OFFICIAL FAMILY 
READINESS INFORMATION.

6.  TO ENSURE SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE AWARE OF FAMILY SUPPORT 
PROGRAMS, WE MUST USE THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE MEANS AT OUR 
DISPOSAL.  ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, INCLUDING SOCIAL MEDIA, E-
MAIL AND WEBSITES, OFFER A STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL ADVANTAGE BY ENABLING 
THE INSTANTANEOUS POSTING OF INFORMATION TO A LARGE AUDIENCE CONCERNING 
AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON LIFE, HEALTH, WORK, 
CAREER,FINANCES AND COMMUNITY.

7.  CO'S ARE PERMITTED TO COLLECT AND MAINTAIN PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE 
INFORMATION (PII)(HOME ADDRESS, MAILING ADDRESS, PRIVATE PHONE NUMBERS, 
PERSONAL E-MAIL ADDRESS,AND NAMES OF FAMILY MEMBERS) TO PROPERLY 
ACCOUNT FOR SAILORS AND FAMILY MEMBERS DURING ROUTINE OR EMERGENCY 
SITUATIONS AND FOR PURPOSES OF DISSEMINATING OFFICIAL FAMILY READINESS 
INFORMATION.

8.  CO'S MUST PROTECT PII AT ALL TIMES.  PERSONAL INFORMATION OBTAINED 
OR MAINTAINED THROUGH OFFICIAL SOURCES MAY NOT BE USED FOR UNOFFICIAL 
PURPOSES.  UNOFFICIAL INFORMATION SUCH AS COMMERCIAL VENTURES, 
ADVERTISEMENTS,PRIVATE SOLICITATIONS, FUNDRAISING ACTIVITIES, AND 
BIRTHDAY WISHES, MAY NOT BE DISSEMINATED THROUGH OFFICIAL COMMUNICATION 
NETWORKS.  WITHOUT PRIOR CONSENT, CO'S MAY NOT RELEASE PERSONAL CONTACT 
INFORMATION TO INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES OUTSIDE THE COMMAND, INCLUDING 
SPOUSE CLUBS OR FAMILY READINESS GROUPS.  A PERMISSIBLE MANAGEMENT 
PRACTICE IS FOR THE MEMBER TO INDICATE AS PART OF THE CHECK-IN PROCESS 
WHETHER THEY, OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBER/SPOUSE, CONSENTS TO RELEASING 
FAMILY CONTACT INFORMATION TO EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR PURPOSES OF 
RECEIVING INFORMATION REGARDING EVENTS AND FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAMS.  TO 
ENSURE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE PERSONALLY AWARE OF THE BENEFITS OF QUICK, 
DIRECT COMMUNICATION, THE CHECK-IN MAY REQUIRE EVIDENCE OF FAMILY 
MEMBER NOTIFICATION CONSENT AND DECISION.

9.  OFFICIAL DATABASES CONTAINING PII MAY NOT BE USED TO IDENTIFY 
SAILORS OR FAMILY MEMBERS BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCE OR STATUS (E.G., 
MEDICAL, RELIGIOUS, FINANCIAL OR FAMILY SITUATION) FOR TARGETED CONTACT 
THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN INVASION OF PRIVACY.  CO'S AND FAMILY SUPPORT 
ORGANIZATIONS MUST COMMUNICATEIN A MANNER THAT RESPECTS  THE PRIVACY OF 
FAMILIES, AVOIDING GROUP EMAILS THAT REVEAL PRIVATE INFORMATION.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, CO'S CAN NOT RELEASE DATA OF ALL FAMILIES WHO RECEIVED 
FINANCIAL COUNSELING THROUGH THE FLEET AND FAMILY SERVICE CENTER.

10.  GUIDANCE ON THE PRIVACY ACT, OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM, AND FRGS IS 
OUTLINED IN REFS A THROUGH E.  CO'S SHOULD CONSULT WITH ASSIGNED STAFF  
JUDGE ADVOCATES OR GENERAL COUNSEL ATTORNEYS IF QUESTIONS ARISE 
REGARDING TO THIS POLICY.
