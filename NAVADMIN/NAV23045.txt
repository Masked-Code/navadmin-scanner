RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the continuation of the Surface 
Warfare Officer (SWO) Lieutenant Commander (LCDR) Retention Bonus 
(LRB) for eligible SWOs. 
 
2.  Program Authority.  In line with reference (a), the SWO LRB is 
effective through 30 September 2025 unless otherwise rescinded or 
superseded.  This program is authorized in line with section 332 of 
reference (b).  All applications for the bonus contained within this 
program will be submitted to the SWO Assignments Division (PERS-41) 
for approval, payment processing, and tracking. 
 
3.  Program Overview.  This NAVADMIN summarizes the provisions of 
the SWO LRB.  All information provided herein is applicable to both 
Active Component (AC) SWO personnel and Training and Administration 
of the Reserve (TAR) SWO personnel, except where otherwise noted. 
The following general summary is provided: 
    a.  SWOs promoted to LCDR will have the opportunity to commit to 
the SWO LRB.  The Navy will pay qualified officers for 3 years of 
obligated service from their 12th year of commissioned service (YCS) 
through the completion of their 15th YCS.  LCDRs with at least 11 
YCS, but not more than 12 YCS, are eligible for the SWO LRB.  AC 
SWOs will receive $22K on the second anniversary, $12K on the third 
anniversary, and $12K on the fourth anniversary of their promotion 
to LCDR.  In line with references (a) and (b), TAR SWOs will receive 
$12K on the second, third, and fourth anniversaries of their 
promotion to LCDR. 
    b.  References (b) and (c) limit career retention bonus amounts. 
While officers may receive multiple retention bonuses under section 
332 of reference (b) over a career, total bonus payments under this 
authority may not exceed $300K for AC officers and $150K for TAR 
officers. 
 
4.  Program Eligibility: 
    a.  Must meet all four of the following requirements: 
        (1) Qualified and serving as an Active Duty SWO (designator 
1110 or 1117). 
        (2) Permanently appointed LCDR. 
        (3) Have at least 11 YCS, but no more than 12 YCS. 
        (4) Completed two afloat department head tours or a single 
longer tour in line with the department head sequencing plan as 
assigned by PERS-41. 
    b.  If assigned to an at-sea tour by PERS-41, eligible officers 
must be sea duty assignable as defined by reference (d). 
Additionally: 
        (1) An officer under contract assigned to an at-sea tour and 
evaluated as no longer fit for sea duty by an appropriate medical 
authority, following a period of temporary limited duty (TLD), will 
have a stop payment placed on their account and receive no further 
SWO LRB payments.  However, an officer on TLD who is reasonably 
expected by the assigned medical officer to make a full recovery and 
be found fit for sea duty will continue to receive scheduled 
payments.  This determination will be completed by PERS-41 in line 
with the appropriate medical authority's findings. 
        (2) An officer found unfit for continued naval service by an 
appropriate medical authority will have a stop payment placed on 
their account and receive no further SWO LRB payments. 
        (3) Should a previously ineligible officer later become fit 
for sea duty, payments will resume at normal intervals for the 
remainder of the anniversary payment(s).  Retroactive pay is not 
authorized for any bonus payments that were scheduled during the 
period the officer was ineligible. 
    c.  Career Intermission Program (CIP).  An officer participating 
in CIP will be ineligible to receive LRB payments during their time 
in the program.  Payments will resume upon return to service and in 
line with the payment scheme. 
    d.  An officer is not eligible to receive both the SWO 
Department Head Retention Bonus and LRB concurrently. 
 
5.  Program Execution: 
    a.  The SWO community manager is assigned as the program manager 
and is delegated the authority to administer the SWO LRB program in 
line with applicable laws, Department of Defense directives, and 
this NAVADMIN. 
    b.  PERS-41 receives applications submitted in the format 
referenced in paragraph 7.  PERS-41 is delegated the authority to: 
        (1) Evaluate the eligibility of SWOs applying for the SWO 
LRB program. 
        (2) Approve SWO contracts to remain on Active Duty for the 
stated period in exchange for a SWO LRB. 
        (3) Administer LRB payments. 
    c.  All applications require written endorsement from their 
commander, commanding officer (CO), or equivalent superior in 
charge. 
    d.  Officers under a LRB agreement are not eligible to apply for 
the permanent military instructor (PMI) program, or any 
redesignation programs resulting in a designator change to any 
designator other than 1110 or 1117.  An officer under a LRB 
agreement may submit an application for PMI or any redesignation 
programs once the date of application is within 12 months of the 
final day of bonus obligation. 
 
6.  LRB Payment Structure: 
    a.  Applications for LRB must be submitted between the 11th and 
12th YCS.  Approved applicants will receive payments on the second, 
third, and fourth anniversary of their promotion to LCDR.  For 
example, an officer who elects not to apply (or is not eligible) for 
LRB bonus before their second anniversary of promotion to LCDR, but 
between their second and third-anniversary elects (or becomes 
eligible) to apply, will receive a payment for their third 
anniversary and will have forgone their second-anniversary payment 
altogether.  The same logic also applies to officers deemed 
ineligible for the LRB bonus during one payment period, but who 
subsequently become eligible during another period.  The following 
table describes the schedule: 
LCDR promotion anniversary       Payment 
Second                           $22K for AC 
                                 $12K for TAR 
Third                            $12K for AC and TAR 
Fourth                           $12K for AC and TAR 
    b.  In the case of officers who promote to LCDR below zone, 
PERS-41 may alter the payment schedule to ensure high performing- 
officers are eligible to receive the full bonus amount. 
 
7.  Application Process: 
    a.  General Notes: 
        (1) Application format can be found on the PERS-41 page of 
the Navy Personnel Command website at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
Management/Detailing/Officer/Pers-41-SWO/Pay-Incentives/. 
        (2) Applications will be binding upon the date of approval 
by PERS-41. 
        (3) Applications received in the incorrect format or not 
meeting eligibility requirements defined in this NAVADMIN will be 
rejected. 
    b.  Officers must mail the signed original agreement and COs 
endorsement to: 
        Commander, Navy Personnel Command (PERS-41) 
        PERS-411/SWO LRB 
        5720 Integrity Drive 
        Millington, TN 38055 
    c.  Additionally, a copy of the signed original contract and COs 
endorsement should be submitted by e-mail to the applicable 
assignment officer and/or civilian assistant. 
 
8.  Recoupment and Repayment Policy.  Repayment policy is governed 
by section 373 of reference (b) and reference (e).  A Service Member 
of the uniformed services who enters into a written agreement with 
specified service conditions for receipt of a bonus is entitled to 
the full amount of the bonus if the Service Member fulfills the 
conditions of the written agreement.  If the Service Member fails to 
fulfill the service conditions specified in the written agreement 
for the pay, then the pay may be terminated and the Service Member 
may be required to repay an amount equal to the unearned portion of 
the pay.  SWO LRB payments will be stopped for officers who become 
ineligible for this incentive or fail to complete the full period of 
additional obligated service. 
    a.  For officers who die while serving under a SWO LRB service 
agreement, the remaining SWO LRB balance will be paid as a lump sum 
as part of the settlement of the final military pay account of the 
officer.  If death is determined to be the result of the misconduct 
of the member, future payments will be stopped and unearned portions 
of the bonus will be recouped, as applicable, in line with 
procedures established for members whose inability to complete a 
contracted period of service is voluntary or the result of 
misconduct. 
    b.  Recoupment exception to policy determinations will be made 
by Director, Military Personnel Plans and Policy (OPNAV N13). 
 
9.  Additional guidance, information, and updates regarding the SWO 
LRB are available at the MyNavy HR website,
