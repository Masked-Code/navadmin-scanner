SUBJ/NAVY BIRTHDAY 2012//

RMKS/1.  AS WE CELEBRATE OUR NAVAL HERITAGE ON OUR 237TH BIRTHDAY 13 OCTOBER, 
WE PROUDLY REFLECT ON MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES OF WARFIGHTING EXCELLENCE AS THE 
WORLD'S PREEMINENT MARITIME FORCE.

2.  WE HAD AN EXTREMELY BUSY YEAR ANSWERING OUR NATION'S CALLS TO OPERATE 
FORWARD - AND LIKE THOSE SAILORS THAT CAME BEFORE US, WE ASSURED ALLIES, 
PROJECTED POWER, AND DEFENDED OUR NATION'S INTERESTS AROUND THE GLOBE.  THIS 
PAST YEAR ALSO SIGNIFIED A LANDMARK YEAR FOR OUR NAVY AS WE COMMEMORATED THE 
WAR OF 1812.
200 YEARS AGO, ON THE GREAT LAKES, ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD, AND WATERS OF 
NEW ORLEANS, OUR LEGACY WAS FORGED AND TRADITIONS WERE MADE.

3.  WE CAN NEVER FORGET THE SAILORS WHO FOUGHT IN 1812 AND WHAT WE LEARNED.  
THEY WERE BRAVE AND INNOVATIVE SAILORS WITH AN AMAZING WARFIGHTING SPIRIT.  
THEY MADE US WHAT WE ARE TODAY, AND THEIR SPIRIT AND SELF-SACRIFICE LIVE ON IN 
OUR BOLD, PROFICIENT AND CONFIDENT SAILORS.

4.  AS WE START THIS NEW YEAR TOGETHER, I ASK YOU TO REMEMBER OUR TENETS:  
WARFIGHTING FIRST, OPERATE FORWARD, AND BE READY.
WE MUST BE READY TO FIGHT AND WIN TODAY, WHILE BUILDING THE ABILITY TO WIN 
TOMORROW.  WE MUST PROVIDE OFFSHORE OPTIONS TO DETER, INFLUENCE, AND WIN IN AN 
ERA OF UNCERTAINTY.  FINALLY, WE MUST HARNESS THE TEAMWORK, TALENT, AND 
IMAGINATION OF OUR DIVERSE FORCE TO BE READY TO FIGHT AND RESPONSIBLY EMPLOY 
OUR RESOURCES.

5.  HAPPY 237TH BIRTHDAY SHIPMATES!  I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD OF OUR SAILORS, 
CIVILIAN WORK FORCE, AND FAMILIES.  I AM GRATEFUL TO BE YOUR SHIPMATE AND A 
PART OF THE GREATEST NAVY THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN.

6.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL JONATHAN W. GREENERT, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.
