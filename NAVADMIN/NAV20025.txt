SUBJ/RE-ESTABLISHING NAVY LEADER DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK BRIEFS//

REF/A/DOC/CNO/7MAY2019//
REF/B/NAVADMIN/CNO/9MAR2017//
NARR/REF A IS CNO DOCUMENT, NAVY LEADER DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK 3.0.
REF B IS NAVY LEADER DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.//

RMKS/1.  The Navy Leader Development Framework (NLDF) 3.0 outlines how the 
U.S. Navy will develop leaders who demonstrate operational excellence 
(competence), high ideals of integrity and service (character) at every level 
of seniority, all the while expanding and enhancing trust and confidence 
(connections).  This NAVADMIN provides direction for implementation of 
reference (a) and cancels previous guidance in reference (b).

2.  Renewed Great Power Competition requires we accelerate our leader 
development efforts.  Community leads, listed below, will update their 
strategies and continuums to develop leaders up to the Command Senior 
Enlisted Leader (CSEL) and major command levels.
Each community lead will brief their leader development continuum to the 
Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) or Vice Chief of Naval Operations (VCNO) 
semi-annually.

3.  After 2 years of implementing the Leader Development Framework, there are 
many best practices to discuss and share.  The Naval War College (NWC), with 
the assistance of the Naval Leadership and Ethics Center (NLEC), will 
continue to support community leads and develop and maintain a strategy for 
Navy-wide leader development beyond major command, with support from Flag 
Matters (N00F).  The Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (MCPON) will 
maintain a strategy for CSEL development, with support from NWC.  The 21st 
Century Sailor Office (OPNAV N17), the lead for Inclusion and Diversity (I 
and D), will provide I and D core competencies and goals and objectives, 
which are required to be incorporated into all leader development strategies.

4.  Holistically, NLDF briefings will facilitate frank conversations between 
community leads and Navy leadership on how the latest in decision science and 
team development is employed across all three leader development lanes 
outlined in reference (a) and below.  NLDF community briefs should 
incorporate the following to demonstrate progress in achieving both a Culture 
of Excellence and leader development outcomes:
    a.  Competence:  Producing operational experts
        (1) Community leader development strategy
        (2) Officer, enlisted and civilian leadership development continuum
        (3) Use of assessments to gauge leader development continuum
        (4) Community initiatives and way ahead
        (5) Efforts to integrate decision science into leader development
    b.  Character:  Espousing our Core Values of Honor, Courage and 
Commitment
        (1) Initiatives that demonstrate infusion of character building 
throughout a Sailors career progression
        (2) A focus on how inclusive leaders build better teams and make 
better decisions
        (3) Pursuits to develop ethical leaders
    c.  Connection:  Develop levels of common understanding and a sense of 
identity and belonging for team members
        (1) Community-specific I and D goals and objectives
        (2) Community demographic data:  composition by rank, trends, 
promotion stats, career milestones and retention
        (3) Community best practices and challenges
        (4) Coaching, mentoring and advocacy efforts.  Activities which also 
drive competence and character, and ultimately, higher team performance
        (5) Efforts to integrate human factors, primary prevention and 
Command Resilience Team fundamentals into leader development
        (6) Talent management efforts to deliberately track and develop high 
potential diverse talent, barriers to overcome to retain talent and 
initiatives to promote engagement

6.  The Leader Development Continuum Council (LDCC) for the Navy, led by the 
President NWC, is an excellent forum to hold energized discussions on leader 
development.  The LDCC meets on a monthly basis and provides an opportunity 
for community leads to share best practices and provide feedback on proposed 
leader development strategies and programs.
