SUBJ/JUNETEENTH HOLIDAY OBSERVANCE//

REF/A/DOC/OPM/17JUN2021//

NARR/REF A is memorandum released by Kathleen McGettigan, Acting Director of 
OPM.

RMKS/ 1. POTUS signed a bill establishing Juneteenth as a federal holiday, 
which commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. IAW reference 
(a), we will observe the holiday on Friday, 18 June 2021.

2. Juneteenth celebrates the emancipation of the last enslaved African 
Americans. On that day in 1865, Union soldiers led by Gen. Gordon Granger 
arrived in the coastal city of Galveston, Texas, to deliver General Order No.
3, officially ending slavery in the state. The final act of liberation came 
months after the Confederate Army's surrender ended the Civil War, and more 
than two years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation 
Proclamation.
