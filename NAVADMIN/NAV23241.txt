RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a) and provides guidance for the 
Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) Cybersecurity Awareness Challenge (CAC) training 
requirement. 
 
2.  Per references (b) and (c), Navy personnel, civilians, and contractors 
with access to unclassified or classified networks must complete the 
Department of Defense (DoD) employee version of CAC by 1 September 2024. 
 
3.  Personnel who completed CAC 2023 after 30 September 2023 but before CAC 
2024 is available shall receive credit for their annual FY24 training. 
 
4.  Total Workforce Management Services (TWMS) is the readiness platform used 
to track CAC completion percentages for the U.S. Navy. Commands and training 
platforms must confirm TWMS is capturing all CAC completions under the 
overarching requirement ID set by Commander, Navy Installations Command 
(CNIC)/TWMS Administration (TWMS Requirement ID:  74793 - FY24 DoD Cyber 
Awareness Challenge) to receive credit.  Commands are prohibited from 
creating additional CAC training requirements to set command specific 
training metrics. This requirement cannot be waived.  These options below are 
the authorized methods for training delivery: 
    a.  Commands can elect to complete CAC training using instructor-led 
delivery.  A command designated cyber security professional such as the 
Information Systems Security Manager (ISSM) or Cyber Workforce Program 
Manager (CWF-PM) must provide the instruction. 
    b.  Total Workforce Management Service, https://twms.dc3n.navy.mil/; 
    c.  Navy e-Learning (NEL), https://learning.nel.navy.mil/; (Note: 
The My Navy Portal, https://learning.nel.navy.mil/ELIAASv2p/ 
(redirects users to the NEL link)); 
    d.  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) website, 
https://cyber.mil/training/cyber-awareness-challenge/; 
    e.  Waypoints, https://don.csod.com/samldefault.aspx; 
    f.  Other approved training sources, DISA Digital Video Discs (DVDs). 
 
5.  Ships can access the annual training from the NEL application hosted on 
the Navy Information/Application Product Suite (NIAPS) server, eliminating 
the need to reach back to shore hosted NEL websites.  The CAC 2024 course is 
available via the NEL Afloat Learning Management System Pub Amendment 112 for 
download by the NIAPS Administrator using the normal manual NIAPS distance 
support update process.  If unable to download Learning Management System Pub 
Amendment 112, ships can request a DVD with these files to be mailed by 
submitting a support request to Navy 311. 
 
6.  Although CAC training is an individual responsibility, commanders and 
commanding officers are accountable for 100 percent completion of their 
personnel.  Effective 1 September 2020, the DoD Cybersecurity Hardening 
Scorecard collects information on the number of users who completed annual 
Cybersecurity Awareness training and scorecard is briefed on a quarterly 
basis to the Deputy Secretary of Defense.  Training officers are responsible 
for ensuring their personnel complete and properly document the required 
training. 
 
7.  Command training officers must validate training via TWMS or Fleet 
Training Management and Planning System (FLTMPS) 
(https://ntmpsweb.ncdc.navy.mil) authoritative databases. 
Training officers will manually record training completed via the DISA 
website, DISA DVDs, or instructor-led.  Manually record training in FLTMPS 
using the Learning Event Completion Form.  Report any discrepancies to the 
Navy Training Management Planning System Operational Support office at 
ntmps.support(AT)navy.mil or (866) 438-2898/DSN 922-1867. 
 
8.  The Command ISSM is responsible for reporting compliance to meet Federal 
Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 requirements. 
Command ISSMs will disable accounts of users who do not complete training by 
1 September 2024 and maintain non-compliance list of accounts that were 
disabled. 
 
9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded. 
 
10.  Released by Ms. Jennifer Edgin, Assistant Deputy Chief of Naval 
Operations for Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
