RMKS/1.  The purpose of this NAVADMIN is to direct and define the actions 
required to implement the provisions of reference (a) to consolidate Navy 
Permanent Change of Station (PCS) lodging (Navy Lodge) and Navy Temporary 
Duty (TDY) lodging (Navy Gateway Inns & Suites (NGIS)) under the operational 
control of Navy Exchange Service Command (NEXCOM) and to change command and 
control of NGIS from Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), as 
delineated in reference (b), to NEXCOM.  NEXCOM will achieve initial 
operational capability (IOC) by 1 October 2021 and full operational 
capability (FOC) by 30 September 2022. 
 
2.  Scope.  This NAVADMIN applies Navy-wide to all NGIS regardless of 
supported mission.  No NGIS are exempted from this consolidation. 
 
 
3.  Action. 
    a.  Per reference (c), Commander, Naval Supply Systems Command 
(COMNAVSUPSYSCOM) is designated program manager for Navy Lodges and has 
delegated technical management responsibility to NEXCOM.  Navy Lodge will 
remain under the technical management of NEXCOM.  Effective 1 October 2021, 
COMNAVSUPSYSCOM is designated as program manager for NGIS and, per reference 
(a), technical management for NGIS is delegated to NEXCOM. 
    b.  To reflect the change in NGIS command and control, Deputy Chief of 
Naval Operations Fleet Readiness and Logistics (CNO N4) shall update 
applicable OPNAV instructions, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery shall update 
NAVMED P-5010-2, and Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command 
(NAVFACENGSYSCOM) shall update UFC 4-720-01. 
 
4.  Responsibilities. 
    a.  Effective immediately, NEXCOM, under the program management and 
administrative control of COMNAVSUPSYSCOM, shall: 
        (1) Collaborate closely with CNIC in the transition of NGIS command 
and control from CNIC to NEXCOM; and 
        (2) In collaboration with CNIC, identify common support services CNIC 
provides to NGIS for matters including, but not limited to, payroll support, 
financial oversight, human resources support, and other similar common 
support services and accept in writing responsibility for those services from 
CNIC no later than 30 September 2022. 
    b.  Effective 1 October 2021, NEXCOM, under the program management and 
administrative control of COMNAVSUPSYSCOM, shall: 
        (1) Provide management, control, and performance oversight of NGIS 
facilities and services as outlined in references (d) through (g).  Common 
support services provided to NGIS shall be discontinued by CNIC and thereupon 
initiated by NEXCOM per subparagraph 4a(2) and subparagraph 4c(2); 
        (2) Formulate and recommend legislative proposals regarding lodging 
for submittal by the Chief of Naval Operations to the Secretary of the Navy 
as deemed necessary and appropriate; 
        (3) Conduct customer and employee surveys; 
        (4) Collaborate with NAVFACENGSYSCOM to formulate and recommend 
facility construction, leasing, and other acquisition programs to meet NGIS 
lodging requirements; 
        (5) Develop and coordinate NGIS lodging guidance; 
        (6) Conduct and evaluate service improvement programs; 
        (7) Prepare long term capital plans based on DOD adequacy standards, 
facility condition, occupancy, and resulting required room rates compared to

        (8) Prepare budgets to support NGIS requirements; 
        (9) Collaborate with NAVFACENGSYSCOM to determine if current Unified 
Facilities Criteria meets future needs; 
        (10) Establish criteria and standards for plans, design, 
construction, and maintenance of NGIS lodging facilities; 
        (11) Manage, maintain, and operate NGIS lodging programs and related 
collateral facilities; 
        (12) Provide staff training and written operational guidance; and 
        (13) Achieve and report full operational capability of the 
consolidation of PCS and TDY lodging programs under the command and control 
of NEXCOM no later than 30 September 2022.  If, in the judgment of NEXCOM, 
FOC requires disestablishment of any nonappropriated fund instrumentality 
(NAFI), or establishment of any NAFI, NEXCOM shall make a timely request to 
CNO for such action per reference (d). 
    c.  Effective immediately, CNIC shall: 
        (1) Collaborate with NEXCOM to effect the transition of NGIS command 
and control from CNIC to NEXCOM effective 1 October 2021; 
        (2) Continue to provide common support services to NGIS on a 
reimbursable basis for matters including, but not limited to, payroll 
support, financial oversight, human resources support, and other similar 
common support services, as identified per subparagraph 4a(2), until such 
time as NEXCOM accepts in writing responsibility to provide those support 
services to NGIS; and 
        (3) Support NEXCOM in transferring command and control of NGIS from 
CNIC to NEXCOM to achieve the lodging consolidation IOC and FOC dates 
directed by reference (a).
