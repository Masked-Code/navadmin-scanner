SUBJ/ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PERMANENT MILITARY PROFESSOR COMMUNITY//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ESTABLISHES THE PERMANENT MILITARY PROFESSOR
(PMP) COMPETITIVE CATEGORY IN THE RESTRICTED LINE, DESIGNATOR 1230.

2.  PMPS ARE CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO THE SPECIAL DUTY OFFICER (HUMAN
RESOURCES) COMPETITIVE CATEGORY, DESIGNATOR 1200.  HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES 
IN REQUIREMENTS FOR PMPS AND FOR THE CORE HUMAN RESOURCE
(HR) OFFICERS IN THE 1200 DESIGNATOR MAKE MANAGEMENT OF STRENGTH AND 
PROMOTION PLANNING INEFFICIENT.  CREATION OF THE 1230 DESIGNATOR WILL 
RESULT IN MORE PREDICTABLE AND REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS FOR PROMOTION.

3.  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PMP COMPETITIVE CATEGORY WILL OCCUR BY 30 
SEPTEMBER 2009 WITH DESIGNATOR CONVERSION OF ALL CURRENT PMPS AND 
PERSONNEL IN TRAINING TO BECOME PMPS.  BEGINNING IN OCTOBER 2009, 
DESIGNATORS FOR ALL PMP BILLETS AT THE NAVAL ACADEMY, NAVAL WAR COLLEGE, 
AND NAVAL POST GRADUATE SCHOOL, AS WELL AS ALL PMP STUDENT BILLETS WILL 
BE CHANGED FROM 1200 TO 1230.  DESIGNATOR CHANGES WILL BE MADE VIA THE 
TOTAL FORCE MANPOWER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (TFMMS) CONDUCTED BY THE 
COGNIZANT BUDGET SUBMITTING OFFICE (BSO) IN COORDINATION WITH THE HR 
OFFICER COMMUNITY MANAGER.

4.  EFFECTIVE WITH THE FY-11 PROMOTION CYCLE, THE NEW PMP COMMUNITY 
WILL BE A SEPARATE COMPETITIVE CATEGORY FOR ALL PROMOTION BOARDS.

5.  THE POINT OF CONTACT IS CAPT ROBERT FINK, HUMAN RESOURCES COMMUNITY 
MANAGER, AT (901) 874-4049/DSN 882 OR E-MAIL AT
