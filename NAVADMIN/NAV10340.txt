SUBJ/CRIME REDUCTION PROGRAM INTRODUCES THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS 
CAMPAIGN//

RMKS/ 1. THE CRIME REDUCTION PROGRAM (CRP) IS A COMMUNITY OUTREACH 
INITIATIVE DESIGNED TO REDUCE CRIMINAL THREATS AFFECTING THE DEPARTMENT 
OF THE NAVY (DON). IT IS LED BY THE NAVAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE SERVICE 
(NCIS) AND INCLUDES BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY SERVICE PARTNERS 
WITHIN THE DON. EACH QUARTER, THE CRP IDENTIFIES A RELEVANT ISSUE TO 
HIGHLIGHT THROUGH A ROBUST BRIEFING PROGRAM AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH 
EVENTS. BEGINNING 01OCT10 THROUGH 31DEC10, THE CRP WILL FOCUS ITS 
EFFORTS ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WITHIN THE NAVY.

2. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DIRECTLY IMPACTS SAILORS, WHICH IN TURN, ERODES 
OPERATIONAL READINESS AND MORALE AND WELFARE. FOR THESE REASONS, IT IS 
TO THE NAVY'S BENEFIT TO PROMOTE STABLE FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS.
WORKING TO PREVENT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HELPS SUSTAIN HEALTHY FAMILIES AND 
ASSURE MISSION READINESS.

3. THE CRP WILL SEEK TO PROVIDE EDUCATION AND AWARENESS TO SAILORS AND 
THEIR FAMILIES REGARDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. EDUCATION IS PARAMOUNT TO 
HELPING SAILORS IDENTIFY STRESSORS AND HOW TO COPE WITH THEM BEFORE THEY  
ESCALATE TO CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. THE CRP WILL ADDRESS CONSEQUENCES OF 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ITS IMPACT ON THE VICTIM, OFFENDER, AND CHILDREN. 
SAILORS WILL ALSO BE MADE AWARE OF RESOURCES TO SEEK ASSISTANCE.

4. THROUGHOUT THIS THREE-MONTH CAMPAIGN, NCIS CRP REPRESENTATIVES WILL 
VISIT A VARIETY OF COMMANDS TO PROVIDE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS 
BRIEFINGS. BY CREATING ENHANCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS, NCIS, NAVY 
COMMANDS, AND ALL NAVAL PERSONNEL CAN WORK TOGETHER TO ELIMINATE ITS 
NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE NAVY.
