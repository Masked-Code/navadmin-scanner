2.  The Lateral Transfer/Redesignation Board is extremely competitive.  
Each record that is presented to the board is carefully reviewed and
the best and fully qualified are chosen.

3.  Quota constraints for junior year groups (07 through 11) were 
especially tight, thus the demand signal far exceeded the supply 
pool.  Many quality applicants were identified by the board but could
not be selected due to quota constraints of either the outgoing 
community or gaining community.  Unsuccessful applicants should apply
again (and again as required), while sustaining superior performance. 

4.  As always, competition for redesignation was keen and every 
community had a pool of highly qualified candidates.  Eligible 
officers not initially selected, and who did not specifically request
not to be reviewed by communities other than their first or second 
choice, were subsequently reviewed by all other communities.  Those 
officers tentatively selected for communities not initially requested 
will be notified via official correspondence and offered the 
opportunity to redesignate.

5.  The process, while never perfect, is fair and thorough.  Board 
members are focused on their task:  picking the right candidate who 
is best and fully qualified from the available applicants.  Each 
record receives a detailed scrub and there are thoughtful and 
deliberate discussions on each applicant.

6.  This message is not authority to deliver change of designator 
letters to the selectee.
    a.  Officers who are promotion selectees should contact their 
current detailer to discuss redesignation timing.  COMNAVPERSCOM 
(PERS-803), upon notification by COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) that the 
selectee has been made available to their new community, will forward
a redesignation letter to the selectee or appointment acceptance and
oath of office (NAVPERS 1000/4), as applicable.
    b.  Officers who are not promotion selectees and who are not 
under orders can expect assignment to a new billet appropriate to 
their new designation when notified by COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4).
    c.  If a member is currently under orders and transfers prior to
notification by COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4), member must execute orders 
under current designator and must complete 12 months at the new 
assignment, unless a shorter tour is prescribed (tours in excess of 
one year will be with the concurrence of the gaining community), 
prior to redesignation.

7.  The following are exceptions to the above:
    a.  Surface Warfare (11XX) Officers who are under orders to 
department head school may not lateral transfer until completion of
initial department head tour. 
    b.  Aviation Officers (131X and 132X) shall not be permitted to
lateral transfer until completion of active duty service obligation, 
expiration of aviation career continuation pay contract, or planned 
rotation date, whichever is later.
    c.  Applicants for 1510 who are presently designated 131X or 132X
and a second sea tour or aviation department head tour has not been 
completed, assignment to 1510 billets may be delayed until the 
completion of applicable second sea and/or aviation department head 
tour, as determined by COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-43).

8.  Commanding officers shall:
    a.  Ensure officers selected for promotion within their current 
community do not accept redesignation before their promotion date.
    b.  Notify COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-803) within 30 days of release of
this message of selectees who do not desire to accept transfer/
redesignation.

9.  The next Transfer/Redesignation Board will be held on 
12 November 2013.  Applications must be received by 6 September 2013.
Previous applications are not retained, non-selectees from previous
boards must submit a new application for consideration.  A future 
NAVADMIN will stipulate all of the eligibility requirements and 
application procedures per refs (a) through (d).
