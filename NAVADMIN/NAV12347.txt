RMKS/1.  THE INFORMATION IN THIS NAVADMIN IS EFFECTIVE UPON RECEIPT.  
THE PURPOSE IS TO CONSOLIDATE ACTIONS AND AMPLIFY INFORMATION 
PERTAINING TO INMARSAT AND THE TRANSITION TO THE DEFENSE INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS AGENCY (DISA) FUTURE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS 
ACQUISITION (FCSA) CONTRACT.

2.  AS DISCUSSED IN REF A, DISA IS IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) USERS OF INMARSAT TO THE FCSA CONTRACT.  
FOR NAVY, THIS INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 1,000 USERS THAT ARE INCLUDED 
IN BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS (BPA).  THE BUNDLING OF USERS INTO BPA
IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE A GREATER COST REDUCTION.  EVERY USER OF 
INMARSAT, BROADBAND GLOBAL AREA NETWORK (BGAN), OR LEGACY INMARSAT 
MUST MAINTAIN UP TO DATE RECORDS TO INCLUDE DISA MESSAGES AND 
FREQUENTLY VERIFY INFORMATION IN THE DISA DIRECT ORDER ENTRY (DDOE)
ONLINE TOOL.  

3.  PER REF B, THE FOLLOWING REFLECTS END OF LIFE DATES FOR LEGACY 
INMARSAT SERVICES. ALL NAVY USERS MUST PLAN AHEAD IN TRANSITIONING TO 
INMARSAT BROADBAND GLOBAL AREA NETWORK (BGAN) OR OTHER SATELLITE 
COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES BEFORE THESE DATES:
    A.  SATELLITE PHONE SERVICE: COMPLETED 30 SEP 11.
    B.  LARGE ANTENNA MINI M (LAMM): 28 DEC 12.
    C.  GLOBAL AREA NETWORK (GAN): 30 SEP 14.
    D.  INMARSAT B: 30 SEP 14.
    E.  INMARSAT M: 30 SEP 14.
    F.  AERO H: 30 SEP 16.
    G.  LIFETIME OF I-3 SATELLITES: 2016 (SUPPORTS AERO I AND ISAT 
M2M).
    H.  LIFETIME OF I-4 SATELLITES: 2023 (SUPPORTS GLOBAL SATELLITE 
PHONE SERVICE, BGAN, FLEETBROADBAND, SWIFTBROADBAND, AERO H PLUS, 
INMARSAT C, AND ISATDATA PRO)
    I.  SWIFT 64: NO EARLIER THAN DEC 18.
    J.  FLEET AND AERO MINI-M: NO EARLIER THAN DEC 16.
    K.  MINI-M MARITIME AND LAND: NO EARLIER THAN DEC 16.
    L.  INMARSAT D PLUS: NO EARLIER THAN 2014.

4. PER REF C, ALL COMMERCIAL SATCOM USERS MUST BE RECORDED IN THE 
SATELLITE DATA BASE (SDB).  ENTRY IN THE SDB IS MANDATORY IN ORDER TO
TRANSITION TO THE NEW DISA FCSA CONTRACT.  NAVY 01053 HAS BEEN 
APPROVED FOR USE BY ALL NAVY BGAN USERS. 

5.  INMARSAT BGAN DISCREET SUBSCRIBER IDENTITY MODULE (SIM) CARDS ARE
AN OPTION WHEN PURCHASING SERVICE FROM DISA.  THESE DISCREET SIM 
CARDS PROVIDE INCREASED OPERATIONAL SECURITY PROTECTION. THE ONE 
DRAWBACK IN PURCHASING A DISCRETE SIM CARD COMPARED TO A STANDARD SIM
CARD IS THAT CALL COMPLETION WILL BE DENIED BY THE SERVICING INMARSAT 
WHEN OPERATING IN THE CHINA AND RUSSIA GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. THE COST OF 
THE DISCRETE SIM CARD IS THE SAME AS A STANDARD SIM CARD. IF 
ALTERNATE COMMUNICATIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, USERS OF INMARSAT BGAN 
ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONSIDER THE ADDITION OF A STANDARD SIM CARD WHEN 
AN IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL CONNECTION IS NECESSARY. 

6.  PER REF D, POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE MAY OCCUR FOR INMARSAT USERS 
FROM NEW COMMERCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS OF SIMILAR SATELLITE 
COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITY.  DOD CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER (CIO) 
RECOMMENDS TRANSITIONING FROM LEGACY INMARSAT TO BGAN AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE TO MITIGATE EXPECTED INTERFERENCE PROBLEMS. 

7.  ALL UNITED STATES SHIPS (USS) THAT WERE SOLELY RELIANT ON 
INMARSAT HAVE TRANSITIONED TO THE NAVY COMMERCIAL BROADBAND SATELLITE
PROGRAM (CBSP).  PER REFS E AND F, AND UNLESS OTHERWISE DIRECTED, 
INMARSAT TERMINALS ON SHIPS ARE TO BE PLACED IN INACTIVE EQUIPMENT 
MAINTENANCE (IEM) STATUS. REFS G AND H PROVIDE INFORMATION ON PLACING
INMARSAT TERMINALS IN IEM. 

8. OUTSTANDING INMARSAT BILLS ARE MAINTAINED BY THE FEDERAL 
COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION VIA A MONTHLY LIST TO DOD CIO. USERS APPEAR
ON THE LIST WHEN THEY ACQUIRE SERVICE VIA A LAND EARTH STATION (LES)
THAT IS NOT AUTHORIZED BY DISA OR WHEN A TERMINAL IS TRANSFERRED 
BETWEEN USERS WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE DECOMMISSIONING AND 
RECOMMISSIONING PROCESS. THE MAJORITY OF THE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE 
RESOLVED WITH THE HELP OF ECHELON II COMMANDS. IF OUTSTANDING BILLS 
ARE NOT PAID, USERS RISK POTENTIAL BARRING OF THE TERMINAL FROM 
OPERATING ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. ECHELON II COMMANDS MUST CONTINUE TO
WORK WITH LOWER ECHELON COMMANDS TO RESOLVE PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING 
BILLS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

9. THE INFORMATION IN THIS NAVADMIN AND REF I WILL SOON BE 
INCORPORATED IN AN OPNAVINST ON COMSATCOM POLICY.  CONTACT THE OPNAV
POC TO REQUEST ASSISTANCE WITH COMMERCIAL SATELLITE ISSUES. SUBJECT 
MATTER EXPERTS IN THIS MESSAGE INCLUDE:  NAVCYBERFOR N82 FOR THE SDB, 
NAVCYBERFOR N43 FOR COMMISSIONING AND DECOMMISSIONING LEGACY INMARSAT 
TERMINALS, NAVAL CIRCUIT MANAGEMENT OFFICE FOR ASSISTANCE WITH THE 
DISA DIRECT ORDER ENTRY (DDOE) INTERNET TOOL, AND SPAWAR FLEET 
READINESS DIRECTORATE FOR SHIPBOARD INMARSAT TERMINALS.
