RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces Military Housing Privatization Initiative 
(MHPI) companies operating Public-Private Venture (PPV) military housing on 
or near Navy installations are permitted to require refundable pet deposits. 
 
2.  In alignment with standard industry practice and other military Services, 
our privatized housing partners now have the option of requiring refundable 
pet deposits from active duty military tenants who sign a new universal 
lease. 
This option aligns with current pet deposit requirements from other 
authorized tenants of PPV military family housing; such as, affiliated and 
unaffiliated civilians.  This NAVADMIN does not apply to active duty military 
tenants living in government-owned and controlled military family housing on 
Navy installations; most of which is located overseas. 
 
3.  The implementation of a refundable pet deposit is at the discretion of 
the individual PPV military family housing partner and may vary across 
locations. Pet deposits may not be retroactively applied to existing leases. 
 
4.  The maximum pet deposit is $250.00 per pet, up to $500.00 per household. 
Pet deposits are fully refundable, subject to pet-specific damages that may 
occur during the term of the tenants lease.  Military family housing partners 
will be expected to identify pet damage charges separately from standard 
move-out damage charges when providing detailed damage amounts to tenants. 
The refundable pet deposit cannot be applied toward non-pet damages.  In 
accordance with applicable laws, pet deposits will not be required for 
service or assistance animals. 
 
5.  For questions concerning refundable pet deposits, contact your local Navy 
Housing Service Center (HSC).  Contact information for all Navy HSCs is 
available on the Commander, Navy Installations Command website at 
https://ffr.cnic.navy.mil/Navy-Housing/Contact-Navy-Housing/.
