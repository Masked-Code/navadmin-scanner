lasting influence on platforms and systems that directly impact the future 
warfighting capability of the fleet.  Request command and fleet community 
assistance to identify candidates with strong operational performance and 
ideally, strong academic backgrounds in Science, Technology, Engineering and 
Mathematics fields of study.

2.  To be eligible for board consideration, a command endorsed application in 
line with reference (a), must be received by MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) no

until 6 Dec 2019, but must be submitted by the applicant, as a letter to the 
board, in line with subparagraph 3a below.  The command endorsement shall 
explicitly state whether the applicant, if selected, will be allowed and

dates after these respective dates may be removed from consideration and not 
reviewed by the board.

explicitly stated in the command endorsement that the endorsing command will 
provide TEMADD funds until the applicant can officially detach.  The e-mail
