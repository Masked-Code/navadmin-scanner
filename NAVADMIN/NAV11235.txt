OUTLINES ADDITIONAL NAVY TRANSFERABILITY POLICY FOR INDIVIDUAL SERVICE 
OBLIGATIONS AND FORCE SHAPING AS ANNOUNCED IN REF D.

2.  REF C ANNOUNCED CHANGES TO THE POST 9-11 GI BILL THAT IMPACT VETERANS, 
MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.
THE VARIOUS CHANGES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN INCREMENTS AS FOLLOWS:
    A.  EFFECTIVE 5 MARCH 2011, ACTIVE DUTY MEMBERS AND THEIR SPOUSES ARE 
LIMITED TO THE NET COST FOR TUITION AND FEES PRORATED ON THE PREVIOUSLY 
ESTABLISHED ELIGIBILITY TIERS (40-100 PERCENT) FOR VETERANS AND MEMBERS OF THE 
SELECTED RESERVE.  ELIGIBILITY TIERS AND PERIODS OF QUALIFYING ACTIVE DUTY 
TIME ARE PROVIDED IN REF B.  CHANGE IN PAYMENTS BEGAN WITH EDUCATIONAL TERMS 
STARTING ON OR AFTER 5 MARCH 2011.
    B.  EFFECTIVE 1 AUGUST 2011:
        (1) ALL IN-STATE TUITION AND FEES FOR INDIVIDUALS PURSUING DEGREES 
FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS, LESS ANY OTHER EDUCATION ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE TO THE 
STUDENT, WILL BE PAID THROUGH POST 9-11 GI BILL.
FOR THOSE WITH 100 PERCENT ELIGIBILITY, THE YELLOW RIBBON PROGRAM REMAINS 
AVAILABLE (EXCLUDING ACTIVE DUTY MEMBERS AND THEIR SPOUSES) TO PAY FOR OUT-OF 
STATE TUITION AND FEES.
    (2) TUITION AND FEES FOR INDIVIDUALS PURSUING DEGREES FROM PRIVATE AND 
FOREIGN SCHOOLS WHO ENROLLED ON OR AFTER 4 JAN 2011, WILL BE CAPPED A $17,500 
PER ACADEMIC YEAR.  IN AUGUST 2011, CONGRESS PASSED A TEMPORARY PROVISION 
PRESERVING THE HIGHER TUITION AND FEE RATE ESTABLISHED BY REF A FOR STUDENTS 
ATTENDING PROGRAMS OF  EDUCATION AT NON-PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING 
AND WHO WERE ENROLLED BEFORE 4 JAN 2011.  THIS PROVISION BEGINS 1 AUGUST 2011 
AND EXPIRES
31 JULY 2014.  THIS PROVISION DOES NOT IMPACT STUDENTS ENROLLED IN FOREIGN 
SCHOOLS.  FOR THOSE WITH 100 PERCENT ELIGIBILITY, THE YELLOW RIBBON PROGRAM 
REMAINS AVAILABLE (EXCLUDING ACTIVE DUTY MEMBERS AND THEIR SPOUSES) TO PAY FOR 
TUITION AND FEES ABOVE THE CAP.

EXAMINATION WILL BE ALLOWED.  ONE MONTH OF ENTITLEMENT  WILL BE CHARGED, 
ROUNDED TO THE NEAREST WHOLE MONTH, FOR EACH $1,460  IN REIMBURSEMENTS.
ENTITLEMENT WILL NOT BE ROUNDED DOWN TO ZERO MONTHS.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF  A 
MEMBER USES POST 9-11 GI BILL TO FUND A CERTIFICATION EXAM WHICH  COSTS $47, 
THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS (DVA) WILL ROUND THAT  UP AND CHARGE ONE 
MONTH OF EDUCATION BENEFITS.
        (5) REIMBURSEMENT OF FEES PAID TO TAKE NATIONAL EXAMS USED  FOR 
ADMISSION TO AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING SUCH AS THE ACT,  GMAT, OR SAT 
WILL BE ALLOWED.  BENEFIT WILL BE CHARGED THE SAME AS  FOR CERTIFICATION OR 
LICENSING EXAMS ADDRESSED IN PARA 2.B4.
        (6) THE MONTHLY LIVING STIPEND WILL BE PRORATED BASED ON RATE OF 
PURSUIT AND ROUNDS UP TO THE NEAREST MULTIPLE OF 10.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE RATE 
OF PURSUIT IS 75 PERCENT, DVA WILL ROUND PAYMENT TO 80 PERCENT.  ELIGIBLE 
STUDENTS MUST ATTEND FULL-TIME TO DRAW 100  PERCENT.
        (7) CONCURRENT USE OF TRANSFERRED BENEFITS FROM MORE THAN ONE 
INDIVIDUAL WILL BE PROHIBITED.
        (8) CONCURRENT RECEIPT OF ASSISTANCE UNDER THE NATIONAL CALL  TO 
SERVICE PROGRAM AND POST 9-11 WILL BE PROHIBITED.
        (9) POST 9-11 WILL BE THE NET BILL PAYER.  FOR EXAMPLE,  TUITION 
ASSISTANCE (TOP-UP), TUITION RELATED SCHOLARSHIPS,  EDUCATIONAL LOANS,GRANTS, 
OR EMPLOYER FUNDED TUITION WILL BE THE  FIRST TUITION PAYER.

SUPPLIES.
            (B) ACTIVE DUTY MEMBERS WHO ARE USING TOP-UP MAY USE UP  TO $1,000

        (2) HOUSING ALLOWANCE WILL BE PAYABLE TO STUDENTS (OTHER THAN ACTIVE 
DUTY AND THEIR SPOUSES) ENROLLED IN A DISTANCE LEARNING  PROGRAM LEADING TO A 
DEGREE FROM AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING.
 THE HOUSING ALLOWANCE IS EQUAL TO 50 PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE  BASIC 
ALLOWANCE FOR HOUSING (BAH) FOR AN E5 WITH DEPENDENTS.  THE  HOUSING ALLOWANCE 
IS PRORATED BASED ON THE RATE OF PURSUIT.  MEMBERS  SHOULD CONTACT THE DVA FOR
