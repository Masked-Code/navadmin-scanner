RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a) and provides guidance for the 
Fiscal Year 2021 Cybersecurity Awareness Challenge (CAC) training 
requirement.

2.  Per references (b) and (c), Navy military, civilian, and contractor 
personnel with access to unclassified or classified networks must complete 
the Department of Defense (DoD) employee version of CAC by 30 September 2021.

3.  Personnel who completed CAC 2020 after 30 September 2020 but before CAC 
2021 was available shall receive credit for their annual FY21 training.

4.  Authorized methods for training delivery:
    a.  Commands can elect to complete CAC training using instructor-led 
delivery.  A command designated cybersecurity professional such as the 
Information Systems Security Manager (ISSM) or Cybersecurity Workforce (CSWF) 
Program Manager must provide the training.
    b.  Total Workforce Management Service (TWMS), https://twms.navy.mil/ 
selfservice/login.asp;
    c.  Navy e-Learning (NEL), https://learning.nel.navy.mil; (Note:  The My 
Navy Portal, https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/general-skills-training/gmt
(redirects users to the NEL link));
    d.  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) website, https://cyber.mil/ 
training/cyber-awareness-challenge/
    e.  Other approved training sources, DISA Digital Video Discs (DVDs).

5.  Ships can access the annual training from the NEL application hosted on 
the Navy Information/Application Product Suite (NIAPS) server, eliminating 
the need to reach back to shore hosted NEL websites.  The CAC 2021 course is 
available via the NEL Afloat Learning Management System Pub Amendment 112 for 
download by the NIAPS Administrator using the normal manual NIAPS distance 
support update process.  If unable to download Learning Management System Pub 
Amendment 112, ships can request a DVD with these files to be mailed by 
submitting a support request to Navy 311.

6.  Although CAC training is an individual responsibility, commanders and 
commanding officers are accountable for 100 percent completion of their 
personnel.  Effective as of September 1, 2020, the DoD Cyber Hygiene 
Scorecard collects information on the number of users who completed annual 
Cybersecurity Awareness training and the scorecard is briefed quarterly to 
the Deputy Secretary of Defense.  Training officers are responsible for 
ensuring their personnel complete and properly document the required 
training.

7.  Command training officers must validate training completed via TWMS or 
Fleet Training Management and Planning System (FLTMPS) 
(https://ntmpsweb.ncdc.navy.mil/fltmps/) authoritative databases.  For 
training completed via the DISA website, DISA DVDs, or instructor-led, 
training officers will manually record completed training in FLTMPS using the 
Learning Event Completion Form.
Report any discrepancies to the Navy Training Management Planning System 
Operational Support office at ntmps.support(at)navy.mil or
(866) 438-2898/DSN 922-1867.

8.  The ISSM is responsible for reporting compliance to meet Federal 
Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 requirements.  Command ISSMs 
will disable accounts of users who do not complete training by 30 September 
2021 and provide non-compliance list to the Echelon II training officer for 
consolidation and final reporting to Naval Information Forces (NAVIFOR) CIO1 
at Navy CSWF Program Helpline at Navy_CWF_Program.fct(at)navy.mil.  POC for 
NAVIFOR CIO1 is Josh Wright, joshua.wright7(at)navy.mil.

9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded.

10.  Released by VADM Jeffrey E. Trussler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations 
for Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
