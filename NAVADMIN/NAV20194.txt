NARR/REF A IS ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE NAVY (MANPOWER AND RESERVE
AFFAIRS) MEMO, COVID-19 REQUIREMENT FOR FACE COVERINGS ON DOD INSTALLATIONS.  
REF B IS NAVADMIN 100/20, NAVY GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF FACE COVERINGS.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN reiterates the face covering policies promulgated in 
references (a) and (b) and provides service specific wear guidance for 
Sailors in uniform.  While the Navy is considering whether face coverings 
should be a formal uniform item governed by uniform regulations, at present, 
they are considered personal protective equipment (PPE) and while in uniform, 
face coverings will comply with the guidance provided in this NAVADMIN.

2.  Background.  Reference (a) requires personnel on Department of Defense 
(DoD) property, installations and facilities to wear cloth face coverings 
when social distancing of 6 feet cannot be maintained.  As one of several 
COVID-19 protective measures, initial face covering guidance facilitated 
immediate wear of face coverings that were conservative in appearance, not 
offensive and conformed to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) guidance outlined in reference (b).  Maximum flexibility permitted the 
procurement or production of face coverings through multiple sources, 
designs, colors and durability to ensure Commanders could rapidly field face 
coverings to their personnel.  Procurement, design and wear guidance was less 
defined pending the availability of more durable and conservative designed 
government procured face coverings.

3.  Face Coverings in Uniform.  Face coverings are issued to all new 
accessions at the beginning of accession training and to ensure their ability 
to facilitate required COVID-19 mitigation efforts while enroute to their 
next duty station.  Commands are authorized to procure and issue face 
coverings to assigned personnel and when worn with Navy uniforms all face 
coverings will conform to the guidance promulgated by the CDC in line with 
reference (a).  The following additional guidelines also apply.  Face 
coverings will:
    a.  Fit snugly and comfortably on the face for prolonged wear.
    b.  Cover the chin and extend over the bridge of the nose.
    c.  Not impede the wearing of eyeglasses nor result in fogging of the 
glass lens.
    d.  Be conservative in appearance, non-offensive and will not bring 
discredit upon the wearer or the Navy.
    e.  Be of a plain neutral color (black, brown, tan, white, grey, green, 
blue) or matching camouflage pattern when wearing camouflage uniforms only.  
No lettering/wording, logos, symbols, prints or patterns other than matching 
camouflage uniform pattern are authorized.
    f.  Contain fastening devices that are neutral in color and made of 
elastic, cord or string and loop or tie around the back of the ears or back 
of the head (barrel lock devices are also authorized when not affected by 
safety or foreign object debris restrictions).
    g.  Constructed of at least two layers of cloth fabric material (single-
layer face covering provided by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and Navy 
Exchange (NEXCOM) are acceptable).  Use caution to ensure multi-layer fabric 
face coverings facilitate ease of breathing without restriction during dry, 
humid and rainy conditions.

4.  Procurement.  Individually made or individual purchase of commercial face 
coverings is authorized provided they meet CDC and the above stated 
guidelines.  Commands/units may procure face coverings via DLA or open 
purchase if DLA procured face coverings do not meet mission requirements.  
Face covering purchases may also be facilitated via the NEXCOM for individual 
and bulk orders.  Order DLA face coverings through FedMall or via standard 
requisitioning procedures.  The following National Stock Numbers (NSN) have 
been assigned:
