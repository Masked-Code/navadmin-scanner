RMKS/1.  NAVY'S PHYSICAL FITNESS ASSESSMENT (PFA) IS DESIGNED TO ASSESS, 
TWICE PER YEAR, EVERY SAILOR'S ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE THE MINIMUM LEVEL 
OF FITNESS REQUIRED FOR NAVAL SERVICE.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS NAVADMIN IS 
TO HIGHLIGHT POLICY UPDATES AND PROVIDE CLARIFICATION.
2.  FOR ACTIVE DUTY SAILORS WITH TWO PFA FAILURES IN THE MOST RECENT 
THREE-YEAR PERIOD, THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED BILLET RESTRICTIONS REMAIN 
IN EFFECT.  DRILLING RESERVISTS WITH TWO PFA FAILURES IN THE MOST 
RECENT THREE-YEAR PERIOD ARE PROHIBITED FROM INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE 
MANPOWER MANAGEMENT (IAMM) MOBILIZATIONS.  SAILORS WITH THREE PFA 
FAILURES IN THE MOST RECENT FOUR-YEAR PERIOD ARE INELIGIBLE 
FOR PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION TRANSFER, REENLISTMENT OR EXTENSION.   
TRANSFERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE AUTHORIZED FOR DRILLING RESERVISTS WHO, 
DUE TO A CHANGE IN RESIDENCE OR UNIT DISESTABLISHMENT, ARE NO LONGER 
WITHIN A REASONABLE COMMUTING DISTANCE FROM A RESERVE UNIT, AS DEFINED 
BY DODI 1215.13.
    A.  REQUESTS FOR EXCEPTION TO THE RESTRICTION ON BILLET ASSIGNMENTS 
OR TRANSFERS FOR ACTIVE DUTY PERSONNEL SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO 
NAVPERSCOM (PERS-4, INFO PERS-8) OR OPNAV N133 FOR NUCLEAR RATED 
SAILORS AND NUCLEAR TRAINED OFFICERS.  AN EXAMPLE OF A TRANSFER WAIVER 
REQUEST IS LOCATED AT 
HTTP://WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/COMMANDSUPPORT/PHYSICALREADINESS/LINKS.HTM.  
PER REF C, COMMANDING OFFICERS SHALL NOT AUTHORIZE CONDITIONAL SHORT 
TERM EXTENSIONS FOR SAILORS WHO ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE 
PFA AND HAVE FAILED THREE TIMES WITHIN A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD WITHOUT A 
WAIVER FROM NAVPERSCOM (PERS-811 FOR ACTIVE, PERS-812 FOR FULL TIME 
SUPPORT AND CANVAS RECRUITER, PERS-913 FOR DRILLING RESERVISTS, AND
N133 FOR NUCLEAR RATED SAILORS AND NUCLEAR TRAINED OFFICERS). 
    B.  PER REF B, PROGRESS WAIVERS ARE NO LONGER AUTHORIZED.  
PROGRESS WAIVERS GRANTED DURING THE 2009 CYCLE 1 PFA (PRIOR TO 30 JUNE 
2009) EXPIRE UPON COMPLETION OF THE NEXT PFA OR 31 DECEMBER 2009, 
WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST.  SAILORS WHO WERE GRANTED A PROGRESS WAIVER AND 
STILL HAVE THREE OR MORE PFA FAILURES IN THE MOST RECENT FOUR YEAR 
PERIOD AFTER WAIVER EXPIRATION SHALL BE PROCESSED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE 
SEPARATION UNLESS A READINESS WAIVER IS REQUESTED BY THE COMMANDING 
OFFICER FROM HIS/HER IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR IN CHARGE.
    C.  COMMANDS/UNITS THAT CANNOT COMPLETE THE PHYSICAL READINESS TEST 
DUE TO DEPLOYMENT/OPERATIONAL COMMITMENTS MUST SELECT THE DEP/OP STATUS 
IN THE PHYSICAL READINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (PRIMS).  
COMMANDING OFFICERS SHOULD ENSURE A BODY COMPOSITION ANALYSIS (BCA) IS 
COMPLETED FOR ALL PERSONNEL, EVEN IF NON-PARTICIPATION IN THE PHYSICAL 
READINESS TEST IS JUSTIFIED AND DOCUMENTED IN PRIMS.  SAILORS WHO DO 
NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PRT AND EXCEED BCA STANDARDS WILL BE RECORDED AS 
A PFA FAILURE AND WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE DOD BCA EXCEPTION.  
INDIVIDUALS FAILING A SCALE WEIGHT TEST SHALL BE TAPED THREE TIMES, 
WITH AN AVERAGE COMPUTED TO DETERMINE ACTUAL BODY COMPOSITION.  IF 
THERE IS MORE THAN AN INCH DIFFERENCE IN THE THREE MEASUREMENTS, A 
FOURTH MEASUREMENT WILL BE TAKEN BY A DIFFERENT MEASURER. 
    D.  IN ALL CASES (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF APPROVED BCA MEDICAL 
WAIVERS), SAILORS MUST MEET BODY FAT STANDARDS TO PASS THE SEMI-ANNUAL 
REQUIREMENTS.  THIS INCLUDES THOSE SAILORS WITH LESS THAN 10 WEEKS ON 
BOARD DURING THE OFFICIAL PFA CYCLE.  
    E.  OPNAV N133 MAINTAINS FINAL APPROVAL AUTHORITY FOR ALL PFA 
WAIVER AND ADMINISTRATIVE SEPARATIONS FOR NUCLEAR RATED SAILORS AND 
NUCLEAR TRAINED OFFICERS.
