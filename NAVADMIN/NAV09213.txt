RMKS/1. CAMPAIGN DRUG FREE (CDF) IS ONE OF SIX NAVY FLAGSHIP PROGRAMS 
AND IS OPEN TO ALL NAVY, MARINE CORPS, AND COAST GUARD VOLUNTEERS. PER 
REF A, COMMANDER, NAVY RESERVE FORCE IS THE EXECUTIVE AGENT FOR CDF AND 
EACH YEAR, THE NAVY RECOGNIZES COMMANDS THAT HAVE COORDINATED THE MOST 
EFFECTIVE AND EXEMPLARY COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROJECTS.
2. IT IS WITH GREAT PLEASURE THAT I ANNOUNCE THE 2008 CAMPAIGN DRUG 
FREE FLAGSHIP AWARD WINNING COMMANDS:
A. SMALL SHORE WINNER: NAVY OPERATIONAL SUPPORT CENTER, ERIE, PA. 2,443 
STUDENTS AGES 5-12, WERE EDUCATED REGARDING THE BENEFITS OF A DRUG FREE 
LIFESTYLE INCLUDING AN EMPHASIS ON OBTAINING PLEDGES FROM STUDENTS ON 
REMAINING DRUG FREE.
B. MEDIUM SHORE WINNER:
NAVY INFORMATION OPERATIONS COMMAND, SUGAR GROVE, WV. VOLUNTEERS FROM 
THE COMMAND ORGANIZED A DRUG ABUSE RESISTANCE EDUCATION (DARE) PROGRAM 
IN THE EASTERN WEST VIRGINIA SCHOOL SYSTEM WHERE STUDENTS WERE NOT ONLY 
EDUCATED ABOUT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL USE, BUT 
PROVIDED STUDENTS WITH STRATEGIES FOR RESISTING PEER PRESSURE, BUILDING 
SELF ESTEEM, AND HOW TO IMPROVE THEIR DECISION MAKING SKILLS.
C. LARGE SHORE WINNER:
NAVAL SUBMARINE BASE, KINGS BAY, GA. HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS IN 11 ADOPTED 
SCHOOLS WERE EDUCATED IN THE CDF MESSAGE BY COMMAND VOLUNTEERS. THEY 
REACHED MORE THAN 2,000 YOUNG PEOPLE DURING A STREET SMART CAMPAIGN 
THAT WAS DESIGNED TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE TRAUMA RELATED DEATH AND 
INJURY OF YOUNG ADULTS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HIGH RISK BEHAVIOR.
3. THROUGHOUT THE NAVY, COMMAND, AND INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATION IN CDF 
BENEFITED THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY SERVE AND DEMONSTRATED THE 
SENSE OF COMMUNITY RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR SAILORS, MARINES, COAST 
GUARDSMEN, AND CIVLILANS. I OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS AND APPRECIATION 
TO EACH OF YOU WHO SERVE.
4. AWARD WINNERS WILL RECEIVE COMMEMORATIVE PLAQUES IN RECOGNITION OF 
THEIR EXCEPTIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS.
