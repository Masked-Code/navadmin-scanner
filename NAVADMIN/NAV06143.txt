(FLPB) PROGRAM POLICY.  REF B IS THE DEFENSE LANGUAGE TRANSFORMATION
ROADMAP.  REF C IS THE FY-06 NAVY STRATEGIC LANGUAGE LIST (SLL).//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES PROMULGATION OF NAVY S
FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY BONUS (FLPB) POLICY CONTAINED IN REF A
AND SUMMARIZES MAJOR REVISIONS TO THE PROGRAM.
2.  CONSISTENT WITH DEFENSE LANGUAGE TRANSFORMATION, REF B, THE
PROGRAM (FORMERLY KNOWN AS FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY PAY OR FLPP)
HAS UNDERGONE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO INCLUDE HIGHER AWARD LEVELS AND
EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY WITHIN BOTH THE ACTIVE AND RESERVE COMPONENTS.
THE PURPOSE OF THE FLPB PROGRAM IS TO INCENTIVIZE AND PROMOTE:
    A.  IDENTIFICATION OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE SKILLS
    B.  SUSTAINMENT AND IMPROVEMENT IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY
    C.  STUDY OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES, PARTICULARLY STRATEGIC
LANGUAGES.  THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS INCREASED FORCE
CAPABILITY AND CAPACITY IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES CONSIDERED CRITICAL TO
THE NAVY MISSION.
3.  MAJOR ELEMENTS OF THE NEW POLICY INCLUDE:
    A.  HIGHER AWARD LEVELS - NOT TO EXCEED $500 PER MONTH FOR
QUALIFYING PROFICIENCY IN A SINGLE FOREIGN LANGUAGE, OR $1,000 PER
MONTH FOR ANY COMBINATION OF MORE THAN ONE LANGUAGE.  THESE HIGHER
AWARD LEVELS ARE PROJECTED TO BECOME EFFECTIVE ON OR ABOUT 1 JUN
06 AND WILL APPLY FROM THAT DATE FORWARD.
    B.  AWARD LEVEL COMPUTATION - BASED ON THREE FACTORS:
        (1) LEVEL OF PROFICIENCY AS MEASURED BY THE DEFENSE LANGUAGE
PROFICIENCY TEST (DLPT) SYSTEM.
        (2) SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OR LANGUAGES IN WHICH PROFICIENCY IS
ACHIEVED.  NOT ALL FOREIGN LANGUAGES QUALIFY FOR FLPB.  TO SHAPE THE
NAVY S LINGUISTIC CAPABILITY, MISSION CRITICAL LANGUAGES ARE
INCENTIVIZED AT HIGHER RATES.  BASED ON EXISTING AND PROJECTED
MISSION NEEDS, FOREIGN LANGUAGES HAVE BEEN PRIORITIZED INTO
STRATEGIC (FURTHER CATEGORIZED INTO IMMEDIATE INVESTMENT AND
STRONGHOLD) AND OTHER LANGUAGES.  FLPB RATES ARE GRADUATED
ACCORDINGLY WITH IMMEDIATE INVESTMENT AUTHORIZED THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS
(FLPB A), FOLLOWED BY STRONGHOLD (FLPB B), AND OTHER (FLPB C).
QUALIFYING LANGUAGES ARE CONTAINED IN THE COMBINED DOD/NAVY
STRATEGIC LANGUAGE LIST (SLL) WHICH WAS DISTRIBUTED BY REF C THROUGH
OFFICIAL CHANNELS.  THE SLL WILL BE REVIEWED AND REISSUED ANNUALLY
TO ENSURE ITS PRIORITIES REFLECT THE LONG-TERM STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
AND MISSION NEEDS OF THE NAVY.
        (3) DOMINANT IN THE FORCE LANGUAGES.  WHERE SUFFICIENT
CAPACITY EXISTS IN THE FORCE, SOME FOREIGN LANGUAGES WILL BE
DESIGNATED AS BEING DOMINANT IN THE FORCE.  PAYMENT OF FLPB IN THOSE
LANGUAGES WILL BE LIMITED TO CAREER LINGUISTS AS DEFINED BY REF A,
AND THOSE SAILORS WHOSE DUTIES REQUIRE PROFICIENCY IN THE LANGUAGE.
    C.  ELIGIBILITY.  BASIC CRITERION FOR ALL FLPB RECIPIENTS IS A
QUALIFYING TEST SCORE VIA THE DLPT SYSTEM.  MINIMUM QUALIFYING
SCORES ARE LISTENING 2/READING 2 ON THE DLPT, OR AN OVERALL SCORE OF
LEVEL 2 ON THE ORAL PROFICIENCY INTERVIEW (OPI).  FOR SOME FOREIGN
LANGUAGES, SAILORS NEED NOT BE CAREER LINGUISTS OR OCCUPY
LANGUAGE-CODED BILLETS TO BE ELIGIBLE, PROVIDED THEY ATTAIN A
QUALIFYING TEST SCORE.
