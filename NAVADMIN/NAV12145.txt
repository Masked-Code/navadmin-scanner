SUBJ/HOUSING EARLY APPLICATION TOOL//

RMKS/1. HOUSING EARLY APPLICATION TOOL (HEAT) PROVIDES THE  OPPORTUNITY FOR 
ALL ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL OR THEIR SPOUSES  TO APPLY FOR HOUSING AT 
ONE OR MULTIPLE LOCATIONS BEFORE OR AFTER  RECEIVING PERMANENT CHANGE OF 
STATION (PCS) ORDERS. WHILE THIS TOOL  WILL ALLOW SAILORS TO RECEIVE HOUSING 
INFORMATION MUCH EARLIER IN  THE PCS PROCESS, IT WILL NOT AFFECT THEIR 
PLACEMENT ON THE  WAITLIST.

2. NAVY FAMILY HOUSING CUSTOMERS, SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES, HAVE  INDICATED 
THROUGH SURVEYS AND FOCUS GROUPS THAT:  1) THEY WOULD LIKE  A SIMPLER, EASIER 
HOUSING APPLICATION PROCESS, 2) THEY WANT TO  EMPLOY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY IN 
THE PROCESS VICE COPYING AND FAXING  INFORMATION AND 3) THEY WANT THE ABILITY 
TO APPLY EARLIER (PRIOR TO  ACTUAL RECEIPT OF ORDERS) IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE 
TIME TO EXPLORE AND  LEARN ABOUT HOUSING OPTIONS AT THEIR NEXT DUTY STATION. 
HEAT IS  DESIGNED TO ADDRESS EACH OF THESE AREAS.

3. HOUSING CUSTOMERS WILL BE ABLE TO SUBMIT APPLICATIONS ONLINE, AT  ANY TIME, 
TO MULTIPLE INSTALLATIONS, IN ORDER TO RECEIVE INFORMATION  ABOUT AVAILABLE 
HOUSING AND TO BEGIN THE QUALIFICATION PROCESS FOR  NAVY OR PPV HOUSING.

4. THE NAMES AND CONTACT INFORMATION FOR HEAT CUSTOMERS INDICATING AN  
INTEREST IN PPV HOUSING WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE PPV PARTNERS  IMMEDIATELY UPON 
PRE-QUALIFICATION.

5. THE HEAT APPLICATION WILL AUTOMATICALLY CHECK THE DEFENSE  ELIGIBILITY 
ENROLLMENT REPORTING SYSTEM (DEERS) AND THE ENTERPRISE  MILITARY HOUSING (EMH) 
SYSTEM TO POPULATE SOME OF THE HOUSING  APPLICATION DATA AND AID IN PRE-
QUALIFYING PERSONNEL.
