AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 3590.11G, THE ARLEIGH BURKE FLEET TROPHY/
MARJORIE STERRETT BATTLESHIP FUND AWARD/USS ARIZONA MEMORIAL TROPHY//

RMKS/1.  The Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy is awarded annually to one ship or 
aircraft squadron from each coast for achieving the greatest improvement in 
battle efficiency based on the Battle Efficiency Competition.

2.  It is an honor to announce the calendar year 2015 Arleigh Burke Fleet 
Trophy Award recipients for their superior performance and improvement in 
battle efficiency:
    a.  Atlantic Fleet:  USS MONTPELIER (SSN 765)
    b.  Pacific Fleet:  USS TEXAS (SSN 775)

3.  Selection for this award is a reflection of the quality and tenacity of 
these commands.
    a.  USS MONTPELIER (SSN 765) dramatically improved in overall operational 
performance and most notably in battle efficiency in 2015, with positive 
achievements in all mission areas including submarine operations and 
maintenance.  Further, the USS MONTPELIER (765) made significant improvements 
in operational excellence in each warfighting core competency, including 
strike operations, surface and undersea warfare, communications, and 
intelligence collection. USS MONTPELIER (SSN 765) successfully completed a 
demanding six month deployment to the U.S. Central Command theater of 
operations where she flawlessly executed missions vital to national security.  
Due to MONTPELIER's ship-wide dedication to improvement, she was ultimately 
evaluated as a top performer by the theater commander, receiving the highest 
accolades for operational performance, combat readiness and theater security 
cooperation.
    b.  USS TEXAS' (SSN 775) improvement in operational and warfighting 
readiness over the past year was truly impressive. The crew's tenacious focus 
on self-assessment and improvement in engineering readiness, personnel and 
supply management, and tactical capability culminated in the ship's 
phenomenal performance during preparations for a six month Western Pacific 
deployment in support of Seventh Fleet, and selection among nine submarines 
for the Submarine Squadron 1 Battle 'E'.

4.  Congratulations to USS MONTPELIER (USS 765) and USS TEXAS (SSN 775) for 
their continued dedication to duty and commitment to excellence.
