RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN updates policy in references (a) through (d) and is 
intended to provide tools and guidance for the safe execution of a Physical 
Fitness Assessment (PFA) as we emerge from the restricted Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (COVID-19) environment.  This NAVADMIN specifically: 
    a.  Provides a plan to conduct the Calendar Year 2021 (CY2021) PFA  
(1 July to 31 December 2021) to include the transition to a new and improved 
Physical Readiness Information Management System 2 (PRIMS-2). 
    b.  Provides additional guidance on conducting the PFA in the COVID-19 
environment, including the use of masks. 
    c.  Provides answers to frequently asked questions. 
    d.  Expands postpartum PFA exemption from 9 months to 12 months. 
 
2.  PFA Implementation Plan 
    a.  To assist commands in executing this PFA cycle, we created Physical 
Readiness Program (PRP) Guide 10, which explains how to conduct the CY2021 
PFA.  Updated guides are available on the MyNavy HR PRP website, at 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/21st-Century-Sailor/Physical-
Readiness/. 
    b.  PRIMS-2 will be online in September 2021.  PRIMS-2 has been designed 
to provide greater ease of use for Command Fitness Leaders (CFL) and better 
connectivity with associated human resources systems.  CFLs/Assistant Command 
Fitness Leaders (ACFLs) will enter all PFA documentation/results, with the 
exception of PARFQ data, into PRIMS-2 when available for use. 
    c.  As a reminder, Sailors are required to complete a Periodic Health 
Assessment (PHA) and if required, a Deployment Health Assessment (DHA) prior 
to commencing a Physical Readiness Test (PRT) or physical conditioning.  As 
COVID-19 has impacted PHA and DHA completion, commands are strongly 
encouraged to consider their annual PHA and DHA completion rates when 
scheduling the command PFA.  Commands may schedule multiple PFA periods 
during the cycle to accommodate PHA and DHA completion by Sailors. 
 
3.  Additional Guidance to Conduct the CY2021 PFA 
    a.  Preparation.  Since the official announcement on the new PRT 
modalities (forearm plank and 2000-meter row) in references (a) and (b), 
Sailors have been strongly encouraged to practice and prepare for the CY2021 
PFA, but commands should use this entire PFA window to ensure adequate 
notification and allow for preparatory training and readiness assessment 
prior to execution of the PRT. 
    b.  Scoring of Plank Modality.  Since the plank is a new mandatory 
modality, the score for the plank will not be included in their final score. 
Medically cleared Sailors will participate in the plank modality and should 
give it their best efforts as we will use scores to validate our scoring 
tables. 
    c.  Mask Use During PFA.  CFLs/ACFLs shall conduct official BCAs and PRTs 
as outlined in PRP Guides 4, 5, 10 and 15.  In line with Guide 15, fully 
vaccinated Department of Defense (DoD) personnel (who are at least two weeks 
beyond their final dose) are no longer required to wear a mask indoors or 
outdoors at DoD facilities.  All DoD personnel should continue to comply with 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance regarding areas 
where masks should be worn.  Personnel who are not fully vaccinated should 
continue to follow applicable DoD mask guidance when conducting BCA and use 
social distancing when performing PRT events.  PRP Guide 15 will be updated 
as COVID-19 guidance changes and contains mask guidance.  Sailors may unmask 
when actually performing PRT modalities.  Note:  If local requirements for 
masks are more or less restrictive, local requirements take precedence. 
    d.  Records and Data Management 
        (1) CFLs are required to retain original written documentation 
(notes, worksheets, Body Composition Assessment (BCA) and PRT Score sheets, 
etc.) of official command PFAs and Fitness Enhancement Program for a period 
of five years and in line with current personal identifiable information 
(PII) policy. 
        (2) All official PFA forms can be downloaded on the PRP Website 
forms section:  https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/21st-Century-
Sailor/Physical-Readiness/Forms/  
to include the revised PARFQ (NAVPERS 
6110/3) and PRT Score Sheet (NAVPERS 6110/11). 
          (3) CFLs should refer to PRP Guide 10 for roster maintenance upon 
PRIMS-2 release. 
 
4.  Reponses to Fleet Feedback.  The following items are provided for 
clarification to frequently asked questions: 
    a.  Excellent or Above Performance Validation.  All Sailors must 
participate in the CY2021 PFA cycle.  Sailors who pass the BCA within the 
Navy age-adjusted standards and score an overall excellent low or better 
(with no single event lower than good low) on the PRT modalities consisting 
of the push-ups and cardio options only are eligible to be exempt from 
participation in PRT Cycle 1-2022.  Forearm plank scores will not to be used 
in the calculation.  In order to validate, Sailors must also be within BCA 
age-adjusted standards in PFA Cycle 1-2022. 
    b.  Consecutive PFA Failures.  Due to CY2020 PFA Cycle being excused, PFA 
failures prior to 2021 will not be used in determining future consecutive 
failures.  For clarification: 
        (1) If a Sailor failed PRT Cycle 2-2019 and the official CY2021 PFA 
Cycle, it will not count as two consecutive PFA failures. 
        (2) However, going forward, if a Sailor fails the official CY2021 PFA 
Cycle and PFA Cycle 1-2022, this will be two consecutive failures and member 
will be subject to adverse administrative action. 
    c.  Fitness Report/Evaluation Guidance.  In line with reference (f), 
enter the one-letter code for the result of each official PFA conducted in 
the reporting period in block 20.  Due to CY2020 PFA Cycle being excused, the 
one-letter code *N* is to be used if the reporting period includes a PFA 
Cycle in 2020.  Format for block 20 must be from oldest to most recent PFA 
performed during the reporting period.  For example, *NNP* in block 20 and 
*PFA: 20-1/20-2/CY2020* in block 29 indicates that the member was excused for 
CY2020 PFA Cycle and passed the CY2021 PFA Cycle. 
    d.  Preparing for the upcoming PFA.  CFLs/ACFLs should be conducting 
command group physical training and BCA spot checks while following social 
distancing guidelines and preparing Sailors for the upcoming PFA proactively. 
Another useful tool is the Official Navy PFA App, which is available for 
download from the App Store. 
 
5.  Postpartum Policy Change.  Effective 1 July 2021, pregnant and postpartum 
Sailors are exempt from participating in the PFA, to include BCA and PRT, 
from the time a pregnancy is confirmed by a Health Care Provider (HCP) until 
the end of 12 months (vice previous 9 months guidance) following a qualified 
birth event (QBE) in line with PRP Guide 8.  This change allows postpartum 
Sailors time to fully recover in a healthy manner prior to being required to 
meet fitness and body composition standards. 
    a.  Postpartum Sailors will be required to participate in a wellness 
(unofficial) PFA between six to nine months postpartum, following a QBE as 
defined in line with reference (e).  The intent of this new policy is to 
assist postpartum Sailors return to PFA standards and provide commanding 
officers (CO) visibility on their health and fitness level. 
        (1) Postpartum Sailors will obtain a medical clearance form (NAVMED 
Form 6110/4) by HCP or Authorized Medical Department Assessment prior to 
participating in the wellness PFA.  If not cleared to participate, a 
postpartum Sailor will be rescreened as appropriate prior to participating in 
the wellness PFA. 
        (2) Upon receiving medical clearance, postpartum Sailors will 
participate in a wellness PFA.  If a postpartum Sailor passes the wellness 
PFA, they can return to command/unit physical training.  If a postpartum 
Sailor fails to screen, they will be provided postpartum nutrition and 
fitness resources to assist with their postpartum recovery. 
    b.  Pregnancy and Postpartum Physical Training resources will be 
available in July 2021 to assist Sailors.  These resources will include 
information on pregnancy/postpartum nutrition and a safe physical training 
program complete with recommended exercises and contraindicated exercises. 
These resources will be available on the MyNavy HR Website 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/21st-Century-Sailor/Physical- 
Readiness/
