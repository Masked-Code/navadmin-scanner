RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the renewal and modification of Naval 
Special Warfare Officer Continuation Pay (NSWOCP) for qualified Sea, Air, and 
Land (SEAL) officers.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a).  Retaining 
talented SEAL officers is a priority for the Navy.  NSWOCP is a monetary 
incentive that focuses on improving retention of junior and mid-grade SEAL 
officers.  SEAL officers who meet the eligibility criteria in this NAVADMIN 
and hold an 1130 or 1137 designator may apply for this incentive.

2.  Program Overview.  This bonus is authorized under Section 332 of 
reference (b) and reference (c).  As of 2 May 2024, eligible officers will be 
offered the opportunity to commit to a 3-year or 4- year phase 1 agreement 
and a 3-year, 4-year, or 5-year phase 2 agreement for bonus amounts listed in 
paragraph 4.  The Naval Special Warfare Plans and Policy Branch (OPNAV N137) 
is designated as the NSWOCP Program Manager.  All applications for this bonus 
will be submitted to the program manager for approval, payment processing, 
and tracking.  The eligibility criteria stated in this NAVADMIN can be 
subsequently modified by the program manager if a bonus reduction is 
warranted based on Naval Special Warfare (NSW) community requirements.

3.  Eligibility.  NSW officers with designators 1130 or 1137, who have 
completed at least six years of Active Duty Commissioned Service (ADCS), may 
be eligible to receive the NSWOCP.  Applicants must submit written 
endorsement from Commanding Officer (CO) recommending bonus approval.  COs 
must ensure applications are accurate and verify applicants meet eligibility 
requirements.

4.  Contract Terms.  NSWOCP contract lengths and payments are outlined below.

weeks after all eligibility criteria are met.

reference (b), sections 332 and 373, and reference (d).  A member of the 
uniformed Services who enters into a written agreement with specified service 
conditions for receipt of a bonus is entitled to the full amount of the bonus 
if the member fulfills the conditions of that written agreement.  If the 
member fails to fulfill the service conditions specified in the written 
agreement for the pay, then the pay may be terminated and the member may be 
required to repay an amount equal to the unearned portion of the pay.
