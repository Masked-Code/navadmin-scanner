RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Naval Special Warfare Officer Retention 
Bonus (NSWRB) for qualified Naval Special Warfare (NSW) officers.  This 
NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a).  Retaining NSW officers is a priority for 
the Navy.  The NSWRB is a flexible retention incentive that focuses on 
improving retention of NSW control grade officers.  NSW officers who meet the 
eligibility criteria in this NAVADMIN and hold an 1130 or 1137 designator may 
apply for this incentive.

2.  Program Overview.  This bonus is authorized under reference (b), sections 
332 and 355.  Qualified officers will be offered the opportunity to commit to 
a five-year or a three-year agreement for bonus amounts listed in paragraph 
5.  NSW Officer Community Manager
(BUPERS-311D) is designated as the NSWRB Program Manager.  All applications 
for this bonus will be submitted to the program manager for approval, payment 
processing and tracking.  The eligibility criteria stated in this NAVADMIN 
can be changed at any time by the program manager if a bonus reduction is 
warranted based on the needs of the NSW community.

3.  Program Eligibility.  NSW officers with designators 1130 or 1137, who 
have completed at least 15 years of active-duty commissioned service (ADCS), 
may be offered the NSWRB.  Applicants must meet the following eligibility 
criteria:
    a.  designated as a NSW officer (designator 1130 or 1137).
    b.  receive the written endorsement from the commanding officer (CO).  CO 
must ensure applications are accurate and verify applicants meet eligibility 
requirements.

4.  Program Execution
    a.  Officers must submit their request letter to the NSWRB program 
manager via their chain of command.
    b.  Officers will receive their bonus amount upon agreement acceptance 
and then annual anniversary payments through the term of the agreement.
    c.  When the officer agreement has been accepted by the program manager, 
the amount of the bonus becomes fixed and the officer incurs a firm service 
obligation.
    d.  NSWRB requests for personnel who are being processed for officer 
designation removal or additional qualification designation removal will be 
held in abeyance pending final resolution of the action in question.

5.  NSWRB contract lengths and payments are outlined below.
    a.  The NSWRB will be offered in two phases.  Officers will be paid a 
fixed amount per year of service.  If an officer serves a partial year, that 
year will be prorated.

1130 or 1137 designator and screened positive at a NSW CO/executive officer
