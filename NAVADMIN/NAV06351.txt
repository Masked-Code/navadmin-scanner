SUBJ/TASK FORCE UNIFORM UPDATE// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR 
THE NEW E-1 THROUGH O-10 NAVY WORKING UNIFORM AND THE E1 THROUGH
E6 YEAR ROUND SERVICE UNIFORM.  IT IS THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF MESSAGES 
TO INFORM OUR SAILORS AND PREPARE THEM FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THESE 
NEW UNIFORMS.
2.  INTRODUCTION OF THE NAVY WORKING UNIFORM AND SERVICE UNIFORM WILL 
OCCUR OVER A 24 MONTH PERIOD USING NAVY EXCHANGE UNIFORM CENTERS 
BEGINNING IN THE SUMMER OF 2008.  FLEET OUTFITTING WILL BE INCREMENTAL 
AND START FIRST WITH THE LARGEST FLEET CONCENTRATION AREAS.  RECRUIT 
TRAINING COMMAND GREAT LAKES WILL BEGIN RECEIVING THE NEW UNIFORMS IN 
THE BEGINNING OF FY-09.  UNIFORMS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL REGIONS 
WITHIN 24 MONTHS OF THE INITIAL ROLLOUT.
3.  THIS UNIFORM INTRODUCTION APPROACH PERMITS FLEXIBILITY DURING THE 
UNIFORM PHASE-IN PROCESS (TO MANAGE RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY WITHIN 
EXISTING LOGISTICAL CONSTRAINTS), ENSURES THE NEW UNIFORMS CONFORM TO 
FLEET STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS, AND FACILITATES THE PHASE OUT OF 
THOSE UNIFORMS ITEMS THAT WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE SEABAG.  DURING THE 
24 MONTH PHASE-IN PERIOD BOTH CURRENT AND NEW UNIFORMS WILL BE 
AUTHORIZED FOR WEAR.
4.  TO HELP ENLISTED SAILORS PURCHASE THE NEW UNIFORMS DURING THE 
PHASE-IN PERIOD, ANNUAL CLOTHING REPLACEMENT ALLOWANCES WILL INCREASE 
IN FY-08 AND FY-09.  DRILLING RESERVISTS (E-1 THROUGH E-9), WILL 
RECEIVE NEW UNIFORMS THROUGH THEIR NAVY OPERATIONAL SUPPORT COMMAND.
5.  NAVY UNIFORM REGULATIONS ARE BEING REVISED TO REFLECT POLICY 
GUIDANCE ON THE MANNER AND OCCASIONS FOR WEAR FOR THE NAVY WORKING 
UNIFORM AND SERVICE UNIFORM.  A COMPLETELY REVISED UNIFORM REGULATION 
MANUAL WILL BE ISSUED PRIOR TO THE ROLL OUT OF THESE NEW UNIFORMS.
DURING THE TWO-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD, SAILORS ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN 
A COMPLETE INVENTORY OF SEA BAG ITEMS REFLECTING A PROFESSIONAL 
APPEARANCE.
6.  ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE ROLLOUT OF THE NEW UNIFORMS AND OTHER 
TASK FORCE UNIFORM INITIATIVES WILL BE ANNOUNCED VIA FUTURE NAVADMINS 
AND POSTED ON THE TASK FORCE UNIFORM WEB SITE AT
