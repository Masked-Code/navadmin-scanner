RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN promulgates Navy policy eliminating the requirement for vehicle decals (DD 
FORM 2220) for base access, effective 1 July 2013. 

2.  Background:  Refs A through D state access to property and installations shall be accomplished by 
vetting personal identity information to determine the eligibility of an individual requesting and 
requiring access to Department of Defense facilities, thereby eliminating the decal (DD FORM 2220) 
requirement for access.  Ref A further states that vehicles on a Navy installation must continue to be 
licensed, registered, inspected, and insured in accordance with state and local laws.  Rental vehicles are 
considered privately-owned vehicles for purposes of base entry and access control.  The vehicle rental 
contract will suffice as proper licensing, registration, and proof of insurance for base access. 

3.  Implementation:  CNIC will provide an implementation plan via a NAVSHORE message for decal 
elimination to include the following:
    A.  Concept of Operations (CONOPS):  Activity parking plans; motorcycle safety training (that is not 
dependant on display of the decal); barment control; enforcement of state licensing, registration, 
insurance, and safety requirements through random anti-terrorism measures; CLEOC registration 
process ensuring compliance with the Clean Air Act, etc.
    B.  A standard communications package will includes FAQs, briefing cards, and other associated 
communication products for installations to provide information to tenant activities in preparation for 
decal elimination.  CNIC PAO will coordinate with CHINFO AND Region PAOs to disseminate.
    C.  A POA&M defining the phased implementation.
