GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE WILL CONTINUE THE BLUE
TO GREEN PROGRAM THROUGH FY-06.  THIS PROGRAM OFFERS TRANSITIONING
SAILORS THE OPTION OF CONTINUING ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE WITH THE ARMY,
WITHOUT ANY BREAK IN SERVICE.  SAILORS RETAIN THE BENEFITS OF ACTIVE
SERVICE WHILE USING THE VALUABLE TRAINING, KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND
ABILITIES DEVELOPED IN THE NAVY.  TRANSITION TO THE ARMY MAY BE
PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL FOR SAILORS SEPARATING FROM THE NAVY UNDER
PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS), E-4 HIGH YEAR TENURE (HYT), OR JUNIOR
OFFICERS SUBJECT TO INVOLUNTARY RELEASE FROM ACTIVE DUTY (IRAD).
THE ARMY IS CURRENTLY OFFERING A BLUE TO GREEN ENLISTMENT BONUS OF
UP TO 10,000 DOLLARS FOR CERTAIN MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTIES
(MOS).
2.  ARMY RECRUITING COMMAND HAS CONTRACTED ALL INCONUS BLUE TO GREEN
RECRUITING RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE SERCO CORPORATION.  THEREFORE,
MANY INCONUS ARMY RECRUITERS HAVE LIMITED BLUE TO GREEN PROGRAM
KNOWLEDGE.  INTERESTED SAILORS SHOULD CALL (866) 801-2980, OR EMAIL
BLUE2GREEN(AT)HOFFMAN.ARMY.MIL OR VISIT THE ARMY WEBSITE
WWW.GOARMY.COM/BTG.INDEX.JSP.
3.  COMMANDS ARE REQUIRED TO ASSIST ELIGIBLE SAILORS WHO EXPRESS
INTEREST IN THIS VOLUNTARY PROGRAM, IN PART, BY AIDING THE SAILOR TO
COMPLETE THE FORM (DD 368).  SAILORS SHOULD OBTAIN THE REQUIRED DD
368 THROUGH THEIR SERCO ARMY RECRUITER.  THE ARMY USES THE DD
368 TO COORDINATE SEPARATION INFORMATION THAT WILL BE CONTAINED
LATER IN THE DD 214.  ARMY RECRUITING REQUESTS NAVY HELP TO ENSURE
THE FOLLOWING DATA IS CONTAINED IN THE REMARKS SECTION OF THE DD
368:  LAST DAY OF ACTIVE DUTY (EAOS), RE-ENLISTMENT ELIGIBILITY CODE
(RE CODE), SEPARATION PROGRAM DESIGNATION CODE (SPD), NARRATIVE TO
EXPLAIN THE SPD, RATE/OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTY, LEAVE BALANCE TO BE
CARRIED OVER TO THE ARMY, DAYS OF LOST TIME.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
CONCERNING THE DD 368 IS FOUND IN REF (A).
4.  THE FOLLOWING GENERALIZED BLUE TO GREEN PROCESS OVERVIEW WILL
FAMILIARIZE SAILORS WITH THE BLUE TO GREEN PROCESS AND GIVE SAILORS
AN IDEA OF WHAT TO EXPECT.  ONCE THE DD 368 AND THE ASSOCIATED
PRE-ENLISTMENT PAPERWORK ARE COMPLETED, THE SAILOR WILL PROCEED BY
DIRECTION OF THEIR RECRUITER TO THE NEAREST MILITARY ENTRANCE
PROCESSING STATION (MEPS).  AT MEPS, THE SAILOR WILL SELECT THEIR
MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTY.  THE SAILOR WILL RECEIVE A JOB
RESERVATION FORM THAT GUARANTEES THE JOB, BONUS, AND/OR DUTY
ASSIGNMENT.  THE SAILOR WILL THEN SERVE OUT THEIR NAVY OBLIGATION
(IN THE NAVY) UNTIL EAOS.  AFTER RECEIVING THEIR NAVY DISCHARGE, THE
SAILOR WILL NORMALLY SHIP OUT FOR THE ARMY THE DAY AFTER THEIR EAOS
(OR SHORTLY THEREAFTER).  SAILORS WILL BE REQUIRED TO SHIP OUT FROM
THE INITIAL PROCESSING MEPS.
