RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the Fall Fiscal Year (FY) 
2020 Full-Time Support (FTS) Officer Transfer and Redesignation Board on 29 
October 2019.  Applications from qualified Active Component (AC) and Selected 
Reserve (SELRES) officers will be considered by this board.  In line with 
reference (a), this board will also accept applications from FTS officers 
requesting redesignation into another FTS officer community.

2.  Application requirements and procedures can be found via MyNavy Portal 
at:  https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/career-planning and selecting the FTS 
Redesignation Boards link.  Complete applications with associated enclosures 
must be received no later than (NLT) 2359 on 30 September 2019.

3.  Eligibility
    a.  All applicants must meet eligibility requirements outlined in 
reference (a) and the Fall FY-20 FTS eligibility criteria document found on 
the redesignation website.  Specific eligibility requirements are described 
for each designator and aviation community.  General eligibility criteria 
include projected rotation date (PRD), minimum service requirement (MSR), 
year group (YG) and aviation bonus (AvB) contracts.
        (1) PRD.  Applicants should have a PRD NLT
30 April 2021.  Waiver requests must be endorsed by the commanding officer of 
the applicant.
        (2) MSR.  AC applicants should have completed their MSR prior to 30 
April 2021.  Waiver requests (no additional paperwork required by the 
applicant) will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the AC officer 
community manager (OCM).
        (3) AvB.  Aviation officers with obligated service as a result of AvB 
are eligible to apply if the officer will be within 12 months of completing 
AvB obligation or department head tour at the time the board convenes.  
Redesignation immediately following a department head tour may result in 
cancellation of AvB, which will be adjudicated by Aviation Officer 
Assignments (PERS-43).
        (4) Failure of Selection (FOS).  AC officers in a 2xFOS status for 
promotion to LCDR are eligible to apply for FTS regardless of MSR and AvB 
contract term, a waiver request is not required.
        (5) YG.  The tentative YG considerations are indicated below.  The 
final approved YGs are posted on the FTS OCM webpage along with the remainder 
of the application data.
