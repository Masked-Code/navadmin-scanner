RMKS/1. This NAVADMIN promulgates CNOIVA, DCIP and MAA-N(P) assess-ment 
schedule for FY15.  Changes were made based on installation operational 
commitment conflicts or changes in assessment priorities.

2. References (a) and (b) require Navy commands that have an Antiterrorism 
program to undergo a higher headquarters integrated vulnerability assessment 
(CNOIVA) using reference (c).  Other commands require an assessment based on 
the critical infrastructure program criteria.  These are annotated by *CIP.* 
The development of the Navy*s Mission Assurance assessment program drives the
MAA-N pilot assessment which consists of two phases: a pre-assessment site 
visit for installation and mission data gathering and the on-site assessment.  
See reference (d) for more detail on these programs.
