REF/B/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON DC/N1/110033ZJUL09// 
NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 187/09, PROVIDING INFORMATION ON POST 9-11 GI 
BILL ELIGIBILITY AND ENTITLEMENT.  REF B IS NAVADMIN 203/09, PROVIDING 
POLICY AND GUIDELINES FOR TRANSFERABILITY OF ENTITLEMENT TO FAMILY 
MEMBERS// RMKS/1.  THIS IS THE THIRD IN A SERIES OF NAVADMINS THAT 
ADDRESS THE POST 9-11 GI BILL.  THIS NAVADMIN UPDATES EXISTING GUIDANCE 
AND ESTABLISHES POLICY FOR LIMITED DUTY (LIMDU) PERSONNEL WHO DESIRE TO 
TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT.
2.  DUE TO THE HIGH NUMBER OF VETERANS, ACTIVE DUTY AND RESERVISTS FROM 
ALL BRANCHES WHO ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THEIR GI BILL EDUCATION 
ENTITLEMENT, PROCESSING FOR CERTIFICATES OF ELIGIBILITY
(COE) HAS SEEN DELAYS.  A COE IS PROOF OF PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY AND IS 
USED BY THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTION TO PROCESS ENROLLMENT CERTIFICATES.  
TO REDUCE THE TIME IT TAKES FOR PAYMENT, THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS 
AFFAIRS (DVA) IS PROCESSING ENROLLMENT CERTIFICATES BEFORE COES.  DVA 
HAS ASKED ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS TO PROCESS ENROLLMENTS WITHOUT THE COE 
FROM THE MEMBER.  MEMBERS WHO HAVE NOT RECEIVED THEIR COE SHOULD 
CONTACT THE VA COUNSELOR AT THEIR ACADEMIC INSTITUTION FOR ASSISTANCE.  
MONTHLY AND BOOK STIPENDS, ON THE AVERAGE, ARE MAILED OUT 35 DAYS AFTER 
THE ENROLLMENT CERTIFICATE IS RECEIVED BY THE DVA.
3.  REF B PROVIDED POLICY FOR COMPLETING REQUIRED SERVICE OBLIGATION.  
A TRANSFERABILITY APPLICATION WILL NOT BE APPROVED UNTIL THE SERVICE 
OBLIGATION IS RECORDED IN THE MEMBER'S ELECTRONIC SERVICE RECORD (ESR).  
MEMBERS SHOULD DISCUSS THE REQUIRED SERVICE OBLIGATION WITH CAREER 
COUNSELORS BEFORE APPLYING FOR TRANSFERABILITY.  THIS WILL ALLOW A 
SERVICEMEMBER'S APPLICATION TO BE PROCESSED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND 
AVOID REJECTION.  
4.  PER REF B, AFTER 31 DECEMBER 2009, SHORT TERM EXTENSIONS WILL NO 
LONGER BE AUTHORIZED FOR THE PURPOSE OF POST 9-11 TRANSFERABILITY.  IN 
ADDITION, THE EXCEPTION TO THE REENLISTMENT POLICY THAT ALLOWS A MEMBER 
TO REENLIST OUT OF CYCLE FOR LESS THAN 4 YEARS WILL NO LONGER BE IN 
EFFECT.  ON 1 JANUARY 2010, ALL ENLISTED SERVICEMEMBERS WHO WISH TO 
TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT TO A FAMILY MEMBER MUST REENLIST FOR THE TIME 
REQUIRED TO MEET THE SERVICE OBLIGATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH CURRENT 
REENLISTMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES.
5.  THE FOLLOWING POLICY APPLIES FOR PERSONNEL IN A LIMDU STATUS WHO 
REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL SERVICE OBLIGATION FOR TRANSFERABILITY:
    A.  SERVICEMEMBERS MUST WAIT UNTIL A FINAL DETERMINATION OF MEDICAL 
STATUS HAS BEEN COMPLETED.
        (1) IF CLEARED FOR DUTY AND DETERMINED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR 
CONTINUED SERVICE, MEMBER MUST FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES AS PER REF B.
        (2) SERVICEMEMBERS ALREADY DESIGNATED FOR A MEDICAL DISCHARGE, 
AND WHO HAVE COMPLETED AT LEAST TEN YEARS OF SERVICE IN THE ARMED 
FORCES, MAY ELECT TRANSFERABILITY WITH NO ADDITIONAL SERVICE OBLIGATION, 
HOWEVER, THE ELECTION MUST BE MADE PRIOR TO SEPARATION AND THE SAILOR 
MUST BE AWARDED AN HONORABLE DISCHARGE.
    B.  SERVICEMEMBERS WHO ARE APPROVED FOR TRANSFERABILITY AND THEN 
ARE SUBSEQUENTLY MEDICALLY DISCHARGED BEFORE COMPLETING THEIR SERVICE 
OBLIGATION MAY RETAIN TRANSFERABILITY PROVIDED THE MEDICAL DISCHARGE IS 
NOT A RESULT OF WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.
