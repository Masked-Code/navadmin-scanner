SUBJ/E5 HIGH YEAR TENURE (HYT) AT 14 YEARS// 
RMKS/1.  THE E5 HIGH YEAR TENURE (HYT) GATE OF 14 YEARS LENGTH OF 
SERVICE FOR ACTIVE, FULL TIME SUPPORT (FTS) AND USNR PERSONNEL SERVING 
ON ACTIVE DUTY FOR A MINIMUM OF TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS WAS ANNOUNCED IN 
NAVADMIN 056/05 IN MARCH 2005 AND CAN BE READ IN ITS ENTIRETY IN 
MILPERSMAN 1160-120.  THIS POLICY CHANGE WAS DESIGNED WITH A FOUR-YEAR 
DELAY TO PREVENT DISADVANTAGING E5 SAILORS BETWEEN
10-14 YEARS OF SERVICE WHEN THE POLICY WAS APPROVED BY SECNAV IN MARCH 
OF 2005.  THIS MESSAGE SERVES AS A REMINDER TO SAILORS AND NAVY 
LEADERSHIP OF THE IMPENDING EXECUTION OF E5 HYT AT 14 YEARS.  
TO ASSIST CAREER PLANNING, OPTIONS FOR E5 SAILORS WHO ARE AT RISK OF 
HYT AT 14 YEARS ARE DESCRIBED IN PARAS 3-6 OF THIS MESSAGE.  
ADDITIONALLY, AN ACTION TIMELINE, PARA 7, IS PROVIDED FOR SAILORS WHO 
PLAN TO REQUEST A RATING CONVERSION OR HYT WAIVER.  THIS INFORMATION IS 
PURPOSELY PUBLISHED IN ADVANCE SO SAILORS AND COMMANDS HAVE TIME TO 
CONDUCT CAREER DEVELOPMENT BOARDS AND MAKE THE BEST CAREER DECISION FOR 
THE SAILOR AND THE NAVY.  WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE ANY SAILOR WHO MAY HAVE 
QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS REGARDING THE HYT POLICY TO USE THEIR CHAIN OF 
COMMAND AND CONTACT THEIR RESPECTIVE ENLISTED COMMUNITY MANAGER (ECM). 
2.  E5 SAILORS WITH LESS THAN 10 YEARS TOTAL ACTIVE MILITARY SERVICE 
(INCLUDES TIME IN OTHER SERVICES OR PRIOR SERVICE) ON
1 JULY 2005 ARE SUBJECT TO THE 14-YEAR E5 HYT GATE REGARDLESS OF THEIR 
CURRENT CONTRACT EXPIRATION.  THESE SAILORS START TO REACH THIS 14-YEAR 
HYT GATE BEGINNING ON 2 JULY 2009. 
3.  HYT WAIVER REQUESTS:  HYT WAIVERS WILL BE CONSIDERED ON A CASE-BY-
CASE BASIS.  THE MANNING OF THE RATING WITH RESPECT TO PAYGRADE, YEAR 
GROUP INVENTORY, AND NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION (NEC) CODE ARE KEY 
FACTORS IN THE WAIVER DECISION.  WAIVER REQUESTS MAY BE SUBMITTED IAW 
MILPERSMAN 1160-120.  COMMAND CAREER COUNSELORS AND SAILORS SHALL 
DISCUSS INDIVIDUAL WAIVER REQUESTS WITH THE APPROPRIATE ECM PRIOR TO 
SUBMITTING THE REQUEST.  THE WAIVER REQUEST SHOULD BE SUBMITTED 10 
MONTHS PRIOR TO THE HYT DATE, BUT MUST, AT A MINIMUM, BE SUBMITTED SIX 
MONTHS PRIOR TO THE HYT DATE.  
4.  RATING CONVERSION:  SAILORS WHO ARE NOT GOOD CANDIDATES FOR A HYT 
WAIVER SHOULD CONSIDER A LATERAL CONVERSION TO A RATING UNDERMANNED AT 
THE E5 PAY GRADE, OR TO A RATING THAT MAY BE UNDERMANNED WITHIN THEIR 
SPECIFIC YEAR GROUP.  COMMAND CAREER COUNSELORS SHOULD CONTACT THE ECM 
OF THE SPECIFIC RATINGS THE SAILOR IS CONSIDERING.  FLEET RIDE, 
HTTPS://FLEETRIDE.SSCNO.NMCI.NAVY.MIL/  SHALL BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE 
THAT THE SAILOR IS FULLY QUALIFIED FOR THE RATING REQUESTED.  SAILORS 
MUST SUBMIT CONVERSION REQUESTS IAW MILPERSMAN 1440-010 VIA THEIR 
COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR AND THEIR CHAIN OF COMMAND.  SAILORS APPROVED 
FOR CONVERSION WILL BE GRANTED A HYT WAIVER ONCE THE SAILOR HAS 
COMPLETED TRAINING AND HAS FULLY CONVERTED TO THE NEW RATING. 
5.  TRANSITION TO THE NAVY SELECTED RESERVE (SELRES):  SAILORS WITH 
FLEET EXPERIENCE ARE A VALUABLE ASSET IN THE NAVY SELECTED RESERVE 
COMPONENT (RC).  IAW MILPERSMAN 1160-130, THE HYT GATE FOR E5 SELRES 
SAILORS IS 22 YEARS.  SAILORS TRANSITIONING TO THE NAVY RESERVE MAY BE 
ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR CURRENT RATING OR CONVERT TO AN UNDERMANNED NAVY 
RESERVE RATING.  IN ADDITION TO THE CAMARADERIE, PRIDE, AND PATRIOTISM 
THAT COME FROM STAYING NAVY, THE BENEFITS OF THE RESERVES INCLUDE

UNDER THE 'ENLISTED OPPORTUNITIES' LINK OR AT WWW.NAVYRESERVE.COM.  
SAILORS DESIRING AN OPPORTUNITY TO STAY NAVY WITHIN THE RC SHOULD 
CONTACT THEIR COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR FOR FURTHER GUIDANCE. 
6.  INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION:  IF A SAILOR DOES NOT RECEIVE A HYT WAIVER, 
CONVERT TO ANOTHER RATING OR TRANSITION TO THE SELRES AS DETAILED IN 
PARAS 3-5 ABOVE, THE SAILOR WILL BE INVOLUNTARILY SEPARATED AT HIS OR 
HER HYT DATE.  SERVICE MEMBERS SHOULD REFER TO OPNAVINST 1900.4 FOR 
GUIDANCE REGARDING SEPARATION PAY AND BENEFITS AND REFER TO BUPERSINST

ODDS OF THE SAILOR RECEIVING HIS/HER FIRST CHOICE OF OPTIONS.
9.  SAILORS AFFECTED BY THE E5 HYT GATE CHANGE SHOULD TAKE CHARGE OF 
THEIR CAREER AND ACT IMMEDIATELY.  THE FIRST STEP IS TO TALK WITH THEIR 
COMMAND CAREER COUNSELORS TO DISCUSS THE OPTIONS OUTLINED ABOVE.  
COMMANDS SHALL USE FLEET RIDE TO DETERMINE ADDITIONAL RATINGS FOR WHICH
