AMPN/REF A IS NAVADMIN 309/12 * Launch of the Chief of Naval Operations 
Professional Reading Program (CNO-PRP)//

RMKS/ 1. Additional sets of CNO Professional Reading Program books are now 
available for distribution to ships and stations on a first-come, first-
served basis. The 18 titles in this program are aligned with the three tenets 
outlined in the CNO*s Sailing
Directions:

C.  Be Ready
Initial book sets were distributed fleet-wide during the first quarter of FY-
13 and updated in May 2014.  Additional and/or replacement sets are now 
available at no cost to units interested in refreshing their professional 
libraries.

2. The 18 books that comprise the CNO-PRP are intended for the professional 
and personal development of our Sailors and Officers.
These books were specifically chosen by the CNO to illustrate the subjects of 
leadership, naval history, fleet operations, international relations, 
cultural diversity and naval strategy.
The books are:
A. *1812* by George Daughan
B. "Cyber Security and Cyber War* By P. W. Singer and A. Friedman C. *Seal of 
Honor* by Gary Williams D. "The Twilight War* by David Crist E. *Wake of the 
Wahoo* by Forest Sterling F. *Wired for War* by P. W. Singer G. *The Crisis 
of Islam* by Bernard Lewis H. *Execute Against Japan* by Joel Holwitt I.

Kaplan K. *Neptune*s Inferno* by James Hornfischer L. *Red Star Over the 
Pacific* by Toshi Yoshihara and James Holmes M. *A Sailor*s History of the 
U.S. Navy* by Thomas Cutler N. *In the Shadow of Greatness* by J.Welle, J. 
Ennis, K. Kranz, and G. Plaster O. "Leading With the Heart* by Mike 
Krzyzewski and D. Philips P. *Navigating the Seven Seas* by Melvin Williams, 
Jr. and Melvin Williams, Sr.
Q. "The Trident* by Jason Redman and J. Bruning R. "Turn the Ship Around* by 
CAPT. David Marquet, USN (Ret.)

3. Sets of these 18 books will be sent to commands upon request from the CNO-
PRP management office at the Naval War College at
(401) 841-3145 or via e-mail at navyreading@usnwc.edu. Larger commands (over 
400 active duty personnel) may request multiple sets.
Books from previous lists should be retained to build a growing and versatile 
lending library for the command. Internal control procedures should be 
established to balance accountability for the books and accessibility to them 
on a loan basis.

4. In addition to the 18-book sets being offered in this message, a number of 
current and previous CNO-PRP titles are available for free loan as e-books 
and/or digital audio downloads from the Navy Library E-Content section within 
the Navy General Library Program
(NGLP) portal. The NGLP site also provides access to thousands of other free 
books, magazines, and periodicals. Check with your command information 
assurance manager or network administrator for details on how to access this 
online content at your command. For Sailors who prefer to purchase their own 
copies, hard-copy books are available at many Navy Exchange (NEX) outlets, or 
online at www.my navyexhcange.com under CNO-PRP books in the uniform sales 
section.

5. The CNO-PRP book listing is not intended to limit professional reading to 
only these titles, but rather to provide easy access to some of the many 
titles that are particularly relevant to today*s Sailors. The entire list, 
with book summaries and additional information, is available at 
http://navyreading.dodlive.mil/ navyreading.navy.mil. The CNO-PRP management 
office at the Naval War College welcomes any questions and feedback about the 
CNO-PRP, including recommendations for books to be added to the program in 
the future.

6. Active participation in the CNO-PRP is highly encouraged.
The intent of this program is to help extend Sailors* personal and 
professional growth beyond their day-to-day duties. Since the program*s 
inception, many commands have established reading groups, essay contests and 
special liberty programs to reward their dedicated professional readers. 
Reading, discussing and understanding the ideas found in the CNO-PRP will not 
only improve our critical thinking skills but will also help us become better 
Sailors, better citizens, and, most importantly, better leaders.

7. Released by RADM P. GARDNER HOWE III, President, Naval War College.
