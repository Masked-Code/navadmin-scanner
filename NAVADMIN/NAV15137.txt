AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 3590.11F, THE ARLEIGH BURKE FLEET TROPHY/MARJORIE 
STERRETT BATTLESHIP FUND AWARD/USS ARIZONA MEMORIAL TROPHY//

RMKS/1.  The Arleigh Burke fleet trophy is awarded annually to one ship or 
aircraft squadron from each coast for achieving the greatest improvement in 
battle efficiency based on the battle efficiency competition.

2.  It is an honor to announce the calendar year 2014 Arleigh Burke fleet 
trophy award recipients for their superior performance and improvement in 
battle efficiency:
    a.  Atlantic fleet:  USS ROSS (DDG 71)
    b.  Pacific fleet:  USS COLUMBIA (SSN 771)

3.  Selection for this award is a reflection of the quality and tenacity of 
these commands.
    a.  USS ROSS (DDG 71) spent 2014 preparing herself for forward deployment 
to Rota, Spain and then executing a home port move in addition to a 
challenging basic training phase, INSURV, and recovering from a long 2013 
maintenance period.  The sustained success achieved throughout that period is 
a testament to the ship's motivated Sailors, superb leadership, tactical 
innovation, and unrelenting drive to elevate USS ROSS (DDG 71) to the 
pinnacle of success.
    b.  USS COLUMBIA's (SSN 771) performance during 2014 was impressive.
The crew's tenacious focus on self assessment and improvement in engineering 
readiness, personnel and supply management, and tactical capability 
culminated in the ship's phenomenal performance during a six month western 
pacific deployment.

4.  Congratulations to USS ROSS (DDG 71) and USS COLUMBIA (SSN 71) for their 
continued dedication to duty and commitment to excellence.

5.  Released by Vice Admiral J. F. Caldwell, JR., Director, Navy Staff.//
