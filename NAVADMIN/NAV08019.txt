RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN, THE FOURTH IN A SERIES CONCERNING THE JOINT 
QUALIFICATION SYSTEM (JQS), ANNOUNCES THE FIRST JOINT QUALIFICATION 
REVIEW PANEL TO BE HELD BY THE JOINT STAFF 25-29 FEBRUARY.
2.  AS OUTLINED IN REFS A THRU D, THE JQS REPLACES THE PREVIOUS 
DESIGNATION OF JOINT SPECIALTY OFFICER (JSO) WITH THE NEW DESIGNATION, 
JOINT QUALIFIED OFFICER (JQO).  OFFICERS CONTINUE TO BE REQUIRED TO 
COMPLETE JOINT PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION (JPME) PHASES I AND II 
FOR DESIGNATION AS JQO (RESERVISTS WILL GENERALLY SUBSTITUTE ADVANCED 
JPME FOR PHASE II).  ALTHOUGH THE PRIMARY MEANS TO ACHIEVE JOINT 
EXPERIENCE WILL REMAIN THROUGH AN ASSIGNMENT TO A JOINT BILLET LISTED 
ON THE JOINT DUTY ASSIGNMENT LIST (JDAL), THE JQS ALLOWS OFFICERS TO 
ACCUMULATE POINTS TOWARD JOINT QUALIFICATION THROUGH A COMBINATION OF 
JOINT EDUCATION, JOINT EXPERIENCE, JOINT
TRAINING, JOINT EXERCISES AND OTHER MILITARY EDUCATION.   
3.  THE JQS SELF-NOMINATION WEB SITE, LOCATED AT 
HTTPS://WWW.DMDC.OSD.MIL/JQS/, (USE ALL LOWER CASE), IS ON-LINE AND HAS 
BEEN ACCEPTING SUBMISSIONS SINCE 1 OCT 07.  OFFICERS MAY SELF-NOMINATE 
THEIR JOINT EXPERIENCES ON THE WEB SITE FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE REVIEW 
PANEL TO AWARD POINT CREDIT.  THE WEBSITE PROVIDES DIRECTIONS FOR SELF-
NOMINATION, AS WELL AS HOW TO SEND HARD COPY DATA SUPPORTING THE 
REQUESTS FOR JOINT CREDIT.  ADDITIONAL JQS INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND ON 
THE NPC JOINT OFFICER MATTERS WEBSITE AT 
WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/OFFICER/JOINTOFFICER.  OFFICERS MUST HAVE COMPLETED 
THE EXPERIENCE TOUR FOR WHICH THEY ARE SELF-NOMINATING. 
THE WEBSITE SHOULD NOT BE USED TO SELF-NOMINATE FOR JPME COMPLETION.  
GUIDANCE FOR SUBMISSION OF REQUESTS FOR POINTS FOR OTHER JOINT 
EDUCATION, TRAINING AND JOINT EXERCISES WILL BE PROMULGATED AT A LATER 
DATE.
4.  THE 25-29 FEBRUARY PANEL WILL CONSIDER SUBMISSIONS FROM OFFICERS IN 
PAYGRADES O-6 AND O-5 FROM BOTH ACTIVE AND RESERVE COMPONENTS SUBMITTED 
PRIOR TO 1 JAN 08.  ONLY RESERVE OFFICER SUBMISSIONS FOR PERIODS OF 
EXTENDED ACTIVE DUTY WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THIS PANEL. PRIORITY REVIEW 
WILL BE GIVEN FOR OFFICERS WHO HAVE COMPLETED JPME I AND II, OR AJPME.  
ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS PANEL MUST BE RECEIVED 
BY THE NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND BY 28 JAN 08.  ELIGIBLE SUBMISSIONS NOT 
REVIEWED BY THIS PANEL WILL BE REVIEWED BY SUBSEQUENT PANELS TO BE HELD 
APPROXIMATELY EVERY 60 TO 90 DAYS.
5.  IT IS VITAL FOR OFFICERS TO PROVIDE AS MUCH SUPPORTING 
DOCUMENTATION AS POSSIBLE.  OFFICERS MUST EXPLAIN CLEARLY IN THE 
NARRATIVE PART OF THEIR JOINT EXPERIENCE SELF-NOMINATION INPUTS WHAT 
THEIR DUTIES ENTAILED AND HOW THEY MET THE DEFINITION OF JOINT MATTERS 
CONTAINED IN REF D.  OFFICERS SHOULD FORWARD SUFFICIENT SUPPORTING 
MATERIAL TO ALLOW JQS PANELS TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE JOINT NATURE OF 
THE EXPERIENCE AND THE TYPE OF FORCE TO WHICH ASSIGNED.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
AN OFFICER ON AN INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION ASSIGNMENT MAY INCLUDE A 
LETTER FROM HIS/HER (JOINT, COALITION, OTHER SERVICE, INTERAGENCY, AND
NON-GOVERNMENTAL) SENIOR DETAILING THE JOINT NATURE OF THE ASSIGNMENT, 
ALONG WITH FITNESS REPORTS AND AWARD CITATIONS AS APPROPRIATE.  
SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION MUST CLEARLY INDICATE THE START AND END DATE 
OF THE ASSIGNMENT.
    A.  IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT THAT PERFORMANCE REPORTS/ EVALUATIONS, 
AND AWARDS, AS APPROPRIATE, CLEARLY ARTICULATE ACTIONS RELATED TO THE 
OFFICER?S DUTIES RELATING TO JOINT MATTERS. 
OFFICERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO USE QUOTES, AS APPLICABLE, FROM THESE 
DOCUMENTS IN THE NARRATIVE PART OF THEIR JOINT EXPERIENCE SELF- 
NOMINATION INPUTS.
    B.  OFFICERS IN THE RESERVE COMPONENT SHOULD EXPLAIN WHETHER THEIR 
EXPERIENCES WERE GAINED DURING AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF ACTIVE DUTY (I.E., 
IA OR ADSW) OR AS PART OF NORMAL RESERVE UNIT DUTIES AND ANNUAL 
TRAINING.
    C.  PANELS WILL UNDERSTANDABLY LOOK FOR MORE RIGOR IN AN OFFICER?S 
JUSTIFYING DOCUMENTATION FOR JOINT EXPERIENCE REQUESTS FOR PERIODS 
WHILE SERVING IN OWN-SERVICE POSITIONS. IN THESE CASES, THERE MUST BE 
CLEAR AND COMPELLING INDICATION THAT THE OFFICER WAS REGULARLY INVOLVED 
IN DUTIES MEETING THE DEFINITION OF JOINT MATTERS.
    D.  OFFICERS SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR IN EXPLAINING ANY UNIT OR 
POSITIONAL DUAL-HAT ARRANGEMENTS/RELATIONSHIPS IN SUPPORT OF THEIR 
JOINT EXPERIENCE.  FOR EXAMPLE, CAREFULLY EXPLAINING THE NATURE OF DUTY 
IN OWN-SERVICE MILITARY UNITS THAT ALSO HAVE NATO OR STANDING JTF 
HEADQUARTERS DUAL-HATTED FUNCTIONS.
    E.  OFFICERS MUST ALSO CAREFULLY SPECIFY, IF THEY WERE SERVING IN 
POSITIONS THEY BELIEVED HAD A HIGHER THAN STEADY-STATE INTENSITY FACTOR, 
(E.G., 2 OR 3), WHEN THE HIGHER INTENSITY PERIOD BEGAN AND ENDED, AND 
THE UNIT THEY WERE ASSIGNED TO AT THE TIME.  OFFICERS SHOULD PROVIDE 
JUSTIFYING DOCUMENTS, SUCH AS LEAVE AND EARNINGS STATEMENT INFORMATION, 
SHOWING RECEIPT OF HOSTILE FIRE PAY/IMMINENT DANGER PAY TO SUPPORT 
REQUESTED PERIODS FOR INTENSITY FACTOR 3.
6.  BOTH ACTIVE AND RESERVE OFFICERS MAY SUBMIT PACKAGES FOR EXPERIENCE 
TOURS RETROACTIVE TO 11 SEPTEMBER 2001.  ADDITIONALLY, RESERVE OFFICERS 
MAY SUBMIT PACKAGES FOR EXPERIENCE TOURS IN A JDAL TYPE BILLET (I.E., 
OSD, JOINT STAFF, COCOM HEADQUARTERS) RETROACTIVE TO 1 OCTOBER 1986.  
CONTACT PERS-45J FOR QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO ELIGIBLE EXPERIENCES PRIOR 
TO SUBMITTING SELF- NOMINATIONS VIA THE DMDC WEBSITE.
