RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the highlights for fiscal year (FY)
2020 retention behavior, outlines the FY-21 retention environment, provides 
FY-21 reenlistment benchmarks and updates the FY-21 Retention Excellence 
Award (REA) criteria.  Additionally, it reemphasizes our commitment towards 
promoting a culture of excellence in line with reference (a) and the need to 
retain the best and brightest talent on our Navy team.

2.  FY-20 Retention Behavior.  In FY-20, the Navy achieved the following 
reenlistment rate attainment in Zones A, B, and C, which included Reserve 
affiliation:  69 percent for Zone A (57 percent benchmark), 76 percent for 
Zone B (67 percent benchmark) and 89 percent for Zone C (82 percent 
benchmark).  The Navy was able to meet and exceed these goals due to 
retaining Sailors within both the Active and Reserve Components and because 
of a considerable decrease in Zone A attrition.

3.  FY-21 Retention Environment.  Building upon the retention gains in the 
last few years, the Navy remains committed to retaining the right talent and 
experience in the right pay grades and ratings.
While we have grown over the years, some enlisted ratings have become 
overmanned, creating imbalances in the Fleet.  As we move into FY-21, the 
Navy will make a concerted effort to provide balanced enlisted ratings and 
improve community-rating health across the Fleet.  Part of this effort will 
include opening opportunities for Sailors to convert from overmanned to 
undermanned ratings.
Leadership and engagement at every level is needed to sustain our level of 
retention, with a renewed focus on strengthening undermanned ratings and 
providing for expanded career progression opportunities for our Sailors.

4.  FY-21 Retention Benchmarks.  In order to retain the right talent, with 
the right skills, in the right rating, we must continue to keep the press on.  
Echelon II and III commands must meet or exceed the aggregate reenlistment 
rates and attrition target set forth as follows:
Zone A (0 TO 6 Years of Service)          57 percent
Zone B (6 TO 10 Years of Service)         67 percent
Zone C (10 TO 14 Years of Service)        82 percent
Zone A Attrition                          4.5 percent or less
In FY-20, our Navy Reserve team provided outstanding support across the 
Fleet.  Our Reservists activated to ensure COVID-19 accountability reporting, 
filled vacant gaps at sea and special shore assignments as recruiters and 
trainers at recruit training command and so much more.  The Navy Reserve team 
consistently and effortlessly supports our global efforts, therefore, 
retention through reserve affiliation is a key component to a successful Navy 
mission and will be factored into REA computations.
    a.  As detailed in reference (b), Echelon II commands will align their 
recognition programs to support achievement of the FY-21 All- Navy retention 
benchmarks.
    b.  Echelon II commands, type commanders (TYCOM) and immediate superiors 
in command (ISIC) will determine the necessity of waivers where command-level 
performance and personnel complement dictate.

5.  REA.  The annual REA is built upon the tenets in references (c) and (d), 
Brilliant on the Basics.  The annual benchmarks remain the measure to 
determine commands who are brilliant on the basics of retaining the most 
talented Sailors in the Navy and their families.
If commands meet the FY-21 retention and attrition benchmarks, which include 
Reserve affiliation cited in paragraph 4, they are eligible for the REA.
    a.  Computation Exceptions.  A zone with zero transactions at or before 
expiration of active obligated service (EAOS) will qualify as
100 percent reenlistment rate if the command has qualifying transactions in 
the other zones.  Only two zones may be allowed to default to 100 percent.
    b.  Loss transactions on a Sailor transferred from a command due to 
pending separation, medical hold or legal hold will reflect on the command 
the Sailor was last attached to in an accounting code 100 status.
    c.  Commands must have at a minimum one zone of qualifying transactions 
to be eligible for the REA.  Waivers may be considered on a case-by-case 
basis for small commands who have outstanding programs, but no junior 
Sailors.
    d.  Requests for waivers of any award element in paragraph 4 must be 
submitted in writing via the respective ISIC or TYCOM with specific 
justification.  Waiver requests must be signed by the commanding officer.  
Requests not positively endorsed at any level will not be considered.  Waiver 
approval authority resides with Echelon II commands.
    e.  TYCOM and direct reporting counselors will evaluate and submit 
eligible commands to their respective Echelon II commands no later than 1 
December 2021.

6.  REA Announcement and Recognition.  Echelon II commands should announce 
their FY-21 REA recipients following consolidation of Echelon III and direct 
reporting command submissions no later than 31 December 2021.  Following the 
announcement message, awardees may fly the retention excellence pennant or 
paint their anchor gold until release of the following fiscal year award 
message.

7.  Command Information Program Review (CIPR).  The CIPR and how well 
commands score remains a vital part of the Command Career Development Program 
(CDP).  Its effectiveness is measured throughout the career of a Sailor, from 
entry level to transition.  Therefore, conducting a CIPR as a self-assessment 
tool as well as through TYCOM and ISIC inspections remains a strategic 
imperative.  For commands who demonstrate the ability to retain talent, those 
who earn the REA are exempt from a TYCOM and ISIC review, not to exceed 2 
consecutive years.  To ensure no degradation of the CDP, TYCOMs and ISICs 
must conduct spot checks on subordinate commands to include those exempted.  
Echelon II commands with TYCOM input will determine the percentage of CDP 
spot checks.  A key component in running an effective program is the ability 
to access and transmit information.
In line with references (b) and (e), it is vital that the command career 
counselors (CCC) have the highest level of internet access to accomplish 
mission requirements.

8.  Career Counselor of the Year (CCOY).  A key component of brilliant on the 
basics as detailed in references (c) and (d) is recognition.  As a method to 
recognize those Sailors who play a critical role at every level of a Sailors 
career, Echelon II commands have the CCOY program.  This program is open to 
rated Navy Counselors and collateral duty counselors.  Each Echelon II 
command will publish program guidance via separate correspondence.
