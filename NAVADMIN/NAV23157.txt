SUBJ/50TH ANNIVERSARY OF WOMEN IN MILITARY CHAPLAINCY//

RMKS/1.  On 2 July 1973, Rev. Dianna Pohlman was commissioned as a Navy 
Chaplain.  The Navy was the first of all our nation's Armed Forces to open 
military chaplaincy to women.

2.  Over the last fifty years, the women of the Chaplain Corps have 
distinguished themselves in war and peace.  Their devotion to the spiritual 
readiness of Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen, even when facing 
discrimination, represents the best of our nation.

3.  The Chaplain Corps, and our Navy, are stronger and more ready for the 
fight when we represent the incredible diversity of our nation.  Please join 
me in honoring the women of the Chaplain Corps for fifty years of faithful 
service.

4.  Released by Mr. Andrew S. Haeuptle, Director, Navy Staff on behalf of 
Rear Admiral Gregory Todd, Chief of Chaplains.//
