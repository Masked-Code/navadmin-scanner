SUBJ/99TH NAVY RESERVE ANNIVERSARY MESSAGE//

RMKS/1.  ON 3 MARCH, WE CELEBRATE THE 99TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NAVY RESERVE.  
I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS AND THANKS FOR THE DEDICATION, 
SACRIFICE, AND ONGOING SUPPORT PROVIDED BY NAVY RESERVE SAILORS, THEIR 
FAMILIES, AND THEIR EMPLOYERS.

2.  SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THE NAVY RESERVE HAS ANSWERED EVERY CALL.
 FROM CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS TO HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND DISASTER RELIEF, 
THE NAVY RESERVE HAS RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY AND PERFORMED BRILLIANTLY.  SINCE 
2001, OVER 70,000 RESERVE SAILORS HAVE MOBILIZED TO SUPPORT NAVY, MARINE 
CORPS, AND JOINT MISSIONS AROUND THE WORLD.  IN 2013, THE NAVY RESERVE 
DEPLOYED OVER 3,700 INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEES - OVER 90 PERCENT OF THE NAVY'S 
REQUIREMENTS - SO THAT ACTIVE COMPONENT SAILORS COULD FILL CRITICAL AT-SEA 
BILLETS.

3.  OPERATIONALLY, THE NAVY RESERVE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE READY, RELEVANT, OR 
ALIGNED WITH THE NAVY'S ACTIVE COMPONENT.  TODAY, OVER 12,700 RESERVE SAILORS 
ARE PROVIDING GLOBAL, OPERATIONAL SUPPORT TO THE FLEET AND COMBATANT 
COMMANDERS, INCLUDING 4,200 SAILORS CURRENTLY MOBILIZED AND SERVING IN FIVE 
AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY PROVIDING FLEXIBLE, RESPONSIVE, AND INNOVATIVE 
CAPABILITIES.

4.  THE STRENGTH OF THE NAVY RESERVE WILL ALWAYS BE FOUND IN ITS PEOPLE.  THE 
NAVY RESERVE'S DEMONSTRATED CONTRIBUTIONS AND HISTORY OF SERVICE PROVE THEM 
WORTHY OF THEIR MOTTO:  "READY NOW.  ANYTIME, ANYWHERE."  BRAVO ZULU AND 
HAPPY 99TH ANNIVERSARY TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES.

5.  RELEASED BY THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
