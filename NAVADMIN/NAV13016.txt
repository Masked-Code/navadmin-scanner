SUBJ/SUBMISSION OF NAVY AWARDS TO THE OFFICIAL MILITARY PERSONNEL FILE//

REF/A/DOC/SECNAV/22AUG06//
AMPN/REF A IS SECNAVINST 1650.1H, NAVY AND MARINE CORPS AWARDS MANUAL.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES PROCEDURAL CHANGES FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL 
AWARDS FOR ENTRY INTO THE OFFICIAL MILITARY PERSONNEL FILE (OMPF) AT NAVY 
PERSONNEL COMMAND (NPC).  THE NAVY DEPARTMENT AWARDS WEB SERVICES (NDAWS) TOOL 
IS THE AUTHORITATIVE DATA SOURCE FOR PERSONAL AWARDS (NAVY AND MARINE CORPS 
ACHIEVEMENT MEDAL AND HIGHER).  ACTIVITIES IDENTIFIED AS NDAWS COORDINATORS 
HOLD RESPONSIBILITY FOR UPDATING SAILORS' PERSONAL AWARDS WITHIN NDAWS AND 
FORWARDING THE CITATION TO NPC FOR INCLUSION INTO THE SAILOR'S OMPF.

2.  PER REF A, ALL DELEGATED AWARDING AUTHORITIES ARE TO FORWARD COPIES OF THE 
COMPLETED OPNAV FORM 1650/3 AND SIGNED AWARD CITATIONS OR CERTIFICATES TO 
THEIR APPROPRIATE NDAWS COORDINATOR FOR ENTRY INTO NDAWS.  THE NDAWS 
COORDINATOR SHALL SUBMIT THE CITATIONS/CERTIFICATES TO PERS-313 FOR ENTRY INTO 
THE MEMBER'S OMPF WITH RETURN ADDRESS REFLECTING COMPLETE COMMAND MAILING 
ADDRESS.  UPDATES TO THE OMPF WILL ONLY OCCUR AFTER VERIFICATION THAT THE 
AWARD HAS BEEN ENTERED INTO THE NDAWS DATABASE.  A LIST OF NDAWS COORDINATORS 
IS AVAILABLE ON THE NAVY AWARDS WEBSITE AT HTTPS://AWARDS.NAVY.MIL.  AWARDS 
RECEIVED THAT ARE NOT REFLECTED IN NDAWS WILL BE RETURNED TO THE SENDER FOR 
APPROPRIATE ACTION.

3.  AWARD CITATIONS RECEIVED BY NPC FROM SOURCES OTHER THAN NDAWS AUTHORITIES 
WILL BE ENTERED INTO A SAILORS' OMPF IF THE AWARD IS ACCURATELY REFLECTED IN 
NDAWS, INCLUDING PERSONAL AWARDS (NA AND HIGHER) THAT ARE RECEIVED BY NPC AS 
PART OF A SELECTION BOARD PACKAGE.  SAILORS MAILING AWARD 
CERTIFICATES/CITATIONS MUST CHECK NDAWS PRIOR TO SUBMISSION. IF THE AWARD DOES 
NOT REFLECT IN NDAWS, IT WILL NOT BE PLACED INTO THE OMPF.  SAILORS WHO 
REQUIRE AWARD ENTRIES INTO NDAWS WILL NEED TO CONTACT THEIR CURRENT COMMAND'S 
NDAWS COORDINATOR.  THE NDAWS COORDINATOR WILL REQUIRE THE ORIGINAL OR A COPY 
OF THE AWARD CITATION/CERTIFICATE (COPY OF ORDERS FROM SISTER SERVICE/JOINT 
APPROVAL AUTHORITIES, IF AVAILABLE, SHOULD ACCOMPANY CITATION/CERTIFICATE) FOR 
AUTHENTICATING THE AWARD IN ACCORDANCE WITH REF A.   

4.  POINT OF CONTACT:
    A.  NPC POINT OF CONTACT IS THE NPC CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER AT 
CSCMAILBOX(AT)NAVY.MIL OR 1-866-U-ASK-NPC (1-866-827-5672).
    B.  FOR INFORMATION ON AWARDS POLICY AND NDAWS, REFER TO REFERENCE A AND 
THE U.S. NAVY AWARDS WEBSITE AT HTTPS://AWARDS.NAVY.MIL.
