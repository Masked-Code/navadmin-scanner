NARR/REF A IS TIME ON STATION (TOS) AND RETAINABILITY-OBLIGATED SERVICE 
(OBLISERV) MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1306-106.  REF B IS EXTENSION OF 
ENLISTMENTS MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1160-040.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE MODIFICATION OF OBLIGATED SERVICE 
AND EXTENSION POLICIES WHICH WILL MEET OUR OBJECTIVE OF GREATER 
STABILITY AND IMPROVED PREDICTABILITY IN THE FORCE.  IT WILL ALSO 
INCREASE PREDICTABILITY FOR SAILOR DISTRIBUTION AND PROVIDE SAILORS 
WITH THE NEEDED FLEXIBILITY TO MAXIMIZE INCENTIVES AND MANAGE THEIR 
CAREERS.

2.  OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE NUMBER OF SHORT TERM EXTENSIONS HAS 
RISEN SUBSTANTIALLY.  THIS RISE IN THE USE OF SHORT TERM EXTENSIONS 
NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, OPTIMALLY MANNED SHIPS, 
ACCESSION, AND TRAINING PIPELINES.  WE HAVE CONDUCTED AN IN-DEPTH 
REVIEW OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF INCREASED SHORT TERM EXTENSIONS AND 
DETERMINED THAT NAVY POLICIES DRIVE APPROXIMATELY 87% OF THESE 
EXTENSIONS, 70% OF WHICH WERE EXECUTED TO OBTAIN OBLIGATED SERVICE AND 
ADJUST EAOS TO PRD.  ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE ADJUSTED THESE POLICIES TO 
PROVIDE SAILORS THE FLEXIBILITY TO MANAGE THEIR CAREERS AND MAXIMIZE 
ANY MONETARY INCENTIVES WHILE GIVING NAVY A MORE PREDICTABLE PERSONNEL 
DEMAND SIGNAL.

3.  THE FOLLOWING MODIFICATION TO REF A WILL BE EFFECTIVE 1 OCTOBER 
2009:
    A.  MINIMUM OBLIGATED SERVICE REQUIREMENTS FOR SEA DUTY IS CHANGED 
FROM 12 MONTHS TO 24 MONTHS EXCEPT WHERE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AREA 
REQUIREMENTS ARE GREATER.

4. THE FOLLOWING MODIFICATIONS TO REF B WILL BE EFFECTIVE 1 OCTOBER 
2009:
    A.  UNCONDITIONAL EXTENSIONS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED.
    B.  ALL EXTENSIONS COMBINED CAN NOT EXTEND A CONTRACT MORE THAN 24 
MONTHS.
    C.  A MAXIMUM OF TWO EXTENSIONS PER CONTRACT IS AUTHORIZED.
    D.  SAILORS WHO ARE IN A SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS (SRB) 
RATING/NEC WHO ARE NOT WITHIN AN SRB QUALIFYING REENLISTMENT 
ZONE/WINDOW REQUIREMENT AND MUST OBTAIN OBLISERV FOR A PROGRAM/ORDERS, 
AN ADDITIONAL EXTENSION MAY BE EXECUTED WITH PERS-81 APPROVAL.
    E.  PERS-8 AUTHORIZATION IS REQUIRED FOR EXCEPTIONS TO EXTENSION 
POLICY.  EXCEPTION TO POLICY SUBMISSION PROCEDURES AND POINTS OF
