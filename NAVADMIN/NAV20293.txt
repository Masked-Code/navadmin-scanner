RMKS/1.  The annual Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Awards Program recognizes 
the Department of Defense's (DoD) most outstanding field-level and depot-
level military maintenance units from a highly competitive field of 
candidates.  I would like to extend my congratulations and gratitude for all 
Navy units that submitted nomination packages in accordance with references 
(a) and (b).  Each nominee should be proud of their accomplishments.

2.  Reference (c) announced the 2020 SECDEF Maintenance Award winners for the 
entire DoD.  I am pleased to inform you that the following Navy Commands have

ONE (HSM-51), Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan
