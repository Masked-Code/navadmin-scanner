RMKS/1.  Congratulations to selectees of the FY-20 Active-Duty Navy Nuclear 
Limited Duty Officer (LDO) In-Service Procurement Board (ISPB).

2.  All nuclear rates applying for a commission as a Nuclear LDO (designator 
6200) went before a board in November 2018.  All other rates applying for a 
commission as non-nuclear LDO/CWOs will be considered in the LDO/CWO ISPB 
being held in January 2019.  The results of that board will be released via 
separate NAVADMIN.

3.  For LDO, read name, rate, commissioning year/month.  All appointments are 
effective on the first day of the commissioning month.  Members are directed 
to verify their select status via BUPERS Online and the Nuclear LDO detailer 
(PERS-422).

4.  Each applicant should take pride in knowing that the superior performance 
documented in the evaluations reviewed by the board required the members to 
dedicate long hours in making hard choices to ensure only the best and fully 
qualified applicants were selected.  I am confident that the selectees will 
justify their selection time and again in their new careers as mustang 
officers.
Those not selected are highly encouraged to seek out LDO mentorship.
Bravo Zulu to all who were willing to answer the call.

5.  This message is not authority to issue appointments.  Frocking is 
prohibited.  COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806) will deliver appointments to permanent 
ENS under separate correspondence approximately 60 days prior to the 
commissioning date.

6.  Commanding officers are directed to:
    a.  Notify selectee.
    b.  Notify PERS-803 via official correspondence not later than
10 days following release of this message of selectees who do not accept 
appointment.  Selectees who decline their commission within this 10 day 
period will be considered by the FY-20 active-duty enlisted advancement 
boards.  After the 10 day period, PERS-803 will invalidate all FY-20 Active-
Duty Navy Nuclear LDO selectees' eligibility for the FY-20 active-duty 
enlisted advancement boards.
    c.  In line with reference (a), ensure LDO selectees obtain a 
commissioning physical within the 90 days preceding the appointment month.  
Notify the Nuclear LDO detailer (PERS-422) upon completion.
    d.  Hold execution of all permanent change of station orders in abeyance, 
if applicable, and immediately notify PERS-40 of member's selection.
    e.  Administer official physical fitness assessment (PFA) within
4 months of commissioning date.  Selectees must hand carry test results to 
Officer Indoctrination School, Newport, RI.  If selectee fails to achieve 
satisfactory medium, notify the Nuclear LDO detailer (PERS-422).  Hold 
commissioning in abeyance until successful completion of PFA.
    f.  Hold appointment in abeyance if it is determined that a selectee is 
no longer mentally, physically, morally or professionally qualified or if 
they fail to meet current PFA requirements.  Immediately forward 
documentation citing reason to PERS-803.

7.  Nuclear LDO selectees who do not successfully complete a final technical 
interview will maintain their enlisted status and become ineligible to apply 
for Nuclear LDO in the future.  Technical interviews will be scheduled by the 
Nuclear LDO detailer (PERS-422) and selectees will be notified via separate 
correspondence.

8.  If an LDO selectee's enlistment (including any extensions) expires after 
the date of appointment, they are not reenlistment eligible unless 
appointment is declined.

9.  Each selectee should contact the Nuclear LDO detailer (PERS-422) for 
specific requirements with regard to personal information and history cards 
and inform PERS-806 of address changes to facilitate appointment delivery.
