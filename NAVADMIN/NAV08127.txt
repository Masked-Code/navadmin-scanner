NO ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS CAN BE ADDED AFTER THIS DATE.

4.  LESSONS LEARNED.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ADDRESSES LESSONS 
LEARNED FROM THE FY-08 STA-21 SELECTION PROCESS AND BOARD.  THIS 
INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO PRECLUDE COMMON ERRORS.
A.  OF OVER 850 APPLICATIONS RECEIVED, ONLY 713 WERE BOARD ELIGIBLE.  A 
TOTAL OF 210 WERE SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FY-08
STA-21 PROGRAM.
B.  EACH YEAR, PACKAGES ARE STILL NOT CONSIDERED DUE TO NON-QUALIFYING 
SAT/ACT TEST SCORES, NO SAT/ACT TEST SCORES SUBMITTED, NO CO 
ENDORSEMENT, RECENT NJP, AND MISSING OR ILLEGIBLE SUBMISSION OF 
DOCUMENTS.
C.  MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET BEFORE SUBMITTING AN 
APPLICATION.  THE SELECTION PROCESS IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE.  
APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE MAILED ONLY WHEN FULLY COMPLETE.
OFFICER INTERVIEW BOARDS AND THE CO'S PERSONAL INTERVIEW SHOULD ONLY BE 
CONDUCTED AFTER THE APPLICATION IS COMPLETE.  THE FULL PICTURE OF AN 
APPLICANT'S ACADEMIC POTENTIAL CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED BY REVIEWING THE 
SAT/ACT SCORES AND HIGH SCHOOL/COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS.
D.  AN INTERVIEW BOARD AND NOMINATION REVIEW BOARD SHALL BE CONDUCTED 
PER REF A.  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT OFFICERS OF THE APPLICANT'S 
DESIGNATOR CHOICE, IF AVAILABLE AT A BASE OR COMMAND, BE ASKED TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERVIEW/NOMINATION REVIEW BOARD TO ASSESS THE 
APPLICANT FOR THEIR COMMUNITY.  NOMINATION REVIEW BOARDS SHOULD BE 
EXTERNAL OF THE COMMAND.  IN THE EVENT THAT A NOMINATION REVIEW BOARD 
OUTSIDE THE COMMAND CANNOT BE CONVENED, THE COMMAND SHOULD PRESENT 
THREE ADDITIONAL INTERVIEW APPRAISALS TO ADD TO THE PACKAGE OR AN 
EXPLANATION OF WHY THE DIRECTED PROCESS COULD NOT BE FOLLOWED.  HOW 
OTHER OFFICERS VIEW THE APPLICANT CARRIES SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT.  FOR 
JUNIOR SAILORS WITH ONLY SCHOOLHOUSE EVALUATIONS, THE CO MUST ADDRESS 
THIS ISSUE IN HIS OR HER ENDORSEMENT.  SAILORS MUST ADDRESS ANY 
HARDSHIPS OR UNIQUE EXPERIENCES THAT SHAPED THEIR CHARACTER AND JUNIOR 
SAILORS PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCES.  HIGH SCHOOL 
TRANSCRIPTS RARELY PROVIDE IN-DEPTH INFORMATION ON INVOLVEMENT IN 
SPORTS, CLUBS, VOLUNTEER WORK, ETC.
EACH CANDIDATE SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO INCLUDE IN THEIR PERSONAL 
STATEMENT REASON(S) FOR THEIR INTEREST IN THE STA-21 PROGRAM, WHAT THEY 
HAVE DONE TO DESERVE CONSIDERATION FOR THIS PROGRAM, AND WHAT THEY 
WOULD DO WITH THE OPPORTUNITY IF SELECTED.  ADDITIONALLY, APPLICANTS 
SHOULD EXPLAIN ANY MITIGATING ISSUES THE BOARD NEEDS TO CONSIDER (I.E., 
POOR HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE GRADES, UNEXPLAINED GAPS).

5.  DIVERSITY WITHIN THE NAVY'S OFFICER COMMUNITY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR 
FUTURE SUCCESS.  I REQUEST ALL COMMANDING OFFICERS, COMMAND CAREER 
COUNSELORS AND SENIOR ENLISTED MEMBERS ENCOURAGE ALL QUALIFIED SAILORS 
TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM.

6.  APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE MAILED TO:
COMMANDER
NAVAL SERVICE TRAINING COMMAND (OD2/STA-21) 250 DALLAS STREET, STE A 
PENSACOLA, FL 32508-5268

7.  SPECIFIC DETAILS, ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS 
AND SELECTION PROCEDURES CAN BE FOUND IN REF A AND AT THE STA-21 
WEBSITE UNDER PROGRAM OPTIONS AT HTTPS://WWW.STA-21.NAVY.MIL.

CAREER COUNSELORS OR TO NAVAL SERVICE TRAINING COMMAND OFFICER 
DEVELOPMENT DIVISION (OD2) AT (850) 452-9563 OR EMAIL AT
