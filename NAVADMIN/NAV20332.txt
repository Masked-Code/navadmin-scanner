RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the phased roll-out of the Expanded 
Operational Stress Control (E-OSC) Program announced in reference (a).

2.  Background.  In October 2019, reference (a) introduced a new approach to 
the OSC Program called E-OSC, a peer-to-peer, primary prevention program for 
stress mitigation.  The E-OSC Program was developed by the Naval Center for 
Combat and Operational Stress Control in concert with the 21st Century Sailor 
Office (OPNAV N17) and combines the principles of OSC and mind, body and 
resilience training.

3.  Purpose.  Research has shown the need for stress management and 
optimization is more pronounced following deployment as Sailors return home 
and reintegrate into their families and life ashore.
The E-OSC Program is designed to inform and empower Sailors, to identify 
signs of distress and difficulty coping within themselves and others, as well 
as to know where to turn for help.

4.  Approach.  In line with reference (b), the E-OSC Program will leverage 
command resilience teams (CRT) and engaged deckplate leaders to provide more 
accessible, collaborative resources and real-time assessments of unit culture 
to promote healthy command climates and mitigate challenges from common 
stressors like relationships, career transitions, disciplinary or legal 
issues, performance issues and financial strain.  By adopting the principles 
of primary prevention and human factors process, CRTs are empowered to 
monitor, assess and provide recommendations to support and connect Sailors to 
resources to learn and grow from the challenges they face.  This approach 
will give CRTs greater capability and responsibility to assess the overall 
well-being, morale and stress level of the command.

5.  Implementation.  The E-OSC Program will be implemented in two phases.  In 
line with reference (b), the executive officer or second senior officer is 
the chairman of the CRT, tasked with enforcing these requirements.
    a.  Phase one includes the following:
        (1) Effective 1 January 2021, command indoctrination will include a 
video that introduces the stress continuum and core leader functions of the 
E-OSC Program to Sailors.  A link to the video can be found on the Culture of 
Excellence page via MyNavy Portal at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/sailor-
and-family-support under the 21st Century Sailor tab, then Culture of 
Excellence.  This video should also be presented at command safety standdowns 
to ensure that all hands receive this overview of the E-OSC Program.
        (2) Additionally, short (less than 1 minute), informational videos 
that demonstrate the E-OSC Program stress optimization strategies are 
available to commands.  These videos may be used as an introduction to all-
hands training, departmental or divisional training or placed on the social 
media pages or intranet of commands.  A link to the videos can be found on 
the Culture of Excellence page via MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/sailor-and-family-support under the 21st 
Century Sailor tab, then Culture of Excellence.
        (3) In line with reference (b), all CRT members will receive an 
overview of the E-OSC Program in the basic training for primary prevention 
and human factors process online course available at https://erau.edu/navy-
crt-training.  To register for training, members must enter code 8LKE79.  The 
training is available now.
    b.  Phase two includes the following:
        (1) Commanders will be required to designate command E-OSC team 
leaders (TL) (E-7 and above) and assistant team leaders (ATL)
(E-6 and above) who will be required to complete the E-OSC trainer course.  
The E-OSC TL and ATL shall have at least 1 year remaining at the command.  
Navy-wide E-OSC TL and ATL training will be conducted from July through 
December 2021.  Details on this training will be provided via separate 
correspondence no later than May 2021.
Once the E-OSC TL and ATL of a unit have been trained, they can begin 
implementing the E-OSC Program at their command with support from the CRT, 
utilizing references (c) through (e).
        (2) No later than January 2022, commands must have established an 
E-OSC Program.

6.  Additional information and policy requirements will be provided when the 
E-OSC Program is released for Navy-wide implementation in January 2022.  
Reporting requirements will track frequency and effectiveness of the E-OSC 
Program.

7.  Points of contact are CAPT Michael Hall, who can be reached at
(703) 604-1027 or via e-mail at Michael.e.hall5(at)navy.mil or Mr.
Daryl Charles, who can be reached at (901) 874-6926/DSN 882 or via e-mail at 
daryl.charles(at)navy.mil.

8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
