INSTRUCTION.// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES NAVY POLICY
FOR ACCOUNTING FOR NAVY PERSONNEL AFTER A NATURAL OR MAN-MADE
CATASTROPHIC EVENT.  THIS POLICY AND GUIDANCE APPLIES TO ALL NAVY
PERSONNEL IN THE CATEGORIES DEFINED BELOW.  THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM
HAS TAUGHT THE NAVY THAT ITS PERSONNEL MUST STAND EVER READY TO DEPLOY
WORLDWIDE ON SHORT NOTICE IN DEFENSE OF FREEDOM.  WE MUST LEVERAGE FROM
THIS EXPERIENCE TO DEVELOP A CULTURE OF READINESS, BOTH AT SEA AND
ASHORE, TO RESPOND TO ANY DISASTER THAT MAY OCCUR AFFECTING ANY MEMBER
OF THE NAVY FAMILY.  DIFFICULTIES IN ATTAINING A RAPID AND ACCURATE
ACCOUNTING OF THE NAVY FAMILY IDENTIFIED DURING THE 2005 HURRICANE
SEASON AND SUBSEQUENT EXERCISES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND INCORPORATED IN
THIS NAVADMIN.  THIS POLICY IS DESIGNED TO BE DIRECTIVE AS WELL AS
INFORMATIVE.
2.  TASKING:  CNIC IS THE SUPPORTED COMMANDER RESPONSIBLE FOR MUSTERING
PERSONNEL.  COMMANDER, NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (CNPC) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
NAVY PERSONNEL ACCOUNTING AS A SUPPORTING COMMANDER, PROVIDING THE
MUSTER MECHANISM USING THE BOL DISASTER MUSTER TOOL.
WHEN DIRECTED, CNPC WILL FACILITATE AN ACCURATE PERSONNEL ACCOUNTING FOR
MILITARY MEMBERS, THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES FOLLOWING
A NATURAL OR MAN-MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENT.  THIS EFFORT WILL SUPPORT
DEVELOPMENT OF A RESPONSE PLAN TO PROVIDE NEEDED DISASTER RELIEF TO
PERSONNEL AND ASSIST IN RESTORING PERSONNEL AND MISSION READINESS TO
AFFECTED COMMANDS.  ALL ECHELON II COMMANDERS WILL ENSURE FULL
COMPLIANCE OF SUBORDINATE COMMANDS WITH ACCOUNTABILITY PROCEDURES.
3.  NAVY PERSONNEL ACCOUNTABILITY CATEGORIES:
A.  PER REF A, THE NAVY FAMILY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES OF
PERSONNEL:
1.  ACTIVE DUTY PERSONNEL INCLUDING FULL TIME SUPPORT (FTS).
2.  RESERVE PERSONNEL ON ACTIVE DUTY INCLUDING ANNUAL TRAINING, ACTIVE
DUTY FOR TRAINING, ACTIVE DUTY FOR SPECIAL WORK, AND IN A MOBILIZED OR
RECALLED STATUS.
3.  NAVY CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES.
4.  NON-APPROPRIATED FUNDS EMPLOYEES (NAF).
5.  SELECTED RESERVE PERSONNEL (DRILLING RESERVISTS).
6.  FAMILY MEMBERS OF ACTIVE DUTY PERSONNEL INCLUDING FTS (IN DEERS
DATABASE).
7.  FAMILY MEMBERS OF SELECTED RESERVE PERSONNEL (IN DEERS DATABASE).
8.  FAMILY MEMBERS OF NAVY CIVILIANS AND NAF EMPLOYEES WHO ARE RECEIVING
BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH BEING EVACUATED TO AUTHORIZED SAFE HAVEN.
9.  CONTRACTORS AND CONTRACTOR FAMILY MEMBERS ASSIGNED AND LIVING
OVERSEAS.
B.  UNLESS CAPTURED IN ONE OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES, THE FOLLOWING
PERSONNEL COHORTS HAVE NO PERSONNEL ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN
THIS GUIDANCE:
1.  NAVY RETIREES AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.
2.  DEFENSE CONTRACTORS SUPPORTING THE NAVY (EXCEPT THOSE OCONUS).
3.  MEMBERS OF THE INDIVIDUAL READY RESERVE AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.
4.  ACCOUNTABILITY DEFINITIONS:
A.  COMMAND MUSTER:  LOCALLY COMPLETED MUSTER OF ALL PERSONNEL ASSIGNED
IN EACH CATEGORY ABOVE.
B.  COMMAND ACCOUNTABILITY:  A BY NAME AND SSN ACCOUNTING IN THE BOL
DISASTER MUSTER TOOL OF ALL PERSONNEL ASSIGNED TO THE COMMAND IN EACH
CATEGORY ABOVE WITH AMPLIFYING INFORMATION TO INCLUDE STATUS OF THE
PERSONNEL.
C.  TOTAL ASSIGNED:  TOTAL PERSONNEL ASSIGNED TO THE COMMAND IN EACH
CATEGORY ABOVE.  INCLUDE IN THIS COMPUTATION PERSONNEL WHO ARE
"ACCOUNTED FOR", "UNREPORTED" AND "KNOWN UNACCOUNTED FOR".
D.  ACCOUNTED FOR: PERSONNEL THE COMMAND HAS CONTACTED AND MUSTERED OR
IS KNOWN DECEASED.
E.  UNREPORTED: NO REPORT HAS BEEN RECEIVED FOR THE COMMAND.
F.  KNOWN UNACCOUNTED FOR: PERSONNEL WHO REMAIN "UNACCOUNTED FOR"
AFTER THE INITIAL COMMAND MUSTER.
G.  EVACUATED: PERSONNEL WITH WHOM THE COMMAND HAS POSITIVE CONTACT BUT
HAVE RELOCATED TO AN AREA AWAY FROM THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF INTEREST
(GAOI) OR THEIR PERMANENT DUTY STATION. COMMANDS MUST PROVIDE LOCATION
AND UPDATED CONTACT INFORMATION IN THE BOL DISASTER MUSTER TOOL FOR
PERSONNEL IN THIS CATEGORY.
H.  DECEASED:  PERSONNEL WHO ARE CONFIRMED DECEASED.  PERSONNEL IN THIS
CATEGORY ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN A DECEASED STATUS.  REPORTING A MEMBER AS
DECEASED IN THE BOL DISASTER MUSTER TOOL DOES NOT REPLACE OR SUBSTITUTE
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTS (E.G., PERSONNEL CASUALTY REPORT).
5.  CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS (CONOPS):  THE FOLLOWING CONOPS PROVIDES
POLICY FOR SCENARIOS RANGING FROM DISASTERS THAT OCCUR WITHOUT WARNING
("NO NOTICE" EVENTS) TO DISASTERS WITH ADVANCE WARNING AND PREPARATION
LEAD TIME.  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT COMMANDS PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO
NORMAL AND STANDARD NAVY PERSONNEL TRANSACTIONS (E.G., RAPID DIARY
GAINS/LOSSES, ACCURATE CIVILIAN PERSONNEL STATUS, ETC.), BECAUSE THE
DATA USED BY CNPC TO POPULATE THE BOL DISASTER MUSTER TOOL PERSONNEL
DATABASE WILL ONLY REFLECT THE ACCURACY OF THE DATA MAINTAINED IN
MULTIPLE NAVY DATABASES BY THESE PROCESSES.  IT IS INCUMBENT UPON
COMMANDERS, COMMANDING OFFICERS, AND OFFICERS IN CHARGE TO PREPARE EARLY
AND NOT RELY ON ANTICIPATED PRIOR WARNING.  AS THERE WILL BE "NO NOTICE"
EVENTS AND CONDITIONS OF AN IMPENDING DISASTER CAN CHANGE RADICALLY
DESPITE ADVANCE WARNING, OPERATIONAL EXECUTION MAY INCLUDE SOME OR ALL
OF THE FOLLOWING FOUR PHASES:
A.  PREPARATORY PHASE.  COMMAND PREPARATION TO RESPOND TO DISASTERS MUST
BE ONGOING, AND MUST BEGIN UPON RECEIPT OF THIS NAVADMIN.
ACTIONS TAKEN BY COMMANDS DURING THE PREPARATORY PHASE PLACE NAVY
LEADERSHIP AT ALL LEVELS IN THE BEST POSITION TO TRAIN PERSONNEL AND TO
EXECUTE PROCEDURES TO SUPPORT EVACUATION AND RECONSTITUTION IN THE EVENT
OF A DISASTER.  REPORT STATUS OF PREPARATORY PHASE TWO WEEKS AFTER
RECEIPT TO THE INSTALLATION COMMANDING OFFICER OR REGIONAL COMMANDER PER
CNICINST 3440.17 APPENDIX U SECTION AVAILABLE AT WWW.CNI.NAVY.MIL.  AS
YOU PREPARE COMMAND PLANS, A BASELINE ASSUMPTION IN YOUR PLANNING IS
OPERATING IN AN ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT RELIABLE PHONE OR INTERNET
COMMUNICATIONS.  REQUIRED ACTIONS TO BE COMPLETED DURING THIS PHASE
INCLUDE:
1.  COMMAND ACCESS FOR THE BOL DISASTER MUSTER TOOL IS GRANTED BASED ON
ITEMPO ADMINISTRATIVE OR VIEWING RIGHTS.  AS A RESULT, IT IS IMPERATIVE
THAT COMMANDING OFFICERS (CO), EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (XO) AND THEIR
DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVES REGULARLY VERIFY AND UPDATE THESE RIGHTS IN
ITEMPO.
2.  DEVELOP A LOCALLY GENERATED COMMAND PERSONNEL ROSTER INCLUDING NAMES
AND EMERGENCY CONTACT INFORMATION (LOCATION, PHONE, EMAIL) FOR EVERY
PERSON ASSIGNED IN ALL CATEGORIES IDENTIFIED IN PARA 3.
3.  ESTABLISH ALTERNATE COMMAND SITES (INCLUDING PRIMARY AND SECONDARY
EMAIL AND PHONE CONTACT INFORMATION).
4.  ESTABLISH PROJECTED SAFE HAVEN LOCATIONS CONSISTENT WITH REGIONAL
COMMANDER GUIDANCE.
5.  DEVELOP DETAILED COMMAND AND REGIONAL EVACUATION PLANS.
6.  DEVELOP AND EXERCISE COMMAND CRISIS ACTION PROCEDURES.
7.  REVIEW THE ROLE OF THE COMMAND OMBUDSMAN IN DISASTER PREPARATION,
RESPONSE AND ACCOUNTING (CONSIDER UNACCOMPANIED FAMILY MEMBERS OF
INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEES AND OTHER DEPLOYED AND TAD PERSONNEL).
8.  ESTABLISH COMMAND AND REGIONAL DISASTER TRAINING PROGRAMS.
B.  EVACUATION PHASE.  WHEN DIRECTED, FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF CREDIBLE
INFORMATION AND WARNING, PERSONNEL ASSIGNED WITHIN IDENTIFIED AREAS
AFFECTED BY A DISASTER WILL MOVE TO DESIGNATED ALTERNATE COMMAND SITES
AND/OR SAFE HAVEN LOCATIONS.  ACTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED IN PREPARATION
FOR THIS PHASE INCLUDE:
1.  DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY PLANS TO SUPPORT
EVACUATED PERSONNEL AND FAMILIES (FUEL, FOOD, WATER, SHELTER, CLOTHING,
TRANSPORTATION, ETC.) 2.  DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
AND REPORT TEMPLATES FOR USE WHILE EVACUATED (INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TO
YOUR COMMAND).
3.  COMMAND OPERATIONAL READINESS AND CAPABILITY WHILE EVACUATED.
4.  SPECIFIC POLICIES/ACTIONS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT PERSONNEL EVACUATING
THE GAOI WILL BE PROVIDED BY SEPARATE CORRESPONDENCE.
C.  RECOVERY PHASE.  PERSONNEL AFFECTED BY A DISASTER AND ORDERED TO
EVACUATE WILL, WHEN DIRECTED, RETURN TO THEIR PERMANENT DUTY STATION.
INITIALLY, PERSONNEL RETURNING WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THEIR COMMAND.
SUBSEQUENTLY, THE COMMAND MUSTER INFORMATION WILL BE ENTERED IN THE BOL
DISASTER MUSTER TOOL.  ACTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED IN PREPARATION FOR THE
RECOVERY PHASE INCLUDE:
1.  DEVELOPMENT OF LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY PLANS TO SUPPORT RETURN OF KEY
AND ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL TO THE PERMANENT DUTY STATION.
2.  DEVELOPMENT OF NOTIONAL PHASED RETURN PLAN FOR REMAINING PERSONNEL
AND FAMILY MEMBERS.
D.  RECONSTITUTION PHASE.  WHILE PERSONNEL ARE BEING ACCOUNTED FOR IN
THE BOL DISASTER MUSTER TOOL, COMMANDS WILL ALSO COMPLETE AN INITIAL
"COMMAND STATUS ASSESSMENT."  RESULTS OF THE INITIAL STATUS ASSESSMENTS
WILL PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR IMPLEMENTING COHESIVE RECONSTITUTION
STRATEGIES, PER REF B, LED BY CNIC.  WHEN CNIC DETERMINES THAT THE
EXTENT OF DAMAGE AND EVACUATION REQUIRES INDIVIDUAL ASSISTANCE, AFFECTED
PERSONNEL AND/OR FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE ASKED TO ASSESS THEIR INDIVIDUAL
NEEDS VIA AN ON-LINE ASSESSMENT SURVEY OR BY CONTACTING THE CNPC
EMERGENCY CALL CENTER (1-877-414-5358).  THE PURPOSE OF THIS ASSESSMENT
IS TO IDENTIFY THE TYPE AND EXTENT OF SUPPORT NEEDED AND TO PROVIDE
APPROPRIATE ASSISTANCE TO AFFECTED NAVY PERSONNEL AND FAMILIES.  NAVY
FAMILY MEMBERS WHO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL NEEDS (I.E., MEDICAL, HOUSING,
TRANSPORTATION, ETC.) STEMMING FROM A CATASTROPHIC EVENT WILL THEN BE
CONTACTED BY A CASE MANAGER OR A SUBJECT-MATTER EXPERT WHO CAN ASSIST
WITH SPECIFIC ISSUES.  ACTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED IN PREPARATION FOR THE
RECONSTITUTION PHASE INCLUDE:
1.  DEVELOPMENT OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TEMPLATES AFTER RETURNING TO
PERMANENT DUTY STATION.
2.  DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMAND LOGISTICS PLANS TO SUPPORT
INITIAL RESTORATION OF OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES.

PERMANENT DUTY STATION WHILE COMMAND IS DEPLOYED) AND ALL FAMILY MEMBERS
OF DEPLOYED UNITS THAT ARE ASSIGNED WITHIN THE GAOI.
COMMAND IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR IN COMMAND (ISIC) SHALL ASSIST IN COMPLETING
THIS MEASURE.
3.  ACCOUNT FOR MILITARY FAMILY MEMBERS (ACTIVE DUTY AND SELECTED
