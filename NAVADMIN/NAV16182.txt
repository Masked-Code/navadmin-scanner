NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 371/08, OFFICER O-5 AND O-6 TIME-IN-GRADE (TIG) 
WAIVERS.  REF B IS OPNAVINST 1811.3A, VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT AND TRANSFER TO 
THE FLEET RESERVE OF MEMBERS OF THE NAVY SERVING ON ACTIVE DUTY.//

RMKS/1.  Effective immediately, reference (a) is cancelled. Reference (a) 
previously authorized all officers in the grades of O-5 and O-6 to request a 
waiver to reduce their time-in-grade (TIG) requirement, as reference (b) 
requires officers to satisfy the minimum active duty TIG requirement to 
retire in the highest grade satisfactorily served.  This NAVADMIN announces 
an update to the blanket TIG waiver authorizations by providing community-
specific direction via the website listed below for those communities 
supporting TIG and next-lower-grade (NLG) waivers.  This NAVADMIN also 
provides guidance for when an officer should include a NLG waiver request in 
his or her initial application.

2.  A consolidated listing of officer communities accepting TIG and NLG 
waivers can be found at:  http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/communitymanagers/pages/officer-retirement-waivers.aspx. However, 
hardship or special circumstance cases may be considered for all communities 
on a case-by-case basis.

3.  For applicants who do not meet the applicable TIG requirement, Commander, 
Navy Personnel Command may authorize a member to be retired in the NLG for 
which the member served on active duty satisfactorily in accordance with 
reference (b).  Officers desiring to retire with an NLG waiver if their TIG 
waiver request is denied should include a contingent NLG waiver request in 
their original TIG application.  In any case, officers should expect to meet 
service obligations until a TIG or NLG waiver is approved.

4.  Active component (AC) O-5s and O-6s will continue to request retirement 
and TIG/NLG waivers through Officer Retirements (PERS-835).  Reserve 
component (RC) O-5s and O-6s will continue to request retirement and TIG/NLG 
waivers through Reserve Personnel Administration (PERS-91B).  Approval 
recommendations shall be based on individual community requirements; final 
approval authority rests with Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower 
and Reserve Affairs.

5.  Points of contact (for procedural and policy questions):
    a.  AC commander and captain retirement procedures, Branch Head Officer 
Retirements, PERS-835, at (901) 874-3180/3183/DSN 882, or email to 
pers_835_retirements(at)navy.mil.
    b.  RC commander and captain retirement procedures and TIG policy 
questions, PERS-91B, at (901) 874-4371/4713/DSN 882.

6.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
