RMKS/1.  The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) announces the winners of the 
2020 CNO Naval History Essay Contest.

2.  CNO Gilday announced the annual CNO Essay Contest in reference (a) and 
requested submitted essays apply lessons of naval history to the effective 
establishment and maintenance of maritime superiority in an era of great 
power competition.  As CNO Gilday noted, examining how the Navy grappled with 
challenges in the past shortens our learning cycle and keeps us ahead of 
todays competitors.
    a.  Due to the exceptional quality of the essays, judging was 
challenging.  Entrants from across the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast 
Guard submitted 113 essays: 12 in the Professional Historian category and 101 
in the Rising Historian category.
    b.  Congratulations to the winners and BZ to all the entrants as the 
overall quality of essays and creativity displayed in the contest this year 
was remarkable.
