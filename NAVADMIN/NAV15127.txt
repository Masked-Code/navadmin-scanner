RMKS/1.  Before announcing Navy nominees for the 2015 SECDEF Maintenance 
Awards, I want to personally thank the numerous commands who took the time to 
recognize their unit contributions. Your continued participation ensures that 
the best maintenance units are recognized for the remarkable efforts and 
support they provide to our warfighters.  It was an honor to review such a 
large and competitive field of deserving units, and a pleasure to announce 
Navy's nominees to SECDEF.

2.  Annually, six field-level maintenance units will be awarded the SECDEF 
Field-Level Maintenance Awards, two from each competitive category (small, 
medium and large).  From these six winning units, one will be selected as the 
*best of the best* and named the annual SECDEF Phoenix Award winner.  Navy 
nominees for the field-level (Phoenix) competition are:

A.  Small Commands:
HELICOPTER SEA COMBAT SQUADRON FIFTEEN (HSC 15)
USS ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG 51)
B.  Medium Commands:
USS GETTYSBURG (CG 64)
USS FRANK CABLE (AS 40)
C.  Large Commands:
USS GEORGE WASHINGTON (CVN 73)
TRIDENT REFIT FACILITY, KINGS BAY, GEORGIA

3.  Annually, one program from an organic depot-level maintenance activity 
will be awarded the Robert T. Mason Award for Depot Maintenance Excellence. 
Navy nominees for the depot-level competition are:
A.  PUGET SOUND NAVAL SHIP YARD (SHAFTING AND RUDDER TEAM)
B.  FLEET READINESS CENTER SOUTHEAST (VERTICAL LIFT INTEGRATED PRODUCT TEAM)

4.  SECDEF selection boards will evaluate similar input from all Services and 
announce six field-level winners (two per category), and one depot-level 
winner.  All SECDEF maintenance award recipients will be recognized by the 
Office of the Secretary of Defense at a formal awards ceremony to be 
announced under separate correspondence.

5.  The outstanding initiative, imagination, and professionalism demonstrated 
by all participants are a reflection of Navy-wide efforts to War Fighting 
First, Operate Forward, and be Ready.  Congratulations to all nominees.
