SUBJ/ACTIVE DUTY HEALTH OF THE FORCE SURVEY// 
 
RMKS/1.  Summary:  Request all Active Duty personnel participate in 
Navy’s Health of the Force survey.  This voluntary and confidential 
survey will remain open through 31 August 2022, takes at most 20 
minutes to complete and can be accessed at:  
https://usnavy.gov1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0qarNdLTkn8MkxU. 
Command triads should take the survey themselves and emphasize its 
value within their commands. 
 
2.  As part of the Chief of Naval Operations, 11 January 22, call to 
action for our Navy to Get Real and Get Better, it is important that 
our Navy *Get Real* by developing a precise, sustained view of the 
well-being of our force.  The Health of Force survey is designed to 
provide a confidential means to develop this view so that our Navy 
can *Get Better*, adjusting programs and policies to better meet the 
needs of our Sailors and their families. 
 
3.  In logging into the survey, participants will be asked for their 
Department of Defense Identification (DOD ID) number.  This helps 
limit participation to the Active Duty population and eliminates the 
need to ask demographic questions.  The DOD ID number will not be 
used to link answers to a particular respondent and absolute 
confidentiality will be maintained. 
 
4.  The greater the participation, the greater the accuracy of the 
results.  This year’s survey builds on core metrics relating to work 
environment and well-being by addressing such issues as retention 
plans and influencers, work/life balance, family planning, pregnancy 
programs, parenting in the Navy and access to medical care.  Survey 
results will be debriefed in early 2023. 
 
5.  The survey can be accessed using the following link:

If you have questions about the survey, please contact the Navy 
Survey Office, OPNAV N176, Dr. Jen Jebo, she may be reached at
