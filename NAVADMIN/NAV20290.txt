RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the guidance for the administration of the 
January 2021 (cycle 250) E-7 Navy-wide advancement examination (NWAE) for 
Active-Duty (AD) and Full-Time Support (FTS) Sailors.  As a continued safety 
measure during the COVID-19 outbreak, exams will be administered utilizing a 
testing window from 18-29 January 2021.  This testing window will allow for 
smaller groups of test takers to ensure adequate social distancing can be 
maintained between testers at testing facilities, while maintaining the high 
standards and continued culture of learning that drive our enlisted 
advancement system.  Canvasser Recruiter (CANREC) personnel with a branch 
class of 32 and a special program indicator code of *W* (enlisted CANREC) 
will no longer take Active-Duty exams.
Commencing with the February 2021 (cycle 108) E-7 Selected Reserve
(SELRES) exams, CANREC E-6 personnel are authorized to take the SELRES exam 
for Limited Duty Officer (LDO) purposes.  The administration of the exam 
across a window and shifting CANREC Sailors to take the SELRES exam are both 
changes to reference (a).
Information pertaining to selection board criteria will be promulgated in a 
future NAVADMIN.
