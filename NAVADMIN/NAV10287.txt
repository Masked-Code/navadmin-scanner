NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 343/08, UNIFORM UPDATE.  REF B IS NAVY UNIFORM 
UPDATE.
REF C IS US NAVY UNIFORM REGULATIONS.

RMKS/1.  THE NAVY WORKING UNIFORM (NWU) FACILITATES NAVY LEADERSHIP'S 
INTENT TO STANDARDIZE THE PROFESSIONAL APPEARANCE OF SAILORS WHEN 
WEARING A WORKING UNIFORM ASHORE.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES UPDATED 
GUIDANCE ON THE MANDATORY WEAR DATES OF THE NWU, AS ANNOUNCED IN REF A.  
FLEET-WIDE AVAILABILITY OF THE  NWU HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVED SIX 
MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THE ORIGINALLY  ESTABLISHED MANDATORY WEAR DATE, 
AND THE NWU WILL NOW BE WORN AS THE WORKING UNIFORM ASHORE BY 31 
DECEMBER 2010.

2.  CURRENT NWU COMPONENT INVENTORY INDICATES THAT SAILORS HAVE 
PURCHASED AN AVERAGE OF 1.3 UNIFORMS, WELL BELOW THE FOUR UNIFORMS PER 
SEA BAG WHICH MOST SAILORS HAVE BEEN PAID TO PROCURE.  SEABAG CONTENT 
AND QUANTITY REQUIREMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED TO ENSURE DEPLOYMENT AND 
MISSION READINESS.

3.  THOSE SAILORS THAT COMPLETED RECRUIT TRAINING DURING FISCAL YEAR 
2008, AND PRIOR TO 27 APRIL 2009, RECEIVED A REDUCED CLOTHING 
REPLACEMENT ALLOWANCE (CRA) AMOUNT DUE TO DOD FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
REGULATION (DODFMR) GUIDELINES THAT LIMIT THE PERCENTAGE OF CRA 
ENTITLEMENT BASED ON TIME OF ACTIVE SERVICE.  THESE SAILORS WILL BE 
REQUIRED TO MEET THE FOUR UNIFORM STANDARD BY 31 DECEMBER 2012.

4.  OTHER THAN THIS GROUP, ALL OTHER SAILORS HAVE RECEIVED ALLOWANCES 
FOR THE FOUR SETS OF UNIFORMS.  SAILORS WHO COMPLETED RECRUIT TRAINING 
ON AND AFTER 27 APRIL 2009 WERE ISSUED A COMPLETE COMPLEMENT OF 
REQUIRED NWU COMPONENTS, AND ARE REQUIRED TO MEET THE FOUR UNIFORM 
STANDARD BY 31 DECEMBER 2010.

5.  PREVIOUSLY, WE PROVIDED GUIDANCE TO OUR SAILORS TO SAVE THESE 
ANNUAL UNIFORM ALLOWANCE INCREASES FOR THE PURCHASE OF NWU SEABAG 
REQUIREMENTS, IN ORDER TO AVOID ADVERSE IMPACT ON PERSONAL FINANCES AS 
THE MANDATORY WEAR DATE APPROACHES.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT LEADERSHIP CONTINUE TO EDUCATE OUR SAILORS TO 
COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF PROCURING NWU ITEMS WITH THE FUNDS THEY 
HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED.

6.  BY 31 DECEMBER 2010, COMMANDERS AND COMMANDING OFFICERS SHOULD HAVE 
VERIFIED THAT ALL SAILORS UNDER THEIR COMMAND HAVE THE REQUIRED UNIFORM 
COMPONENTS IN THEIR SEA BAG, APPROPRIATE TO THE LEVEL OF UNIFORM 
ALLOWANCE THAT EACH SAILOR HAS RECEIVED.  ACTIVE DUTY ENLISTED THAT 
ENTERED AND COMPLETED RECRUIT TRAINING DURING FISCAL YEAR 2008, AND 
PRIOR TO 27 APRIL 2009, SHOULD HAVE TWO COMPLETE SETS OF THE NWU.  
ANNUAL CRA FOR THESE SAILORS WILL PROVIDE FOR REPLACEMENT OF ONE SET OF 
NWUS PER YEAR AND PROCUREMENT OF NWU FOOTWEAR AND OUTERWEAR BASED ON 
THEIR APPLICABLE WEAR LIFE, ALLOWING THEM TO HAVE FOUR COMPLETE SETS BY 
31 DECEMBER 2012.  FOR ALL OTHER SAILORS, FULL NWU COMPONENT 
REQUIREMENTS ARE AS
FOLLOWS:
    A.  FOUR NWU BLOUSES AND TROUSERS
    B.  ONE PAIR OF NWU BOOTS
    C.  TWO-EIGHT POINT UTILITY CAPS
    D.  FIVE 100% BLUE COTTON T-SHIRTS
    E.  FIVE PAIRS OF BOOT SOCKS
    F.  ONE MOCK TURTLE NECK SWEATER
    G.  ONE FLEECE LINER
    H.  ONE GORTEX PARKA

7.  NWU COMPONENTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE VIA NAVY EXCHANGE UNIFORM 
CENTERS.
NAVY EXCHANGE UNIFORM SALES ASSOCIATES ARE AVAILABLE TO ENSURE PROPER 
FIT AND SIZING OF NWU COMPONENTS.

8.  REF C ESTABLISHES UNIFORM QUANTITY REQUIREMENTS FOR SAILORS IN 
PAYGRADE E1-E9.  E7-E9 HAVE RECEIVED THE 2008/2009 UNIFORM ALLOWANCE 
INCREASE TO SUPPORT PURCHASING OF THE ITEMS LISTED IN PARA 5 ABOVE.  
PER ARTICLE 3101.1 OFFICERS AND CHIEF PETTY OFFICERS ARE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR BUYING AND MAINTAINING UNIFORMS APPROPRIATE TO THEIR ASSIGNED 
DUTIES AND AS REQUIRED BY THEIR PRESCRIBING AUTHORITY.
THERE IS NO MINIMUM NUMBER OF UNIFORMS REQUIRED TO BE IN THEIR 
POSSESSION.
SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF UNIFORM ITEMS SHALL BE PROCURED AND MAINTAINED 
TO ENSURE HIGH STANDARDS OF PERSONAL HYGIENE AND APPEARANCE.

9.  THE NWU OCCASION FOR WEAR, AS DETAILED IN REF B, REMAINS IN EFFECT.

10.  YOUR LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT IN THIS EFFORT IS GREATLY APPRECIATED 
TO ENSURE UNIFORM STANDARDIZATION, MISSION READINESS, AND REDUCTION OF 
EXCESS INVENTORY WHICH COULD IMPEDE FUTURE UNIFORM INITIATIVES.
