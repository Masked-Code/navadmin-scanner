RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN IS THE THIRD IN A SERIES DESIGNED TO PROVIDE 
INFORMATION ON SUPPORT SERVICES, ASSISTANCE AND ENTITLEMENTS THAT ARE 
AVAILABLE TO NAVY FAMILIES.  THIS MONTH WE ARE FOCUSING ON SOME VERY 
SPECIAL PEOPLE:  MILITARY CHILDREN.

2.  BACKGROUND.  IN 1986, APRIL WAS DESIGNATED THE MONTH OF THE 
MILITARY CHILD BY FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY CASPER WEINBERGER.
THE MONTH-LONG OBSERVANCE WAS SET ASIDE AS A TIME TO APPLAUD MILITARY 
FAMILIES AND THEIR CHILDREN FOR THE SACRIFICES THEY MAKE AND OBSTACLES 
THEY OVERCOME, SUCH AS FREQUENT MOVES, SCHOOL CHANGES AND SEPARATION 
FROM A DEPLOYED PARENT.  THE MONTH OF THE MILITARY CHILD IS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO PAY TRIBUTE TO MILITARY CHILDREN FOR THEIR COMMITMENT, 
STRUGGLES AND UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT OF OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM.  
WHEN PARENTS SERVE IN THE MILITARY, THEIR CHILDREN SERVE TOO.

3.  NAVY CHILD AND YOUTH PROGRAMS (CYP).  CYP PROVIDE CHILDREN AND 
FAMILIES WITH TRUSTED PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ASSIST IN COPING WITH 
CHALLENGES MILITARY FAMILIES FACE, MAKING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRESS
