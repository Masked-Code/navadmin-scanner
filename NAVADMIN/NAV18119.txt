RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces revised Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) 
award levels and reenlistment policy for Active Component (AC) and Full-Time 
Support (FTS), and supersedes reference (a).  This NAVADMIN expands the SRB 
program by adding 39 skills in 12 ratings and increases award levels for 135 
skills in 48 ratings, and announces a rolling eligibility window to reenlist 
for SRB. Changes to Navy Enlisted Classifications (NEC) as a result of the 
new NEC construct are reflected throughout this NAVADMIN.  As a reference, 
both legacy and new NECs are listed below to show SRB eligible 
ratings/skills.  Legacy NECs are annotated in this NAVADMIN as LNEC and new 
NECs are annotated as NNEC.  Commands should check the NPC website listed in 
paragraph 3 for updates as new NECs are released.

2.  Increased award levels are effective immediately and decreased levels are 
effective 30 days after the release of this NAVADMIN.

3.  Reenlistment requests for the following SRB award levels will be approved 
based on quota availability.  SRB reenlistment requests for FTS are currently 
not being accepted.  SRB reenlistment requests for AC must be submitted to 
Community Management Support Branch (BUPERS-328) via Officer Personnel 
Information System (OPINS) or Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System 
(NSIPS) 35 to 120 days in advance of the requested reenlistment date for the 
Sailor.  Eligible Sailors desiring SRB reenlistment are encouraged to work 
with their chain of command as early as possible within their reenlistment 
window to maximize potential for SRB.  BUPERS-328 maintains the current list 
of SRB eligible ratings/skills based on available quotas at the following 
website: http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/pages/srb.aspx.  Addendums to the current 
award message posted on this site provide notification of skill closures and 
supersede the current NAVADMIN.  For those commands with limited internet 
access, command career counselors (CCC) should contact BUPERS-328 directly 
for the latest updates.

4.  AC SRB award levels are as follows (Note:  a * indicates a level located 
in other sections of paragraph 4, a - indicates a reduction from previous 
award level, a + indicates an increase from previous award level):

    b.  Notes
        (1) NEC 0000, commonly referred to as quad zero, is listed here to 
establish that Sailors in these ratings/career fields can hold any or no NEC 
and still be qualified for the SRB provided they meet all other applicable 
non-NEC related criteria.
        (2) Subsurface or surface designation does not mean an individual 
must be subsurface or enlisted surface warfare specialist qualified, but it 
indicates the component of the rating in which they can reasonably be 
expected to serve.  Training, qualifications, and previous or projected duty 
assignments at sea will indicate the appropriate rating component.  When 
using the force management system and the OPINS to input a SRB 
precertification request, use the rating (with appropriate suffix 
designation/NEC) as specified in this NAVADMIN.  For example, a surface 
electronics technician with no NEC would submit 'ET(SW)' on precertification 
for rating.
        (3) An SRB approval for all CT, IS, IT, and ITS ratings will be 
contingent upon the Sailor having a current single scope background 
investigation (SSBI) or Tier 5 investigation, an active SSBI/Tier 5 or recent 
submission of a SSBI/Tier 5 package.  Commands must verify the Sailor has a 
current SSBI/Tier 5, active SSBI/Tier 5, or has submitted a SSBI/Tier 5 
package and make note of this in the comments section of the precertification 
request.
        (4) E-3 to E-6 Sailors only.  Sailors selected for E-7 advancement 
are not eligible for SRB.
        (5) X is used as a placeholder to identify where multiple LNECs 
within a rating are eligible for a stated award level.
Sailors in the specified rating that hold an LNEC that includes the numbers 
preceding X or XX are eligible for SRB.  For example, SO 539XA includes SO 
5391 and SO 5392 or 14XX includes all subsurface electronics technician 
navigation LNECs beginning with 14.
        (6) Letters appearing with an LNEC are only for administrative use.
        (7) Reenlistment bonuses for nuclear-trained Sailors:
            (a) Reenlistment compensation for zones 1 through 3 nuclear-
trained Sailors holding a nuclear supervisor NEC shall be provided under the 
Enlisted Supervisor Retention Pay (ESRP) Program in line with policies and 
procedures detailed in reference (b) along with current ESRP multiples.
            (b) SRB entitlement for eligible nuclear-trained Sailors who 
reenlist after applying for an officer program will be held pending selection 
results.  For nuclear-trained Sailors only, the date on which conditional 
release is approved by Nuclear Propulsion Program Manager (OPNAV N133) as 
directed in reference (c) is considered the date of the application to an 
officer program with the exception of STA-21(N) and Limited Duty Officer 
(LDO).  For STA-21(N) and LDO, the application deadline is considered the 
suspense date.
        (8) E-4 to E-6 Sailors only.  Sailors selected for E-7 advancement 
are not eligible for SRB.
        (9) E-3 to E-5 Sailors only.  Sailors selected for E-6 advancement 
are not eligible for SRB.
        (10) FC AEGIS 0000 SRB eligibility contingent upon graduation of an 
FCA NEC awarding "C" School.
        (11) Sailors holding a CTI NEC must be differentiated by Enlisted 
Manning Code (EMC).  Only Sailors having one of the following NECs and 
assigned in the respective EMC are eligible for SRB:

            (a) LNEC(NNEC):  9SPA, EMC:  B515
            (b) LNEC(NNEC):  9520(813A)/9RUS, EMC:  B516
            (c) LNEC(NNEC):  9ARB/9PES, EMC:  B511
            (d) LNEC(NNEC):  9CMN/9KOR EMC:  B512

5.  Sailors must reenlist within 180 days of their EAOS, except in the 
following cases:
    a.  Nuclear-trained Sailors.
    b.  Sailors eligible for combat zone tax exclusion (CZTE) are authorized 
to reenlist anytime within 1 calendar year of their EAOS.  These Sailors, 
along with CCC must annotate in the remarks section of the precertification 
request whether they are currently CZTE eligible or serving in a qualified 
hazardous duty area.  A condition of approval of their precertification 
request is that the reenlistment of the Sailor occurs in a month during which 
CZTE qualification applies.
    c.  Sailors who received an Early Promote in block 45 of their most 
recent regular periodic evaluation will be allowed to reenlist early any time 
within one calendar year of their EAOS.  No transfer, concurrent, or special 
evaluations will apply.  Sailors advanced within the 12 months prior to their 
EAOS will be allowed to substitute the last regular periodic evaluation in 
their previous pay grade.  Personnel must e-mail a signed copy of the 
evaluation to BUPERS-328 once their precertification has been submitted.  
This requirement is only for those that fall under the provisions of this 
paragraph.
    d.  Sailors who must OBLISERV to execute a permanent change of station 
(PCS) move will be allowed to reenlist early any time within one calendar 
year of the detachment month, but not later than the date of detachment from 
the last intermediate duty station.

6.  SRB Submission Requirements
    a.  Commands are required to submit SRB reenlistment requests to
BUPERS-328 via OPINS or NSIPS 35 to 120 days in advance of the requested 
reenlistment date of the Sailor.  Requests submitted less than 35 days prior 
to the requested reenlistment date will be rejected.  However, commands may 
contact BUPERS-328 for waiver eligibility and procedures.  Sailors must have 
an approved SRB request before reenlisting.  The servicing personnel office 
is responsible for verifying the reenlistment, posting the contract, 
releasing the first payment, and verifying the master military pay account.  
Commands shall immediately notify OPNAV N130 when a Sailor fails to maintain 
eligibility in the skill for which SRB was paid (e.g., loss of security 
clearance, medical disqualification, loss of eligible NEC, misconduct) or 
when a Sailor has an approved separation with a remaining SRB contract 
obligation.
    b.  Career Waypoints - Reenlistment (C-WAY-REEN).  Commands are 
authorized to submit SRB reenlistment requests prior to a Sailor receiving a 
C-WAY-REEN quota.  However, the C-WAY-REEN quota request must be submitted.  
In these cases, the SRB request will not be processed until the Sailor has 
received C-WAY-REEN confirmation.
SRB requests without C-WAY-REEN quota approval will be rejected in OPINS to 
keep the command informed of potential SRB approval issues.
Once a Sailor has an approved C-WAY-REEN quota, the command should contact 
BUPERS-328 to clear any rejections.  Failure to submit a SRB reenlistment 
request within the required 35 to 120 day submission window due to awaiting a 
C-WAY-REEN quota does not meet eligibility requirements for a 35 day 
submission waiver.
    c.  Sailors with approved SRB requests who do not reenlist on the date or 
for the term specified in the precertification message must have their 
command contact BUPERS-328 to initiate a reenlistment cancellation to avoid 
placing Sailors in an overpaid status.
    d.  To validate an inoperative extension of enlistment and expedite 
processing of an SRB request, include the following information in the 
remarks paragraph of the request:  term, narrative reason, authority, and 
execution date of all inoperative extensions.  Failure to verify extension 
will cause processing delays and may result in rejection of the request or an 
approval at a lower amount.
    e.  Sailors must obtain an approval for extension from BUPERS-
328 in order to minimize the potential for loss of SRB eligibility.

7.  Acceptance of an NEC-specific SRB contract indicates an agreement between 
the Sailor and the Navy to use skills attributed to the NEC during the 
enlistment of the Sailor to meet fleet readiness requirements.  In subsequent 
tours, a Sailor must be willing to be detailed during the normal projected 
rotation date window to an available billet within the SRB contracted NEC, 
consistent with sea-shore flow requirements.  Lateral conversions must follow 
reference (d), paragraph 12d.  Lateral conversion requests will normally not 
be processed more than 9 months before the EAOS.  Conversions to a rate with 
a lower award level normally will not be approved.  Personnel in a closed-
loop NEC can reenlist by the NEC only.

8.  Reference (d), paragraph 12e, provides OBLISERV to Train (OTT) guidance.  
Requests are to be submitted to BUPERS-328 extension desk via e-mail.  A copy 
of the authorization message should be retained by the Sailor until the SRB 
reenlistment on graduation day from the course of instruction.  Use code 1CC 
for OTT SRB request in OPINS or NSIPS.  Additionally, OBLISERV requirements 
for schools are provided in reference (e).  OBLISERV will be determined based 
on the course length as provided in paragraph 3.b. of reference (e).  
Paragraph

3.c.(1) no longer applies.

9.  In keeping with Department of Defense (DoD) policy, Sailors who accepted 
an enlistment bonus for extended enlistment (EBEE), as reflected on their 
Enlisted Bonus Payment Checklist (NAVCRUIT 1133/52, Enlistment Guarantees, 
New Accession Training Program Enlistment Guarantee or Professional 
Apprenticeship Career Track Program Enlistment Guarantees), are not 
authorized to use this inoperative extension time in the SRB calculation.  
Sailors who have inoperative extension time through a 5-year obligation or 6-
year obligation program may continue to have up to 24 months of inoperative 
extension time count towards the SRB calculation provided the reenlistment 
results in a new EAOS that is at least 24 months day-for-day past the current 
extended EAOS.  This calculation is performed automatically by BUPERS-328.  
Local commands are not authorized to cancel or change extensions for the 
purpose of immediate SRB reenlistments.  Commands must verify and annotate on 
the precertification request whether any inoperative extension time noted is 
part of an EBEE contract.

10.  Repayment policy is governed by section 373 of Title 37 of U.S.
Code, Chapter 2, Volume 7A, of the DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR), 
and reference (d), which collectively determines when repayment of the 
unearned portion of a bonus is required or not required but left to 
Secretarial discretion, or prohibited.  Section 373 of Title 37 of U.S. Code 
requires repayment with certain exceptions.  As a general rule, repayment of 
any unearned portion of a bonus will be sought.

11.  To ensure all requirements and timelines are met, visit the following 
SRB page of the NPC website at http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/Pages/SRB.aspx.

12.  The point of contact for a Sailor who has reenlisted and has not 
received their SRB payment, or has questions concerning the taxation of their 
SRB and annual installments, is the servicing pay office or personnel support 
detachment of the Sailor.  SRB tax information is also discussed in DoD FMR, 
Volume 7A, Chapter 44, table 44-1, rule 7.  The point of contact for a Sailor 
with questions regarding the SRB program or any information on their on- line 
personnel account is their CCC.  For technical questions or clarification, 
CCCs, not individual Sailors, are encouraged to contact the Community 
Management Support Branch, BUPERS-328, at (901) 874-321 or (901) 874-3915/
DSN 882 or via e-mail at mill_incen_pays(at)navy.mil, or contact the SRB Help 
Desk at (901) 874-2526/DSN 882.

13.  We will continue to assess retention behavior and adjust SRB award 
levels accordingly.

14.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
