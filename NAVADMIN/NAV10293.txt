POSITIONS BOTH AT SEA AND ASHORE.  DUE TO OUR  POSITIVE CURRENT 
RETENTION LEVELS AND AFTER ANALYZING SSIP PERFORMANCE OVER THE LAST  
SEVEN YEARS, THE SSIP PROGRAM IS BEING ADJUSTED.  THE INTENT OF THIS 
ADJUSTMENT IS TO  INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SSIP IN RETAINING 
SUBMARINE SUPPORT OFFICERS AT  CERTAIN KEY CAREER MILESTONES.

THE SSIP PROGRAM.
