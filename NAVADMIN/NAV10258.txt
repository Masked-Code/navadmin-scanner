AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1500.77 LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT ROADMAPS FOR 
ENLISTED  SAILORS//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE AVAILABILITY OF THE LEARNING AND 
DEVELOPMENT  ROADMAP (LADR) FOR ALL ENLISTED RATINGS AND PAY GRADES.  
LADR IS A SAILOR-FOCUSED  TOOL THAT PROVIDES GUIDANCE ALONG A CAREER 
DEVELOPMENT CONTINUUM TO ENHANCE A SAILOR'S PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.  
ALL RATING SPECIFIC LADRS WERE CRAFTED BY LEARNING CENTER SUBJECT 
MATTER EXPERTS WITH INPUT FROM THE ENLISTED COMMUNITY MANAGERS AND HAVE 
BEEN VALIDATED BY THE FLEET.

2.  EACH RATING-SPECIFIC LADR IS ORGANIZED AROUND SIGNIFICANT CAREER 
PHASES TO ENABLE TARGETED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND SEQUENCED TO MATCH 
GROWING AND CHANGING ROLES THROUGHOUT A CAREER.  INITIAL LADR FOCUS IS 
ON DEVELOPMENT OF A SOLID TECHNICAL AND ANALYTICAL FOUNDATION 
SUPPORTING TACTICAL AND OPERATIONAL COMPETENCIES (BRILLIANT ON THE 
BASICS).  AS SAILORS ADVANCE, LADR EMPHASIS INCLUDES STRATEGIC 
PERSPECTIVES, EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESS PRACTICES.  CONTINUOUS 
USE OF LADR ALLOWS SAILORS TO EFFECTIVELY CHART PROGRESS TOWARD 
ACCOMPLISHMENT OF NAVY-VALUED PROFESSIONAL CAREER GOALS.

3.  FOR SUPERVISORS, LADRS ARE A VALUABLE, RATE-SPECIFIC GUIDE FOR 
MENTORING AND DEVELOPING SAILORS.  LADR FAMILIARIZATION WILL BE  
INTRODUCED AT RECRUIT TRAINING WITH FOLLOW ON DISCUSSIONS DURING "A" 
SCHOOL ON PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND PERSONAL USE.  COMMAND 
INDOCTRINATION PROVIDES ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEADERSHIP TO 
REINFORCE THE VALUE OF LADR IN INDIVIDUAL SAILOR DEVELOPMENT.  PER REF 
A, LADR WILL BE USED AS PART OF SAILOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT BOARDS IN 
PROVIDING LEADERS WITH TOOLS TO RECOGNIZE AND REINFORCE A SAILOR'S 
FORWARD PROGRESS, ALONG WITH PROVIDING POSITIVE JOB AND CHARACTER 
TRAITS.  LADR ALSO PROVIDES SAILORS WITH BASELINE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR 
CAREER PROGRESSION AND ASSISTS THEM IN SETTING REALISTIC CAREER GOALS.

4.  REF A DIRECTS FLEET COMMANDERS/TYPE COMMANDERS/TRAINING COMMANDERS 
TO ENSURE DISTRIBUTION OF LADR TO EVERY ENLISTED PAY GRADE AT ALL 
COMMANDS.  THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE HOMEPAGE OF NAVY 
KNOWLEDGE ON LINE (NKO).  ON NKO'S HOME PAGE, SELECT THE CAREER 
MANAGEMENT TAB; NAVIGATE ALONG THE BLUE SIDE BANNER; AND SELECT THE 
ENLISTED LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT (LADR) HYPERLINK.

5.  NAVY TOTAL FORCE STRATEGIC VISION RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO ANTICIPATE 
NAVY WAR-FIGHTING NEEDS; IDENTIFY ASSOCIATED PERSONNEL CAPABILITIES; 
AND RECRUIT, DEVELOP, MANAGE AND DEPLOY SAILORS IN AN AGILE AND COST-
EFFECTIVE MANNER.  LADR SUPPORTS THIS VISION BY PROVIDING A TOOL BOTH 
INDIVIDUAL SAILORS AND LEADERS CAN USE AS THEY SEEK TO CHART AND 
ACCOMPLISH THEIR PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL GOALS THROUGHOUT THEIR NAVY 
CAREER.

6.  POINT OF CONTACT IS MR. THOMAS SMITH, NETC N527, COMM (850) 452-
7271/DSN 922 OR E-MAIL THOMAS.A.SMITH4(AT)NAVY.MIL.
