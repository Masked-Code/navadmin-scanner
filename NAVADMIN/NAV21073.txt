RMKS/1.  The Navy continues to utilize a conditions-based approach to 
personnel movement and travel to mitigate the risks associated with the 
coronavirus pandemic.  This NAVADMIN cancels references (a) through (c), and 
in line with references (d) and (e) reissues guidance for a conditions-based 
approach to coronavirus disease 2019 personnel movement and travel.  Notably, 
the conditions to resume unrestricted travel now rest on installation-level 
data regarding surrounding Department of Defense (DoD) installation, 
facilities and locations.  To assist in identifying changes to policy and 
procedures, paragraphs in this NAVADMIN that include changes to the intent of 
previous content have [MOD] at the beginning.  Delegations authorized in 
references (e) and (f) remain in effect.  This NAVADMIN further delegates 
approval authority to the O-6 or GS-15 equivalent level for uncontested 
Permanent Change of Station (PCS) travel waivers.  All commands shall 
continue to take specific actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 
worldwide and Department of the Navy (DON) Service Members will adhere to 
current and subsequent Force Health Protection Guidance (FHPG), references 
(g) through (m) and Navy guidance provided in references (n) through (r).  
Immunized individuals are not required to perform Restriction of Movement 
(ROM) before, during or after travel within the United States unless 
directed, but must maintain Health Protection Measures in accordance with 
(IAW) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance.  Individuals 
traveling to, from or through a foreign country should comply with ROM 
guidance in reference (i).  *ROM* and *immunized* are both defined within 
reference (n).  For authorized travel, it is the Service Members 
responsibility to ensure compliance with country, state and local COVID-19 
requirements to include COVID-19 testing as described in references (i) and 
(s).
This NAVADMIN does not cancel or supersede Combatant Commander
(CCDR) guidance for forces assigned or allocated to that Combatant Command 
(CCMD) or within that CCMD Area of Responsibility (AOR).
    1.A.  This guidance applies to all DON Service Members and their 
dependents whose travel is Government-funded, both internationally and 
domestically.
    1.B.  Except as provided below in paragraph 3.C. (exemptions), this 
travel guidance applies to all official travel, including temporary duty 
(TDY) travel; Government-funded leave travel; permanent duty travel, 
including permanent change of station (PCS) travel; and travel related to 
Authorized Departures (AD) and Ordered Departures (OD) issued by the 
Department of State (DOS).
    1.C.  Reference (n) contains authoritative guidance for all personnel and 
units deploying to and from homeport (originating unit location for reserve 
personnel).

2.  [MOD] Conditions-based Approach to Unrestricted Travel.
    2.A.  [MOD] Conditions for unrestricted travel rest on installation-level 
data regarding conditions in and surrounding DoD installations, facilities 
and locations.
    2.B.  As delegated to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) by references 
(e) and (f) and further delegated by this NAVADMIN, the applicable Navy 
Component Commander (NCC), as well as other military departments, CCDRs and 
the Director of Administration and Management (DA and M) for non-Navy 
installations, will continuously assess each DoD installation, facility or 
location under their purview for the feasibility of lifting travel 
restrictions.  There are four factors that will be reported in order to make 
this assessment:  (1) removal of local travel restrictions (Commander, Navy 
Installations Command (CNIC Lead)), (2) availability of essential services 
(e.g., schools, childcare, moving services) (CNIC Lead), (3) quality 
control/assurance capability for household goods packing and moving (Naval 
Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Lead) reporting to CNIC for inclusion in 
weekly report as described below) and (4) favorable Health Protection 
Condition (HPCON) (below HPCON C) (CNIC Lead).
Assessments of the criteria will include consultation with the other Services 
who have installations in the local surrounding area and will take into 
account the areas where installation personnel reside.  Specifically, 
installations/facilities within a 50-mile commuting distance will coordinate 
their assessments and plans.  Any Navy installation, facility or location 
that meets all of the criteria above, as reported by CNIC, will be assessed 
by the applicable NCC to determine unrestricted travel to or from these 
locations.  The above criteria and whether or not an installation is 
restricted for travel will then be reported by CNIC to the Office of the 
Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(PR)), Office of 
the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy (DASD 
(MPP))(with an information copy to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy 
(Manpower and Reserve Affairs) (ASN (M and RA)) staff on a weekly basis (via 
the Navy Operations Center (NOC)), using a pre-formatted spreadsheet provided 
by DASD (MPP).
    2.C.  Advana is the primary platform the USD(PR) will be using to track 
implementation of a conditions-based approach to personnel movement and 
travel.  An extract of the Advana information required for implementation of 
this NAVADMIN is displayed for Navy use via MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/don-covid-19-travel-
tracker.

3.  Personnel Movement and Travel.
    3.A.  [MOD] Unrestricted travel may resume between installations when 
both the gaining and losing installations have met the assessment criteria 
described in paragraph 2.B. and either the DA and M, applicable NCC (as 
detailed above) or the CCDRs have lifted travel restrictions for an 
installation.  A location is considered *green* when travel restrictions are 
lifted.  The status of travel restrictions will be posted weekly on MyNavy 
Portal at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/don-covid-19-travel-tracker and at 
https://www.defense.gov/Explore/Spotlight/Coronavirus/.
    3.B.  [MOD] Considerations for Unrestricted Travel.  Though travel may be 
approved as unrestricted based on the gaining and losing locations both 
reflected as *green* (i.e. Travel Restrictions Lifted), risk of COVID-19 
exposure may still exist during transit.
COs and OICs shall review travel plans with Service Members to ensure 
appropriate force health protection measures are implemented, including ROM 
if warranted.  Gaining COs (including for intermediate stops (I-stops)) shall 
evaluate the manner and location of travel for incoming Sailors and their 
immunization status to determine the necessity of ROM for each individual.  
Coordination among the losing command, training command en route (if 
applicable) and gaining command is required to determine if ROM requirements 
are necessary.
Commands and individual Service Members shall remain vigilant and implement 
reasonable measures to reduce risk of exposure and infection where 
appropriate.
          3.B.1.  PCS.  At least 30 days prior to Service Members executing 
PCS orders, the losing command shall check the status of losing and gaining 
locations in MyNavy Portal at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/don-covid-19-
travel-tracker.  If both gaining and losing locations are *green*, no waiver 
is required and normal PCS procedures apply.  If either gaining or losing 
locations are not *green*, then the procedures in paragraph 4 apply and the 
losing command should contact the Navy Personnel Command (NPC) Career 
Management Pillar Branch (PERS-4) Placement Officer or Placement Coordinator 
to determine whether an orders modification
(ORDMOD) or waiver is more appropriate.
          3.B.2.  Other Official Travel (Meetings, Conferences, Site Visits, 
etc.).  Prior to issuing a set of temporary duty (TDY) orders, COs or OICs 
shall review MyNavy Portal at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/don-covid-19-
travel-tracker.  If both the gaining and losing locations are *green*, no 
waiver is required and normal TDY procedures apply.  If either the gaining or 
losing locations are not *green*, then the procedures in paragraph 4 apply.
          3.B.3.  Travel for Official Training.  COs or OICs (for training 
not associated with a set of PCS orders) or Training Command COs or OICs (for 
training associated with a set of PCS orders) shall check the status of a 
training location, I-stop or ultimate duty location via MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/don-covid-19-travel-tracker before allowing a 
Navy Service Member to execute travel.  If the gaining, I-stop (if 
applicable), and losing locations are *green*, no waiver is required and 
normal TDY or PCS procedures apply.  If either the gaining, I-stop or losing 
locations are not *green*, then the procedures in paragraph 4 apply.
          3.B.4.  Locations not reflected on MyNavy Portal.  For PCS or TDY 
considered in paragraphs 3.B.1. through 3.B.3., if a location is not listed 
in the DON COVID-19 Travel Tracker on MyNavy Portal, the decision to allow 
unrestricted travel should be made based on the status of the closest DoD 
installation, facility or location.
          3.B.5.  Changes in Status.  As assessments are made weekly, a 
change in status may occur prior to travel.  If a Service Member was approved 
for travel and either one or both locations then turn *red* (i.e. travel 
restrictions in place) prior to departure/return, travel would then require a 
waiver (in line with paragraph 4.D.) or ORDMOD for PCS travel.  For PCS 
travel, the losing command should contact the PERS-4 Placement Officer or 
Placement Coordinator to determine whether a waiver or ORDMOD is more 
appropriate.
    3.C.  Exemptions.  The following circumstances are exempt from travel 
restrictions per reference (d):
          3.C.1.  Travel associated with uniformed personnel recruiting and 
accessions activities, to include accessions, basic training, advanced 
military individual training and follow-on travel to the first duty station.
          3.C.2.  Travel by patients (to include those on the Temporary 
Disability Retired List (TDRL)), as well as their authorized escorts and 
attendants, for purposes of medical treatment.  Travel by medical providers 
for the purposes of medical treatment for DoD personnel and their families is 
also authorized.
          3.C.3.  Travel for Global Force Management (GFM) activities 
(defined as deployments/redeployments ordered in the GFM Allocation Plan 
(GFMAP) and CCMD Assigned Force Demand Tasking, including Service internal 
rotations to support and TDY used to source ordered capabilities).  Such 
travel to execute Operations, Activities and Investments or Service-related 
training will be coordinated between the CCDR, the Joint Staff (JS) and the 
appropriate military department.  All GFM-scheduled deployments/redeployments 
of U.S. Navy vessels and embarked units and personnel are authorized, 
provided they have met the ROM guidance set forth in references (n) and any 
applicable subsequent guidance.
          3.C.4.  Travel authorized by the Commander, U.S.
Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), to continue execution of the Joint 
Deployment and Distribution Enterprise as required to project and sustain the 
Joint Force globally.  This includes forces (aircrews, vessel crews and 
mission essential personnel) ordered on prepare-to-deploy orders alert 
status, air refueling, global patient movement, mortuary affairs support, 
inland surface, sea and air sustainment missions, support to other U.S. 
Agencies (as approved by the Secretary of Defense (SecDef)) and moves of 
personnel and equipment that support USTRANSCOM global posture requirements.
          3.C.5.  Travel by military personnel pending retirement or 
separation.  Specific to Navy Service Members, travel is authorized to take 
terminal leave.
          3.C.6.  Travel by those under authority of a Chief of Mission and 
authorized by that Chief of Mission.  Travel from locations where the DoS has 
issued an OD, and return travel from safe havens when the DoS has terminated 
an OD or AD.
          3.C.7.  Travel to and from Professional Military Education Programs 
(defined by Navy as in-resident graduate education including in-resident 
Joint Professional Military Education (JPME)).
          3.C.8.  Personal leave and liberty travel outside of the local area 
is exempt from COVID-19 related travel restrictions.  Approval authority for 
leave outside of the local area will be determined by the echelon 2 
commander, but may be delegated by the echelon 2 commander to no lower than 
the unit CO, OIC or equivalent (Branch Head, Division Director, etc.).
                  3.C.8.a. [MOD]  Commanders and supervisors will follow the 
procedures in reference (i) to include conducting a risk assessment of the 
health status and travel itinerary for Navy Service Members requesting leave 
or liberty outside the local area.
Navy Service Members will comply with any DoD, component, federal, state and 
local restrictions while in a leave/liberty status.  The DoD COVID-19 Travel 
Information App (https://covid-status.data.mil) provides useful tools to 
assist with making risk informed decisions on approving leave and 
implementing the appropriate mitigation measures when individuals return from 
leave.

4.  [MOD] Restricted Travel Policy.  This portion of the NAVADMIN applies to 
areas where travel restrictions are in place (i.e. *red*).  All personnel 
should follow federal, state and local (including host nation) direction, as 
well as direction from their chain of command, including observing *Stay at 
Home* orders if in effect, maximizing telework based on mission priorities 
and practicing social distancing.  Reference (t)  provides additional 
guidance on exemption from state and local executive orders if necessary to 
ensure continuity of critical functions.  Do not restrict mission essential 
travel by immunized individuals unless unusual conditions call for immunized 
travel to be restricted (e.g. close contact with a COVID positive greater 
than 3 months after immunization).
    4.A.  PCS
          4.A.1.  Execution of PCS orders from or to locations where travel 
is restricted requires a waiver IAW paragraph 4.D.
          4.A.2.  A local PCS move may be executed without a waiver since it 
does not involve travel outside of the local area.  Same geographic location 
PCS moves will only be executed with due regard to the operational readiness 
of the commands involved.  Losing and gaining commands are encouraged to 
coordinate with placement coordinators and detailers in PERS-4 as required.  
PERS-4 shall adjudicate same geographic location PCS move decisions in 
situations where losing and gaining commands do not agree on an execution 
timeline.  This adjudication may be delegated, but no lower than the
O-6 Division Director level at PERS-4.
    4.B.  Other Official Travel (Meetings, Conferences, Site Visits, etc.).  
All other official travel by Navy Service Members from or to an area where 
travel is restricted will require a waiver IAW paragraph 4.D.  Navy Reserve 
personnel will follow guidance promulgated by the Chief of Navy Reserve (CNR) 
in references (u) and (v).
    4.C.  Travel for Official Training.
          4.C.1.  Navy Service Members traveling to attend formal training 
from or to an area where travel is restricted will require a waiver IAW 
paragraph 4.D.  Advance coordination with the training command is required 
prior to travel.  Service Members will comply with reference (n) and any NCC 
guidance concerning pre- and post- travel medical screening and reception 
procedures, to include ROM if applicable.
          4.C.2.  [MOD] Naval Education and Training Command (NETC) Learning 
Centers will continue to support Fleet mission-essential training to the 
maximum extent possible while minimizing risk to force and balancing risk to 
mission, strictly abiding by CDC, DoD and Bureau of Medicine and Surgery 
(BUMED) guidance in the classroom/trainer environment.  For all accession 
level courses, ROM shall be required before commencing training unless 
students are immunized or arrive via bubble-to-bubble/protected travel.  For 
all other courses, ROM will not be required for immunized personnel.
For others not immunized, ROM will be at the discretion of the schoolhouse 
COs based on risk to force.  Fleet units shall coordinate ROM requirements, 
if required, with the schoolhouse before permitting student travel.  Type 
Commanders (TYCOMS) should validate each individual training requirements 
mission-essentiality in light of the risk to force, and then coordinate with 
NETC to implement risk mitigations (i.e., reduced throughput, extra course 
convenings, ROM, etc.).
    4.D.  Travel Restriction Waivers.  Waivers to travel restrictions may be 
granted in writing in cases where the travel is:
1) Determined to be mission-essential, 2) Necessary for humanitarian reasons 
or 3) Warranted due to extreme hardship.  These waivers are to be executed on 
a case-by-case basis, must be determined to be in the best interest of the 
U.S. Government and shall be coordinated between the gaining and losing 
organizations.  Mission-essential travel refers to work that must be 
performed to ensure the continued operations of mission-essential functions, 
including positions that are deemed key and essential, as determined by the 
responsible DoD Component.
          4.D.1.  Commands shall maintain a record of all travel waivers 
granted.  Waivers granted prior to the date time group of this NAVADMIN under 
references (a) and (b) are still valid.
          4.D.2.  COs and OICs may request a waiver via their chain of 
command to paragraphs 4.A. through 4.C.  Approval authority for waivers 
belongs to the CCDR if the individual is assigned or allocated to a CCMD, the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
(CJCS) if the individual is assigned to the JS, the DA and M for personnel in 
the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Defense Agencies, DoD Field 
Activities (and any other DoD entities not listed in this paragraph) and 
finally to the Secretary of the Navy
(SECNAV) for personnel under his jurisdiction.  In line with reference (e) 
and modified by reference (f), SECNAV has delegated this authority to the 
Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and this NAVADMIN delegates waiver approval 
as follows:
                  4.D.2.a.  [MOD] PCS travel waiver requests shall be 
submitted for all Service Members with written orders if either gaining or 
losing command have travel restrictions in place (i.e.
*red*).  Gaining and losing commands will endorse concurrence or non-
concurrence.  If both the gaining and losing command concur with the waiver 
(i.e. waiver is uncontested), the gaining command, at a level no lower than 
O-6 or civilian equivalent, is delegated the authority to approve travel 
waivers for Navy Service Member PCS travel in paragraphs 4.A. and 4.C 
(training associated with PCS orders).  Approval authority is responsible for 
submitting the approved waiver to PERS-4 for tracking purposes and notifying 
the losing command.  All contested waivers will be adjudicated by PERS-4.  
Approvals or disapprovals of contested waiver requests shall be made via 
message traffic to all concerned and will specify whether dependents are 
authorized to accompany the Navy Service Member.  All approved waivers and 
contested waiver requests shall be submitted to pers451(at)navy.mil with the 
subject line PCS WAIVER APPROVAL or PCS WAIVER REQUEST as applicable.  Waiver 
request formats are posted on MyNavy Portal.  Navy Service Members who are 
granted a waiver should review the latest version of COVID-19 Standard 
Operational Guidance and FHPGs.
                  4.D.2.b.  Authority to approve or deny travel waivers for 
Navy Service Members in the case of:  (1) official travel in paragraph 4.B., 
and (2) official training, not associated with a PCS, in paragraph 4.C. is 
delegated to the echelon 2 commander.  The echelon 2 commander may further 
delegate waiver authority, but no lower than the first O-6 or a civilian 
equivalent in the chain of command of the Service Member.  Those who are 
granted a waiver will comply with the NCC guidance concerning pre- and post-
travel screening and reception procedures.

5.  Points of Contact.
    5.A.  Sailor Support.  Service Members with questions regarding this 
NAVADMIN should contact the MyNavy Career Center (1-833-330-
6622) or e-mail askmncc(at)navy.mil.
    5.B.  Medical Questions.  BUMED Watch:  703-681-1087/1125 or NIPR e-mail:  
usn.ncr.bumedfchva.list.bumed---2019-ncov-response-
cell(at)mail.mil.

7.  This conditions-based approach prioritizes the health and safety of our 
personnel, their families and our communities, while balancing mission 
requirements, the need to advance Navy Service Member career opportunities 
and other imperatives.  COs and OICs must continuously review current HPCON, 
FHPG supplements and Service Member immunization status when making risk 
informed decisions such as holding in-person conferences or determining the 
maximum size of gatherings.  It is incumbent upon COs and OICs to balance 
risk to mission and risk to force to ensure we, as a Navy, can continue to 
meet our mission while simultaneously preventing the spread of
COVID-19 within the Navy and the communities we live in to the greatest 
extent possible.
