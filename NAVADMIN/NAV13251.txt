AVIATION INCENTIVE PAYS.  REF B IS OPNAVINST 7220.18, AVIATION CAREER 
INCENTIVE PAY.// 

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the FY-13 flight hour verification process 
for conditional Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP) and Hazardous Duty 
Incentive Pay (HDIP) for flying programs.  Per ref (a), this process enables 
the Navy to accurately compensate officers for frequent and regular 
performance of operational flying duty.  
Per ref (b), commanding officers are required to track and report flight 
hours for conditional ACIP and HDIP for flying recipients.  
This verification certifies that the FY-13 minimum flight hour requirement 
was met by all flying recipients eligible for conditional ACIP and HDIP.

2.  Conditional ACIP may be paid to those aeronautically designated officers 
in the following categories:
    a.  Aeromedical officers.
    b.  Aviation officers not meeting the required Months of Flying (MOF) at 
the 12-year or 18-year gate and not having a SECNAV-approved waiver.
    c.  Aviation officers O6 and below with more than 25 years of aviation 
service.

3.  In order to be eligible for conditional ACIP, an officer shall be under 
orders to Duty in a Flying Status Involving Operational or Training Flights 
(DIFOPS), reported into a billet designated XXX1 or XXX2 (a DIFOPS billet), 
and flying the minimum hours prescribed in ref (a).

4.  HDIP for flying may be paid to non-aeronautically designated officers and 
aeronautically designated flag officers (with more than 25 years of aviation 
service) required by competent orders to participate in regular and frequent 
aerial flights as crew or  non-crew members.  HDIP for flying eligibility 
requires a non-aeronautically designated officer to be under orders to Duty 
in a Flying Status as a Technical Observer (DIFTECH).  An aeronautically 
designated flag officer must be under orders to DIFOPS to maintain HDIP for 
flying eligibility.  All must fly the minimum hours prescribed in ref (a).  
Officers entitled to ACIP are not entitled to HDIP for flying.

5.  Upon the end of FY-13, all conditional ACIP and HDIP for flying 
recipients will be required to provide flight hours from April 2012 to 
September 2013 (inclusive) to Commander, Naval Personnel Command
(PERS-435) ACIP Program Manager.  Required format for flight hour submissions 
and commanding officer endorsement letters are located in ref (b), and are 
available on the Navy Personnel Command website  at 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/reference/instructions/pages/default.aspx.  
Eligible members shall submit their FY-13 flight hours and command 
endorsement NLT 31 December 2013.  If a member did not complete the minimum 
flight hour requirements as established in ref (a), recoupment for unearned 
entitlements will be collected.  Potential underpayments will also be 
corrected.  If no flight hours are submitted by 31 December 2013, the members 
entitlement to ACIP or HDIP for flying will stop and he or she will forfeit 
his or her FY-13 entitlement to conditional ACIP or HDIP for flying.  The 
repayment process of the ACIP received will be initiated as applicable.

6.  Members shall send original flight hour submissions and command 
endorsements to:
    Commander Naval Personnel Command
    PERS-435
    5720 Integrity Drive
    Millington, TN 38055-4300
Submission via fax is authorized, but hardcopy of the original documents must 
be submitted to the address above.  If desired, please fax submissions to 
(901) 874-2721/2756, attention PERS-435.

7.  Once flight hours are received, verification of hours flown and monthly 
entitlement(s) earned will be calculated by PERS-435.  Overpayment and 
underpayments will be forwarded to Defense Financing and Accounting Services 
(DFAS) for the appropriate corrective action.
Negotiation of repayment plans for recoupment may be discussed directly with 
the members servicing personnel support detachment.  Verifications for FY-12 
and earlier shall not be accepted.

8.  Point of contact is LCDR Ganci, ACIP Program Manager (PERS-435), at (901)
