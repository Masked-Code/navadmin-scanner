DIVERSITY POLICY, WHICH DIRECTS LEADERS TO ANTICIPATE AND EMBRACE THE 
DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES OF TOMORROW AND BUILD A NAVY THAT WILL REFLECT THE 
MAKE UP OF OUR COUNTRY.  AS LEADERS, WE MUST PROMOTE DIVERSITY AND 
UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS A NECESSITY FOR OUR NAVY TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, 
RELEVANT, AND A STRONG GLOBAL FORCE FOR PEACE.  ACCORDINGLY, I 
ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT PARTICIPATION IN THIS YEAR'S NNOA NATIONAL
