RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN addresses the Navys discontinued use of the Digital 
Nautical Chart (DNC), the submarine specific product MATT, and Tactical Ocean 
Data (TOD) by fiscal year (FY) 2025 and its transition to the Electronic 
Navigational Chart (ENC) (using the IHO S-57 data format standard), Submarine 
ENC, and Additional Military Layers (AML).  The adoption of ENC enables the 
ability to create and display AMLs which overlay additional information on 
the navigation chart that is not available on paper or DNC.

2.  With this transition, AML will replace TOD 0, TOD 4, and anti-submarine 
warfare (ASW) bathymetry products.  NGA will release limited coverage of ENC, 
SMENC, and AML in FY20 and complete global coverage by FY24.

3.  Ships equipped with ENC-approved Electronic Chart Display and Information 
System (ECDIS) software shall use ENC where and when available, and continue 
to use DNC where and when ENC is not available.  Navy programs relying on DNC 
for navigational or non-navigational purposes shall plan for DNC termination 
in FY25.

4.  The AML data layer requirements are currently being generated and will 
include (not all-inclusive) contour line bathymetry; environment, seabed and 
beach; large bottom objects; maritime foundation and facilities; routes, 
areas, and limits; and small bottom objects.  Commands should submit 
additional requirements for any other desired information and unmet data 
display needs as AML requirements to their Type Commander.

5.  Released by VADM Jeffrey E. Trussler, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations 
for Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
