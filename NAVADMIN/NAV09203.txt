MUST CONSULT WITH THEIR CAREER COUNSELORS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND IT.  
THIS NAVADMIN IS BROKEN INTO FOUR PARTS: ELIGIBILITY, PROCESS, SERVICE 
OBLIGATION POLICY, AND REFERENCE INFORMATION.

PART I - ELIGIBILITY
1.  PER REF A, TRANSFERABILITY UNDER THE POST 9-11 GI BILL IS A 
RECRUITING AND RETENTION TOOL.  WHILE AN INDIVIDUAL MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR 
EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THE POST 9-11 GI BILL, GENERALLY THE 
OPTION TO TRANSFER A MEMBER'S UNUSED BENEFITS TO A FAMILY MEMBER 
(SPOUSE/CHILDREN ENROLLED IN THE DEFENSE ELIGIBILITY ENROLLMENT SYSTEM
(DEERS)) REQUIRES AN ADDITIONAL SERVICE COMMITMENT IN THE ARMED FORCES 
(ACTIVE DUTY AND/OR SELECTED RESERVE (SELRES)).  
2.  THE TRANSFERABILITY OPTION MUST BE ELECTED WHILE THE MEMBER IS 
SERVING IN THE ARMED FORCES.  ACTIVE MEMBERS WHO SEPARATE, RETIRE, 
TRANSFER TO THE FLEET RESERVE OR WHO ARE DISCHARGED PRIOR TO
1 AUGUST 2009, ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO ELECT TRANSFERABILITY.  SELRES 
MEMBERS WHO TRANSFER TO THE RETIRED RESERVE (WITH OR WITHOUT PAY), 
TRANSFER TO THE INDIVIDUAL READY RESERVE OR WHO ARE DISCHARGED PRIOR TO 
1 AUGUST 2009, ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO ELECT TRANSFERABILITY.  
3.  PER REF B, MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES WHO ELECT TO TRANSFER
BENEFITS:
    A.  MUST HAVE SERVED SIX YEARS IN THE ARMED FORCES (ACTIVE AND/OR
SELRES) AND AGREE TO SERVE FOUR ADDITIONAL YEARS IN THE ARMED FORCES 
FROM THE DATE OF ELECTION; OR,
    B.  MUST HAVE SERVED AT LEAST TEN YEARS IN THE ARMED FORCES AND IF 
EITHER NAVY, DOD POLICY OR FEDERAL STATUTE RESTRICTS THE MEMBER FROM 
COMMITTING TO FOUR ADDITIONAL YEARS, MEMBERS MUST AGREE TO SERVE THE 
MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME ALLOWED BY THAT POLICY OR STATUTE; OR, 
    C.  IS OR BECOMES RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE (COMPLETION OF 20 YEARS OF

        (1) FOR THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR RETIREMENT ON 1 AUGUST 2009, NO 
ADDITIONAL SERVICE IS REQUIRED.

1 AUGUST 2009 AND BEFORE 1 JULY 2010, NO ADDITIONAL SERVICE IS REQUIRED.
        (3) FOR THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR RETIREMENT AFTER 1 AUGUST 2009 AND 
BEFORE 1 AUGUST 2010, ONE YEAR OF ADDITIONAL SERVICE IS REQUIRED.
        (4) FOR THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR RETIREMENT ON OR AFTER 1 AUGUST 2010 
AND BEFORE 1 AUGUST 2011, TWO YEARS OF ADDITIONAL SERVICE IS REQUIRED.

ENTITLEMENT MAY RESULT IN AN OVERPAYMENT OF EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND

ADDED, ENTITLEMENTS CHANGED OR UNUSED ENTITLEMENTS REVOKED.  THESE 
CHANGES WILL BE MADE BY THE MEMBER THROUGH THE TRANSFERABILITY OF
