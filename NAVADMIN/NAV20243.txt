COLLECTION ACTIVITIES.// 
 
RMKS/1.  Per reference (a), the U.S. Navy is a key target for Foreign 
Intelligence Entities (FIEs) collection efforts to steal our significant 
technical advantage over our competitors and degrade our strategic lethal 
overmatch of our adversaries.  DON counterintelligence (CI) components (U.S. 
Navy CI, U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) CI and Naval Criminal Investigation Service 
(NCIS)) and the Intelligence Community (IC) conduct CI activities to identify 
FIE efforts to target sensitive and classified information pertaining to 
Department of the Navy (DON) technology, plans, order of battle, 
capabilities, and intentions. 
 
2.  Authority.  Per references (b) through (d), the commanders and heads of 
the intelligence and CI elements of the Navy will:  (1) collect (including 
through clandestine means), produce, analyze and disseminate defense and 
defense-related intelligence and CI to support departmental requirements, 
and, as appropriate, national requirements; (2) conduct CI activities; (3) 
monitor the development, procurement and management of intelligence systems 
and equipment; and (4) conduct military intelligence liaison 
relationships.  Specifically, Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) has authorized 
Navy CI personnel to conduct authorized CI activities on behalf of the 
command to which they are assigned under the authority, direction, and 
control of the Director of Naval Intelligence (DNI).  Activities include:  CI 
Analysis and Production (CI A&P), CI Collection Activities (CCA), CI 
Functional Services (CIFS), and support to NCIS CI Investigations and NCIS 
Advanced Offensive CI Operations (OFCO). 
 
3.  Responsibility and Tasks.  Per references (d) and (e), CI activities will 
be undertaken as part of an integrated DOD and national effort.  The Navy 
will integrate CI activities into all operations, programs, systems, 
exercises, plans, doctrine, strategies, policies, and architectures to 
detect, identify, assess, exploit, and deny FIE and their insiders targeting 
or exploiting DON information, personnel, operations and other 
activities.  Navy CI elements will conduct CI A&P; CIFS; CCA; and support to 
NCIS Advanced CI Operations and NCIS CI Investigations.  Per references (d) 
and (f), NCIS is identified as the Military Department Counterintelligence 
Organization (MDCO) and in that role, they are the sole DON CI component 
authorized to conduct CI Investigations of DON personnel. 
 
4.  Coordination.  Per reference (g), the Naval Intelligence Activity (NIA) 
serves as the Executive Agent and Functional Manager for Navy CI and Human 
Intelligence (HUMINT).  The Navy CI Coordinating Authority (NCICA) under the 
authority, direction, and control of the DNI will coordinate, deconflict and 
synchronize CI activities executed by U.S. Navy CI personnel or on behalf of 
the Service.  Per reference (h), if expressly stated in a Secretary of 
Defense (SECDEF) approved plan or order, the Combatant Commander assumes and 
exercises Operational Control over CI forces assigned or attached.  Where 
there is no SECDEF approved plan or order being executed, CI elements and 
activities remain under the command and control of the Service.  In all 
instances, both the U.S. Navy CICA and the affected Combatant Command CICA 
should be part of the coordination, deconfliction and synchronization of 
Service CI activities.  All U.S. Navy CI Inquiries, also called CI Incident 
Assessments (CIIAs), will be coordinated and deconflicted with NCIS before 
initiating to determine the MDCO level of interest in opening an 
investigation on the basis of the initial information.  If there is 
insufficient grounds to open an investigation, a CI Inquiry will be initiated 
to determine if there is a foreign nexus.  If during the conduct of the CI 
Inquiry information of a criminal nature is discovered, the CI Inquiry will 
be halted and the information immediately provided to NCIS.  All information 
identified during the conduct of U.S. Navy CI activities found to be of an 
investigative nature will be passed to NCIS via the Secret Intranet Protocol 
Router Network (SIPR) Consolidated Law Enforcement Operations Center 
(SCLEOC). 
 
5.  CI Support.  All Navy CI support activities in support of Navy commands 
will be conducted as per reference (d) and coordinated through the 
NCICA.  Requests for CI support should be coordinated with Fleet N2X 
components and concerned organization Commanders to ensure the capability is 
employed under the appropriate command and CI authorities.  Due to the 
dynamic nature of CI activities, requests for CI support will require NIA 
validation.  Support requests will not be used as augmentation for Maritime 
Operations Centers or Maritime Intelligence Operations Centers, numbered 
Fleet staffs or to off-set/compensate for permanently assigned personnel, 
individual augmentation shortfalls, or Global Force Management Request for 
Forces. 
 
6.  CI Analysis and Production (CI A&P).  The U.S. Navy will develop analytic 
products to address the threat posed by espionage, international terrorism, 
subversion, sabotage, assassination, and covert activities.  This includes 
other activities that have a FIE nexus.  CI analysis enhances the 
understanding of the intentions of an FIE, foreign security service, an 
international terrorist entity, or other foreign actors and provides 
indications of their limitations, plans, and warning intentions.  CI A&P also 
supports other CI functions of CIFS, CCA, CI Investigations and CI as well as 
support to U.S. Navy foreign intelligence activities.  This includes, but is 
not limited to, analysis for offensive CI operations, investigative lead 
development, threats to personnel and property, threats to the security of 
DON forces and operations, and foreign intelligence collection against DoD 
technology, information systems, and infrastructure. 
 
7.  CI Functional Services (CIFS).  CIFS are CI activities conducted to 
support the four DOD CI missions and that enable one or more of the other CI 
functions.  Per reference (i), CIFS include, but are not limited to:  (1) CI 
Awareness and Reporting briefings; (2) support to arms control and other 
international treaties; (3) support to antiterrorism and force protection; 
(4) support to military operations and training exercises; (5) support to war 
planning; (6) support to foreign visitor programs; (7) CI inquiries (also 
known as CIIAs); (8) liaison and collection activities not associated with 
CCA; (9) CI training; (10) CI surveillance and surveillance detection; (11) 
CI insider threat identification and mitigation efforts; (12) CI support to 
OPSEC programs; (13) CI support to HUMINT collection, asset validation, and 
enabling activities; (14) CI support to research, development, and 
acquisition to include support to Supply Chain Risk Management; (15) CI 
support to counter-proliferation and countering weapons of mass destruction; 
(16) CI support to critical infrastructure protection; (17) CI support to 
security programs; (18) CI support to the Military Accessions Vital to the 
National Interest Program; (19) CI support to foreign award nominations; (20) 
CI support in the screening of contract linguist personnel, and local 
national personnel hired by DoD in overseas locations; and (21) CI support to 
cyber operations.  Specialized technical CIFS of Polygraph and credibility 
assessment support, and Technical Surveillance Countermeasures can only be 
conducted by NCIS. Route requests for specialized technical CIFS support with 
local NCIS Field Office and coordinate through NCICA. 
 
8.  CI Collection Activities (CCA).  U.S. Navy CI elements conduct CCA to 
acquire information about the capabilities, intentions and activities of FIE 
and their insiders who engage in espionage, terrorism, sabotage, subversion, 
and clandestine intelligence activities directed against the United States, 
DOD and the DON.  Per reference (j), CCA includes Military CI Collection, CI 
Questioning of Enemy Prisoners of War and Detainees, CI Debriefs, CI Liaison, 
Open Source and Media Exploitation, and CI Collection in Cyberspace. 
 
9.  The U.S. Navy executes CI as a Service responsibility and a function of 
command, not unlike Operational Security (OPSEC) or force protection.  Navy 
CI Agents are a force multiplier for the DON, working closely with Marine 
Corps CI Agents, and freeing up NCIS limited assets to focus on executing 
advanced CI Operations and CI Investigations for which NCIS has unique 
authorities and placement to perform.
