RMKS/1. The Navy League of the United States (NLUS) will hold its annual Sea-
Air-Space (SAS) exposition from 8 to 10 April 2024 with a co-located youth 
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) exhibition on 7 April 2024 
at the Gaylord National Resort and Conference Center, located in National 
Harbor, MD. SAS provides a platform for the professional development of 
Department of the Navy personnel on the latest developments in naval warfare, 
as well as an opportunity for Navy engagement with representatives from a 
broad cross-section of government, industry, academia, and international 
community. 
 
2. The SAS schedule is designed with a focus on readiness and innovation, 
with panels covering topics such as acquisition, cyber, strategic sealift, 
leadership, shipbuilding, and manpower. SAS will showcase leaders from across 
the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Merchant Marines, other 
governmental agencies, and industry. Additionally, many international 
delegations will be in attendance, including several Heads of Navy (HON). A 
full list of speakers and more information on international representation 
can be found at seaairspace.org/. 
 
3. Per reference (a), attendance at non-DoD hosted conferences which have 
historically exceeded $500,000 may require SECNAV/UNSECNAV approval. SAS 2024 
meets this threshold. Therefore, requests for attendance shall be 
consolidated by Echelon-2 commands and provided to OPNAV N94 via a SECNAV 
report control symbol (RCS) 5050-1 Conference Request Form to N94 POC CDR 
Jason Carrier at Jason.a.carrier.mil(at)us.navy.mil - (703)-693-5574 or Mr. 
Joseph Gradisher at joseph.f.gradisher.civ(at)us.navy.mil - (703)692-5044, 
to track overall costs and attendance data. Conference requests are due no 
later than 1 March 2024 via ETMS2. Overall approval of DON-wide attendance is 
expected in late-February. If no cost is incurred by the government (i.e. 
people local to area), no submission or approval is required. The following 
restrictions apply: 
   a. Subject to command discretion, attendance is authorized for 
local participants at no cost to the government. 
   b. SAS 2024 is primarily an East Coast event. Funded TAD travel from West 
Coast/International commands should be closely examined unless member has an 
active role in the event (sitting on a panel, making an official U.S. Navy 
presentation, etc.). Excessive attendance will be subject to cuts based on 
overall cost. 
   c. NLUS has offered free attendance at the below ten events to all 
military and civilian personnel. Because there is a maximum number of seats 
available, attendees are required to pre-register. 
Per reference (b), this free attendance does not constitute a gift for 
purposes of applicable ethics regulations, and therefore may be accepted by 
all military and civilian personnel.
