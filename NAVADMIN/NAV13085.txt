AMPN/REF A IS MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1306-954, RECRUIT DIVISION COMMANDER (RDC) DUTY.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN SOLICITS SAILORS TO APPLY FOR RECRUIT DIVISION COMMANDER (RDC) 
DUTY AT RECRUIT TRAINING COMMAND (RTC) GREAT LAKES.

2.  RDC'S PERFORM A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE SAILORIZATION PROCESS;  THE MOTIVATION AND 
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR YOUNG SAILORS AT RTC IS A VITAL MISSION, ONE THAT 
REQUIRES THE PRESENCE OF OUTSTANDING ROLE MODELS.  ALL COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO 
IDENTIFY THEIR BEST AND BRIGHTEST SAILORS AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO VOLUNTEER FOR RDC DUTY.

3.  RDCS ARE REWARDED FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND HARD WORK WITH THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:
    A.  $450 PER MONTH SPECIAL DUTY ASSIGNMENT PAY.
    B.  ADDITIONAL ANNUAL CLOTHING ALLOWANCE OF $220.
    C.  FREE DRY CLEANING SERVICES WHILE ACTIVELY TRAINING A RECRUIT DIVISION.
    D.  OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A MASTER TRAINING SPECIALIST QUALIFICATION.
    E.  GUARANTEED CHOICE OF COAST ASSIGNMENT (UPON COMPLETION OF TOUR).
    F.  ADVANCEMENT RATES TO CHIEF AND SENIOR CHIEF ARE CLOSE TO DOUBLE THE NAVY-WIDE 
AVERAGES.
    G.  AWARD OF RECRUIT TRAINING SERVICE RIBBON.
    H.  PARTICIPATION IN THE RTC COMMAND MERITORIOUS ADVANCEMENT PROGRAM FOR SECOND 
CLASS PETTY OFFICERS.

4.  RDC ASSIGNMENT IS CHALLENGING, BUT REWARDING.  IT OFFERS A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT 
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, DIVERSIFICATION, LEADERSHIP, AND CAREER ADVANCEMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES.  HARD-CHARGING, DISCIPLINED SAILORS WHO POSSESS STRONG CHARACTER, 
PERSONAL INTEGRITY, AND WANT TO PURSUE THE MOST CHALLENGING DUTY ASHORE ARE 
ENCOURAGED TO VOLUNTEER FOR DUTY AS AN RDC.  INITIAL ORDERS ARE TO RDC "C" SCHOOL VIA A 
THREE-WEEK INTERMEDIATE STOP AT A NAVY INSTRUCTOR TRAINING COURSE TO OBTAIN THE 9502 
NEC.  THE COURSE IS CONDUCTED AT MULTIPLE NAVY SITES AND IS A PREREQUISITE FOR RDC DUTY.
CANDIDATES MUST PASS RDC "C" SCHOOL WHICH IS A 13-WEEK PHYSICALLY CHALLENGING, INTENSIVE, 
HANDS-ON TRAINING COURSE THAT PROVIDES PROSPECTIVE RDCS WITH THE SKILLS, PERSPECTIVE, AND 
PHYSICAL READINESS TO SUCCEED AS AN RDC.  ALL CANDIDATES WILL BE REQUIRED TO PASS THE RDC 
PFA WHICH MANDATES COMPLETION OF THE RUN PORTION OF THE PRT DURING "C" SCHOOL.  THE 
MOST COMMON REASON FOR ATTRITION DURING TRAINING IS RDC PFA FAILURE.

5.  INTERESTED SAILORS SHOULD SUBMIT A 1306/7 (ENLISTED PERSONNEL ACTION REQUEST), 
REQUESTING DUTY AS AN RDC TO THEIR RATING DETAILER.
IN ORDER TO REACH THE 100 PERCENT REQUIREMENT OF 601 RDCS, OPENINGS FOR APPROXIMATELY 
200 RDCS ARE ANTICIPATED EACH YEAR.  REF A CONTAINS SCREENING REQUIREMENTS AND 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPLICATION SUBMISSIONS.  SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS LISTED IN THE 
MILPERSMAN ARE WAIVERABLE, SO CONTACT YOUR DETAILER WITH SPECIFIC QUESTIONS.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND ON THE NPC WEBSITE AT WWW.PUBLIC.NAVY.MIL/BUPERS-
NPC/ENLISTED/DETAILING/SHORESPECIALPROGRAMS/PAGES/RDC.ASPX.

6.  COMMAND ACTION.  ALL COMMANDS WITH INTERESTED SAILORS MUST ENSURE APPLICATIONS FOR 
PROSPECTIVE RDC CANDIDATES ARE PROPERLY SCREENED TO HELP REDUCE ATTRITION FROM RDC "C" 
SCHOOL.  THIS FISCAL YEAR, 11 PERCENT OF DISQUALIFICATION FACTORS COULD HAVE BEEN 
DISCOVERED BY THE DETACHING COMMAND DURING THE SCREENING PROCESS.
SPECIFICALLY, RDC CANDIDATES REPORTED OUTSIDE OF BCA STANDARDS OR WITH PREEXISTING 
MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT PREVENTED THOSE FROM PASSING THE RDC PFA.  COMMANDING 
OFFICERS ARE EXPECTED TO PERSONALLY EVALUATE AND CERTIFY THAT EACH RDC CANDIDATE HAS 
BEEN PROPERLY SCREENED AND CERTIFY THAT THEY BELIEVE THE CANDIDATE POSSESSES THE 
CONFIDENCE TO PERFORM IN THIS CNO PRIORITY BILLET.  RDC MANNING IS A HIGH VISIBILITY ITEM 
THAT IS DIRECTLY TIED TO FLEET READINESS.
