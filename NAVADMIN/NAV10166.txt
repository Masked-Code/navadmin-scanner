SUBJ/NAVY ETHOS//

REF/A/NAVADMIN 318/08//

RMKS/1. THE UNITED STATES NAVY ETHOS PUBLISHED IN REF A SERVES AS A 
GUIDING SET OF PRINCIPLES AND BELIEFS THAT ALL NAVY PERSONNEL - ACTIVE, 
RESERVE, CIVILIAN - SHOULD EMBRACE IN THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES, BOTH AT 
WORK AND ON LIBERTY.  NAVY ETHOS UNDERSCORES THE NAVY'S CORE VALUES OF 
HONOR, COURAGE AND COMMITMENT, WHILE STRESSING OUR PROFESSIONALISM AND 
DISCIPLINE AS MEMBERS OF A TEAM FOCUSED ON MISSION ACCOMPLISHMENT AND 
UNWAVERING IN DEDICATION TO OUR INSTITUTIONS, SHIPMATES, AND FAMILIES.

2. OUR COMMITMENT TO NAVY ETHOS HAS NOT CHANGED.  IT CONTINUES TO BE 
THE PROPER COMPASS CHECK REGARDING FUNDAMENTAL BEHAVIOR EXPECTED OF ALL 
NAVY PERSONNEL.

3. AS MEMBERS OF THE U.S. NAVY, YOU ARE THE STEWARDS OF THE HERITAGE 
AND HIGH STANDARDS REPRESENTED IN OUR ETHOS.  I ENCOURAGE EACH OF YOU 
TO RE-READ OUR ETHOS AND PERFORM A "WAKE CHECK". ENSURE YOU ARE FULLY 
PREPARED TO SUPPORT ITS SPIRIT IN BOTH YOUR ACTIONS AND WORDS.  
LEADERSHIP BY EXAMPLE IS A FOUNDATION OF OUR ETHOS.  HAVING INHERITED A 
TREMENDOUS LEGACY OF SERVICE, LEADERSHIP AND INTEGRITY, WE ARE EXPECTED 
TO EXEMPLIFY THAT LEGACY AS ROLE MODELS.

4.  VICE CHIEF SENDS.//
