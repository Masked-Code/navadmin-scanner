AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 7220.11E, NUCLEAR OFFICER INCENTIVE PAY PROGRAM.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN promulgates a revision to reference (a) and retitles 
Nuclear Officer Incentive Pay (NOIP) and Continuation Pay (COPAY) to Nuclear 
Officer Bonus and Incentive Pay (NOBIP) and Nuclear Officer Continuation 
Bonus (COBO).

2.  A revision to reference (a) includes the following along with editorial 
and format changes:
    a.  Split reference (a) into two sections based on pay authorities:  
Nuclear Officer Bonus Pays and NOIP.
    b.  Revisions to enclosure (1) of reference (a) to reflect the COBO rate 
of 35,000 dollars for unrestricted line submarine officers with less than 24 
years of service.  This bonus pay rate is for 3-year (follow-on contracts 
only), 4-year, 5-year, 6-year, and 7-year contracts.  For initial contracts, 
officers are obligated to complete a department head tour.  Eligible officers 
serving on an existing COPAY agreement may re-negotiate a replacement COBO 
contract with a period that extends to, or beyond, an existing agreement and 
should submit this request in the format of enclosure (4) of reference (a).

3.  All other bonus and incentive pays authorized by reference (a) remain 
unchanged.

4.  The point of contact for questions regarding NOBIP is LT Joshua Wingfield

whichever comes first.
