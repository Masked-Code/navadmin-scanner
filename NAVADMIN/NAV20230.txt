RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN updates reference (a) and announces the policy and 
guidance for calendar year (CY) 2020 Season Two Meritorious Advancement 
Program (MAP) for Active and Full-Time Support Sailors.  As announced in 
reference (a), due to the successful implementation of the MAP automation in 
Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) and Fleet feedback, the 
time allocated for commands to approve MAP candidates during CY-20 MAP Season 
Two is reduced from 60 to 45 days, beginning from 1 September through 15 
October 2020.

2.  MAP will account for approximately 20-percent of total advancements in 
CY-20 with roughly half of the available quotas allocated for each season.  
All unused quotas will be factored into the Navy-wide advancement exam (NWAE) 
cycle.  We are maintaining the two-season framework that aligns the MAP with 
the NWAE to emphasize the intent of MAP in selecting and rewarding the right 
Sailors.

3.  Commands are required to submit their MAP advancement through NSIPS.  
Commands without access to NSIPS should submit their meritorious 
certification letters (MCL) via e-mail to their immediate superior in command 
(ISIC) as outlined in reference (a).
The system will use authoritative data to determine eligibility.
However, commands are still required to locally validate that MAP candidates 
have successfully completed the professional military knowledge eligibility 
examination (PMK-EE) requirement prior to the first day of the MAP season in 
accordance with reference (b).

4.  MAP Quotas.  MAP quotas by unit identification code (UIC) will be posted 
on MyNavy Portal at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-
promotion/a-enlisted- advancement-resources-and-links, then select the 
*Websites* tab in the blue banner.

6.  Point of contact is MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) at (833) 330-

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
