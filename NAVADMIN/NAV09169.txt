SUBJ/PERSONNEL SECURITY INVESTIGATION ADVISORY//
POC/MR. STEVEN LONG//YC2/CNO N09N2/TEL:(202) 433-8844/
/TEL:DSN 288-8844// 
RMKS/1. DUE TO THE INCREASING NUMBER OF REQUESTS FOR MORE 
EXPENSIVE SECURITY CLEARANCES THAT ARE EXCEEDING AVAILABLE 
RESOURCES, WE MUST ALL EVALUATE THE RATE OF OUR PERSONNEL 
SECURITY INVESTIGATION (PSI) SUBMISSIONS AND REVIEW THE RISKS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF REDUCTIONS IN SUBMISSIONS.  
2. AT THIS TIME, WE ARE DIRECTING COMMANDS TO MINIMIZE ALL 
PSI INITIATIONS, VALIDATE THE NEED FOR EACH INVESTIGATION, DELAY 
INITIATION OF NON-CRITICAL INVESTIGATIONS UNTIL AFTER 30 
SEPTEMBER 2009. THE FOLLOWING ARE CONSIDERED CRITICAL, HOWEVER, 
COMMANDS MAY MAKE DECISIONS TO INITIATE AN INVESTIGATION BASED 
ON LOCAL CONDITIONS:
A. INDIVIDUALS DIRECTLY SUPPORTING OR SCHEDULED TO DEPLOY IN 
SUPPORT OF OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS.  
B. INDIVIDUALS ASSIGNED TO A HIGH-RISK PROGRAM SUCH AS PERSONNEL
RELIABILITY PROGRAM, SPECIAL INTEGRATED OPERATIONAL PLAN, SPECIAL
ACCESS PROGRAM, OR CRYPTOGRAPHY/CRYPTOGRAPHIC. ACCESS TO SENSITIVE 
COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED HIGH-RISK BASED 
ON THAT SINGLE FACTOR.
C. INDIVIDUALS ASSIGNED TO, OR TRAVERSING PARTNER AGENCY 
WORKSPACE WHERE LACKING AN UPDATED INVESTIGATION WOULD PRECLUDE 
THEM FROM ENTERING.
3. IN ALL CASES, SECURITY MUST BE PARAMOUNT. LOCAL COMMANDERS 
ARE EXPECTED TO ENSURE EACH INVESTIGATION IS REQUIRED AND IS AT THE 
CORRECT LEVEL TO SUPPORT THE CURRENT MISSION. COMMANDERS SHOULD 
UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT OF RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SUBMISSION AND 
MAKE A DECISION BASED ON THOSE RISK FACTORS.
