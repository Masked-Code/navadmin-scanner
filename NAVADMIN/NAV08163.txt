RMKS/1. REF A ANNOUNCED THE ADMIRAL STAN ARTHUR AWARDS FOR LOGISTICS 
EXCELLENCE PROGRAM FOR CY2007.  THIS AWARD RECOGNIZES MILITARY AND 
CIVILIAN LOGISTICIANS WHO EPITOMIZE EXCELLENCE IN LOGISTICS PLANNING 
AND EXECUTION.  A FLAG/SES PANEL REVIEWED CANDIDATE NOMINATIONS AND 
SELECTED THE WINNERS THAT MERIT SPECIAL RECOGNITION.  I AM PLEASED TO 
ANNOUNCE THE FOLLOWING CY2007 WINNERS:
    A.  THE CY2007 MILITARY LOGISTICIAN OF THE YEAR IS CDR STANLEY 
DOBBS, SC, USN, ASSIGNED TO STRIKE FIGHTER WING, U.S. PACIFIC FLEET,

RELENTLESS SERVICE TO THE FLEET HAVE HAD A DRAMATIC, FAR-REACHING 
IMPACT ON THE NAVAL AVIATION ENTERPRISE (NAE) AND THE F/A-18 HORNET 
COMMUNITY.  HIS DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO COMPLEX 
LOGISTICS PROBLEMS BENEFITED A HOST OF PROGRAMS.  SPECIFIC 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS INCLUDE THE PROTOTYPED USE OF DLA PRIME VENDOR CONTRACT, 
LEAN EVENTS WHICH RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED TURN- AROUND-TIME 
AND COST AVOIDANCE, AND ESTABLISHING A CONTAINER REUSE REUTILIZATION 
CENTER.  HIS EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN ACHIEVEMENT A 
$640M COST AVOIDANCE.  
    B.  THE CY2007 CIVILIAN LOGISTICIAN OF THE YEAR IS MS. ROBIN KIME, 
ASSIGNED TO PEO LITTORAL & MINE WARFARE.  MS. KIME IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

BEST ALTERNATIVE FOR ESTABLISHING THE LITTORAL COMBAT SHIP (LCS) 
MISSION PACKAGE SUPPORT FACILITY (MPSF).  THE MPSF LEVERAGED NAVSEA, 
NAVAIR, AND NAVFAC CAPABILITIES TO DELIVER OPTIMAL LIFE CYCLE PRODUCTS 
AND SERVICES.  MS. KIME'S INNOVATIVE USE OF EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE, 
EXTENSIVE COLLABORATION, AND HER SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF NAVAL SURFACE 
AND AVIATION MAINTENANCE AND LOGISTICS TECHNIQUES RESULTED IN IMPROVED 
SUPPORT ALTERNATIVES FOR THE LCS MISSION MODULES. 
    C.  THE CY2007 OPERATIONAL LOGISTICS TEAM OF THE YEAR IS THE NAVY 
LOGISTICS INTEGRATION (NLI) TEAM WHICH IS COMPRISED OF EIGHT NAVY AND 
MARINE CORPS COMMANDS.  THROUGHOUT 2007, THEIR AGGRESSIVE APPROACH 
TOWARDS INTEGRATING BEST PRACTICE LOGISTICS PROCESSES AND TECHNOLOGIES 
SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED THE READINESS OF OUR OPERATING FORCES.  
INNOVATIVE LOGISTICS PLANNING AND SUPERB EXECUTION LED TO THE ADOPTION 
OF STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES ACROSS THE SERVICES.

INCLUDING:  REDUCTION OF CLASS IX INVENTORY LEVELS AND EMBARKATION 
FOOTPRINT BY 75%, REDUCTION OF LOST SHIPMENT BY ACHIEVING A 99.8%
