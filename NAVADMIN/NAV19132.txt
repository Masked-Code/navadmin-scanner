RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN informs eligible Service Members that the Blended 
Retirement System (BRS) mid-career Continuation Pay (CP) rates for Calendar 
Year (CY) 2020 have been released.

2.  In line with reference (a), Service Members enrolled in the BRS are 
eligible to receive mid-career CP at 12 Years of Service (YOS).
Please visit MyNavy Portal (MNP) at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/pay-and-
benefits to view the CY-20 CP pay rates memorandum.

3.  Service Members who want to receive the mid-career CP are reminded that 
they must be enrolled in BRS and request CP before 12 YOS to receive CP.  The 
CP election is made via Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS), 
which can be accessed via MyNavy Portal Quick Links.  For Service Members who 
have provided NSIPS with an up-to-date email address, NSIPS will send e-mail 
notifications of CP eligibility at 11 years 6 months YOS, 11 years 9 months 
YOS and a final reminder at 11 years 11 months YOS.  Service Members who are 
unable to elect CP through NSIPS may manually elect CP through their command 
career counselor (CCC).  CP information to include details on electing CP can 
be found in references (b) and (c).

4.  For any other CP issues, Service Members should reach out to the MyNavy 
Career Center (MNCC) at 833-330-MNCC or via e-mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil.
