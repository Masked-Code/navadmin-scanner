SUBJ/MASTER CHIEF PETTY OFFICER OF THE NAVY SELECTION// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT I HAVE SELECTED
FLTCM(SS/SW) RICK D. WEST, USN, AS THE NEXT MASTER CHIEF PETTY OFFICER 
OF THE NAVY (MCPON).  HE WILL ASSUME HIS DUTIES ON 13 DECEMBER 2008.
2.  FLTCM WEST IS SINGULARLY QUALIFIED TO LEAD AS MCPON.  HE IS 
CURRENTLY SERVING AS FLEET MASTER CHIEF, U.S. FLEET FORCES COMMAND AND 
PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS FLEET MASTER CHIEF, U.S. PACIFIC FLEET.  
HE BRINGS TO THIS ASSIGNMENT 27 YEARS OF FLEET EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING 6 
TOURS AT SEA HIGHLIGHTED BY LEADERSHIP POSITIONS ABOARD SUBMARINES AND 
SURFACE SHIPS.  IN ADDITION TO HIS EXPERIENCE AS FLEET MASTER CHIEF IN 
THE PACIFIC AND ATLANTIC, HE SERVED AS CHIEF OF THE BOAT IN USS 
PORTSMOUTH (SSN 707), COMMAND MASTER CHIEF IN USS PREBLE (DDG 88) AND 
SUBMARINE SQUADRON ELEVEN, AND FORCE MASTER CHIEF, SUBMARINE FORCE U.S. 
PACIFIC FLEET.  HE IS READY FOR ALL THAT IS AHEAD.
3.  MCPON CAMPA CAN TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN HIS MANY CONTRIBUTIONS DURING 
HIS WATCH.  HIS EXTRAORDINARY LEADERSHIP, KEEN INSIGHT, AND SOUND 
JUDGMENT ENHANCED THE ROLE OF THE CHIEF PETTY OFFICER.  HE AUTHORED THE 
CHIEF PETTY OFFICER'S MISSION, VISION, GUIDING PRINCIPLES, REVITALIZED 
THE MASTER CHIEF PETTY OFFICER OF THE NAVY'S LEADERSHIP MESS, AND 
EMPOWERED FLEET, FORCE, AND COMMAND MASTER CHIEFS.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, 
HE REESTABLISHED THE DECKPLATE LEADERSHIP THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF A U.S. 
NAVY CHIEF PETTY OFFICER.  
HIS EFFORTS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE IMPACT OF NAVY SENIOR ENLISTED 
LEADERS AND, IN DOING SO, IMPROVED THE READINESS OF THE NAVY.  
4.  LIKE HER SPOUSE, DIANA CAMPA ALSO SERVED OUR NAVY WITH GREAT 
DISTINCTION.  HER INTEREST IN THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO SERVE WAS 
INSPIRING.
5.  SELECTING MCPON CAMPA'S SUCCESSOR FROM AMONG THE EXTRAORDINARY 
NOMINEES WAS CHALLENGING, BUT REWARDING.  MY SPECIAL THANKS GOES OUT TO 
EACH OF THE QUALIFIED CANDIDATES WHO VOLUNTEERED TO BE CONSIDERED FOR 
THIS IMPORTANT AND DEMANDING POSITION.  HAVING PERSONALLY REVIEWED 
THEIR EXTRAORDINARY RECORDS, AND CONDUCTED SELECTED INTERVIEWS, I KNOW 
OUR SAILORS AND THE FLEET ARE IN VERY CAPABLE HANDS.  WE ARE FORTUNATE, 
INDEED, TO HAVE SUCH LEADERSHIP IN OUR NAVY.
6.  FROM MY EARLIEST DAYS IN THE NAVY, AND THROUGHOUT MY CAREER, CHIEF 
PETTY OFFICERS HAVE SHAPED AND INFLUENCED ME.  MASTER CHIEF WEST HAS 
THE EXPERIENCE, INSIGHT, AND CONFIDENCE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ME THAT 
WHICH I NEED TO HEAR, NOT WANT TO HEAR.  HE WILL HAVE THAT DEGREE OF 
ACCESS AND TRUST.  I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH HIM IN ALL 
THAT IS AHEAD.  
7.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
