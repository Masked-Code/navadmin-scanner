RMKS/1. TRIPS IS AN ON-LINE, SURVEY-STYLE RISK-ASSESSMENT TOOL THAT 
HELPS SAILORS RECOGNIZE AND MANAGE THE RISKS THEY FACE WHILE DRIVING 
LONG DISTANCES. WHEN A RISK ASSESSMENT IS SUBMITTED, THE DESIGNATED 
SUPERVISOR RECEIVES AN EMAIL INFORMING HIM OR HER THAT THERE IS A RISK 
ASSESSMENT TO REVIEW. THIS IN TURN OFFERS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR 
ACTIVE MENTORING. TRIPS ALSO INCLUDES MISHAP SUMMARIES, TRAVEL 
DIRECTIONS AND MAPS TO THE USER?S DESTINATION, ALONG WITH THE OPTION TO 
COMPLETE AND PRINT A LEAVE REQUEST.
2. TRIPS IS A POSITIVE TOOL, BUT IT HAS LIMITATIONS, BECAUSE IT IS WEB-
BASED, BANDWIDTH IS AN ISSUE FOR SOME COMMANDS. NOW THAT IT IS 
AVAILABLE ON NAVY KNOWLEDGE ONLINE (NKO), SAILORS WHO LOG ONTO NKO CAN 
AUTOMATICALLY ACCESS TRIPS. THIS SAVES TIME AND ALLOWS SERVICE MEMBERS 
TO ACCESS TRIPS FROM THEIR HOME COMPUTER. NAVAL SAFETY CENTER (NSC) IS 
CURRENTLY WORKING ON A DISCONNECTED VERSION OF TRIPS. WHEN AVAILABLE, 
COMMANDS WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE ASSESSMENTS WITHOUT INTERNET 
CONNECTIVITY. QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE NSC?S 
POINT OF CONTACT. TECHNICAL FEEDBACK LINKS ARE ALSO LOCATED ON THE 
TRIPS WEBSITE.
3. THE NAVY'S VERSION OF TRIPS HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE AUGUST 2006. 
THERE ARE 34,253 ACTIVE ACCOUNTS WITH 26,131 ASSESSMENTS COMPLETED. NO 
SAILOR WHO HAS COMPLETED A TRIPS ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN A 
FATAL ACCIDENT. THESE NUMBERS REPRESENT A COMMITMENT TO SAFE DRIVING.
4. IN PREPARATION FOR THE UPCOMING HOLIDAY SEASON I CHALLENGE 
COMMANDERS, COMMANDING OFFICERS, AND OFFICERS-IN-CHARGE TO CREATIVELY 
INCREASE AWARENESS AND USE OF THIS READILY AVAILABLE AND VITAL TOOL. 
TRIPS IS A GREAT WAY TO HELP REDUCE PERSONAL MOTOR VEHICLE MISHAPS.

OPERATIONS.//
