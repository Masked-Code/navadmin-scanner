3.  The commanding officer (CO), the Secretary of the Navy, or his designee, 
has the authority to delay projected promotions.  Upon the exercise of a

the promotion and not be tendered the promoting appointment.  The delay 
authority will immediately forward the notification of delay with supporting 
documentation to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-83), copy to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806).

4.  COs are reminded of their responsibility to ensure the officers they are 
promoting are mentally, physically, morally and professionally qualified in 
accordance with title 10, U.S. Code 624.
Per reference (a), officers are ineligible for promotion if they have failed 
the most recent Physical Fitness Assessment.  COs shall verify the promoting 
officers information in the Physical Readiness Information Management System 
to ensure compliance with reference (a), as modified by reference (b), and 
delay the officers promotion in accordance with paragraph 3 of this NAVADMIN, 
if required.

5.  Prepare a Delivery of Permanent Appointment (NAVPERS form
