HOWEVER, PER PARAGRAPH 203.B OF REF A, SELECTION BOARD ELIGIBLE PERSONNEL MUST 
HAVE COMPLETED THE CONVERSION PROCESS AND BE IN THEIR NEW RATING ONE MONTH 
PRIOR TO BOARD CONVENING IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A QQQQ REVIEW BY THE SELECTION

MUST BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH REF A, PARA 216.F.

BOARD.  THE "EARLY PROMOTE" EVALUATIONS ON WHICH THE TIR WAIVER IS BASED MUST

INELIGIBLE FOR ADVANCEMENT.  THESE SAILORS SHOULD NOT BE ADMINISTERED THE 
EXAM, OR IF RESULTS OCCUR AFTER EXAM ADMINISTRATION, THE EXAM MUST BE 
INVALIDATED BY THEIR COMMANDS.
