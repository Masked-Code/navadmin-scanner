RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and allows for alternate 
pathways for the mobilization processing of Sailors in the Ready Reserve 
ordered to Active Duty pursuant to reference (b) and for Sailors on Active 
Duty preparing to deploy individually in support of overseas 
contingencies.  Adaptive mobilization (AM) is the use of mobilization 
pathways tailored to the mission requirements of the ultimate duty 
station.  This NAVADMIN establishes AM, provides exceptions to policies that 
require mobilizing Sailors to process through Navy mobilization processing 
sites commanded by the Expeditionary Combat Readiness Center (EXPCBTREDCEN) 
per reference (c), designates Commander, Navy Reserve Force (COMNAVRESFOR) as 
the Navy supported commander for Ready Reserve activation and deactivation 
and directs the command and control transfer of EXPCBTREDCEN to Commander, 
Navy Reserve Forces Command (COMNAVRESFORCOM). 
 
 
2.  AM enables the Navy to respond with speed and quantity of personnel in 
support of a large-scale contingency.  The AM construct applies to both 
Active and Reserve Sailors ordered to serve in individual augmentee (IA) 
assignments and establishes a mobilization to billet pathway (MOB-to-billet) 
for Selected Reserve (SELRES) Sailors.  MOB-to-billet is the activation 
(other than for training) of SELRES Sailors to serve in the authorized and 
funded manpower billet at the command to which they are permanently 
assigned.  The establishment of MOB-to-billet processing pathways aligns with 
reference (d) to develop a seasoned team of Naval warriors by using the Navy 
Reserve Component in critical roles at sea and ashore rather than as IAs. 
 
3.  COMNAVRESFOR is designated as the supported commander for Ready Reserve 
activation and deactivation processing.  This key policy change leverages 
COMNAVRESFORs nationally distributed infrastructure of Navy Reserve 
Activities to activate SELRES personnel and minimizes the interim stops that 
Sailors are required to make between their home of record and their ultimate 
duty station during MOB-to-billet and Navy IA mobilizations. 
 
4.  COMNAVRESFOR shall 
    a.  Coordinate with the Chief of Naval Personnel (OPNAV N1), Chief of 
Navy Reserve (OPNAV N095), Navy Personnel Command and U.S. Fleet Forces 
Command (COMUSFLTFORCOM) to update policies and refine procedures necessary 
to perform activation and deactivation processing for the Ready Reserve. 
    b.  Provide assessments and recommendations to OPNAV N095 and OPNAV N1 to 
improve activation and deactivation policies, processes and procedures that 
will enable an effective mass mobilization capability for the Navy.  The Navy 
will establish the capability to activate 50,000 SELRES personnel within 30 
days in order to provide Fleet and Joint commanders the predictability 
necessary for effective operational planning. 
 
5.  Command and control of EXPCBTREDCEN shall transfer from Commander, Navy 
Expeditionary Combat Command (COMNECC) to COMNAVRESFORCOM to align personnel 
mobilization support functions under one Navy commander.  Authority and 
responsibility of type commander (TYCOM) and local area coordinator for 
mobilizations (LACMOB) delineated in reference (c) shall transfer from 
COMNECC to COMNAVRESFORCOM.  Command, TYCOM and LACMOB authorities transfer 
consistent with references (e) and (f).  Control functions will transfer in a 
conditions-based phased process throughout Fiscal Year 2022, concluding on or 
about 1 October 2022.  Commands that have officially been delegated LACMOB 
authority shall retain this authority until superseded or cancelled. 
 
6.  Per reference (g), COMUSFLTFORCOM shall maintain roles and 
responsibilities as U.S. Navy global force manager and will continue 
to serve as CNOs designated executive agent for IA. 
 
7.  Reference (c) will be revised and updated to reflect these policy 
changes.  COMNAVRESFOR and COMUSFLTFORCOM may provide interim guidance that 
deviates from reference (c) according to their roles and responsibilities 
established with this message.
