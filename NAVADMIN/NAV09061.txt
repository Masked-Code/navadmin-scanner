SUBJ/ALCOHOL ABUSE PREVENTION//
RMKS/1.  OVER THE PAST DECADE WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN 
ADDRESSING AND PREVENTING ALCOHOL ABUSE.  THE "RIGHT SPIRIT" CAMPAIGN 
HAS BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL, AS EVIDENCED BY A 33 PERCENT 
REDUCTION IN ALCOHOL RELATED INCIDENTS AND A 23 PERCENT REDUCTION IN 
DUI/DWI INCIDENTS FOR THE NAVY SINCE FY-04.   
2.  IT IS NOW TIME TO REFOCUS OUR EFFORTS AND REINFORCE OUR NAVY-
WIDE CULTURE OF INTOLERANCE OF ALCOHOL ABUSE.  EVEN WITH THE  DECREASE 
IN ALCOHOL RELATED INCIDENTS, ALCOHOL IS STILL THE COMMON  FACTOR IN 
MANY DISCIPLINARY PROBLEMS AND OFTEN CONTRIBUTES TO THE  COMMISSION OF 
VIOLENT CRIMES, SEXUAL ASSAULTS, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AND SAILOR-ON-
SAILOR CRIMES.  IN A RECENT SURVEY ON NAVY ALCOHOL ABUSE, 33 PERCENT OF 
ENLISTED AND 24 PERCENT OF OFFICERS ADMITTED  TO DRIVING AN AUTOMOBILE 
AFTER DRINKING TOO MUCH AND 22 PERCENT OF  RESPONDENTS ADMITTED TO 
UNDERAGE DRINKING.  BOTH OF THESE BEHAVIORS  ARE PREVENTABLE AND 
UNACCEPTABLE.  ALL HANDS MUST UNDERSTAND THAT ALCOHOL ABUSE WILL NOT BE 
TOLERATED IN THE NAVY.    
3.  TODAY'S NAVY REQUIRES 100 PERCENT OF EVERY SAILOR'S MENTAL AND  
PHYSICAL ABILITIES.  WHILE THE NUMBER OF SAILORS INCURRING ALCOHOL- 
RELATED INCIDENTS IS LOW, THE IMPACT IS SIGNIFICANT.  ALCOHOL IS NEVER 
AN EXCUSE FOR IRRESPONSIBLE OR ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR.  THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO 
ACT IRRESPONSIBLY DUE TO ALCOHOL ABUSE WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR 
THEIR ACTIONS.  WE CANNOT AFFORD TO IGNORE ALCOHOL ABUSE AT OUR 
COMMANDS OR BY OUR SHIPMATES.  WHEN WE SEE THE WARNING SIGNS THAT A 
SHIPMATE IS HAVING PROBLEMS, WE OWE IT TO OUR SAILORS AND THE NAVY TO 
TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF INTERVENING.    
4.  WE MUST FOSTER A COMMAND CLIMATE WHICH MOTIVATES EVERYONE TO 
CONDUCT THEMSELVES AS PROFESSIONALS AND ENCOURAGES THOSE WITH ALCOHOL 
PROBLEMS TO SEEK HELP IN ORDER TO PREVENT ALCOHOL ABUSE. EACH OF US 
MUST CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE FOLLOWING "RIGHT SPIRIT" CAMPAIGN 
PRINCIPLES:  LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBILITY, COMMAND RESPONSIBILITY, 
SHIPMATE RESPONSIBILITY, AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.  MANY COMMANDS 
HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY REDUCING ALCOHOL ABUSE BY DEGLAMORIZING ALCOHOL, 
USING PAY GRADE SPECIFIC FOCUS GROUPS TO PROMOTE RESPONSIBILITY, 
ASSIGNING RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMAND RIGHT SPIRIT INITIATIVES, AND 
MAKING ALCOHOL ABUSE PREVENTION AN "ALL-HANDS" EFFORT.  EACH OF YOU ARE 
PART OF THE SOLUTION IN COMBATTING NAVY ALCOHOL ABUSE.  WATCH OUT FOR 
YOUR SHIPMATES, AND ACT RESPONSIBLY AT ALL TIMES.   
5.  FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE ALCOHOL ABUSE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS 
AVAILABLE ONLINE AT WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/COMMANDSUPPORT/NADAP.  THE NAVY'S 
"RIGHT SPIRIT" CAMPAIGN RESOURCES OR ASSISTANCE TO AID THOSE WITH 
ALCOHOL PROBLEMS CAN BE OBTAINED BY CONTACTING SHCM(SW) ROXAS AT (901)
