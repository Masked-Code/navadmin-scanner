SUBJ/EVERY SAILOR IS A RECRUITER COMMANDING OFFICERS RESOURCES//

RMKS/1.  The purpose of this NAVADMIN is to provide additional information 
and resources, via the Every Sailor is a Recruiter
(EsaR) Commanding Officers (CO) Smartbook and the Navy recruiting E- toolbox 
website, to all Navy commands.  Commander, Navy Recruiting Command (CNRC) is 
asking all Navy commands to help fill the ranks by sharing their Navy story 
and to find, coach, and mentor at least one quality recruit candidate this 
Fiscal Year (FY).

2.  The ESaR program aims to involve every Navy command in the active effort 
to identify applicants who are interested in Naval Service.  The ESaR COs 
Smartbook serves as a guide for commands to use in establishing programs that 
can assist this effort.  The overall objective is to enhance the Navy's 
recruitment process by engaging individual commands and their personnel in 
the pursuit of quality recruits.

3.  The ESaR COs Smartbook provides a comprehensive array of recruiting 
resources including:  Community events, media outreach programs, delayed 
entry programs, what to expect at Recruit Training Command (RTC), RTC's 
physical readiness program, Warrior Toughness program, military pay 
information, Navy Reserve benefits, educational information, and other useful 
links.

4.  The ESaR E-toolbox website provides a dashboard for commands to track 
referral and contract efforts has a link to the referral submission website 
and provides promotional materials and videos that can be shared with 
applicants in order to assist commands in sharing our Navy's mission.

5.  The ESaR program recognizes successful recruitment efforts through the 
authorization of Flag Letters of Commendation (FLOC).
CNRC has authorized a FLOC (max of 2) for any Sailor who provides a referral 
that ultimately leads to a future Sailor contract.  FLOCs are worth one point 
each towards advancement and can make a difference when final multiple scores 
are calculated.

6.  Additional Information:  To download the COs Smartbook, and for 
additional resources:
