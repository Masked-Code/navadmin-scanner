RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN is the third in a series of NAVADMINs providing 
updates on the NMCI Secret Internet Protocol Routing Network (SIPRNet) and 
Non-Classified Internet Protocol Routing Network (NIPRNet) enterprise 
migration to WIN10 SHB due to complete by 30 June 2018.  Migration to WIN10 
SHB is necessary to improve Cybersecurity, promote standardization across the 
Naval Enterprise Network, and comply with the DoD mandates.  This message 
outlines current status, efforts to resolve challenges, and timelines for 
resolution.  Specific responsibilities required to ensure completion of the 
transition to the WIN10 SHB for all NMCI seats by 30 June
2018 are addressed below.  It also provides an updated plan for SIPRNet 
rollout in spaces that are not approved for 24-7 Open Storage Secret.

2.  The NMCI enterprise migration to WIN10 SHB is continuing with the NIPRNet 
migration status at 70 percent complete and the SIPRNet migration at 37 
percent complete.  The biggest migration challenges seen-to-date are:
    a.  The NMCI Service Desk is experiencing much higher than expected call 
volume which has resulted in a significant Service Desk backlog (this 
includes email, enterprise self-service, and
voicemail) and has impacted resolution times for users.  For expectation 
management, the average time to resolve a trouble ticket is currently at 
seven days.  This is due to numerous issues with the
WIN10 upgrade and other large scale software updates.
    b.  NIPRNet machines physically disconnected from the network at the time 
of a scheduled In Place Upgrade (IPU) and not being upgraded on time.  Seats 
that are not physically connected to the NMCI enterprise at the time of 
upgrade are being reported daily to the commands CIO and Contract Technical 
Representatives (CTR).
    c.  Configuration management and standardization.  Each make, model, and 
variant of computer, among other unique factors, requires its own solution to 
be designed and implemented.  The identification and documenting of these 
unique configurations is being compiled and issues are being resolved as 
quickly as possible.

3.  The Service Desk is working issues in the order in which they are 
reported and prioritizes users whose machines are completely inoperable to 
resolve first.  Manpower has been increased by the contractor so trouble 
tickets can be cleared more quickly.

4.  Command CIOs and CTRs will aggressively track the scheduled upgrades for 
their commands and ensure planned seat migrations execute as scheduled.  
Detailed scheduling and reporting capabilities are available to the CTRs.  
Users receiving the IPU push must leave seats connected for five days before 
and during the upgrade.  Stress to users the importance of maintaining the 
scheduled migration dates for each seat and provide each user with 
information about their
WIN10 migration method and their scheduled upgrade date.  Remind users of 
reference (d), direction regarding end of day actions.
Users still on Windows 7 - select "Restart" vice Shutdown, and select No when 
prompted for Green Shutdown.  This allows the computer to receive software 
patches and perform standard maintenance in preparation for WIN10 migration.
    a.  The program office has established daily Wipe and Reimage (W
&R) coordination and collaboration meetings with all Field service locations, 
command CTRs, and program office leadership.  Domain level meetings are held 
daily except Wednesdays.  East Coast domain is at 1300 EDT and West Coast 
domain is at 1600 EDT.  On Wednesdays there is an Enterprise wide 
coordination call that is held at 1500 EDT.  Dial in information for each 
call is:
       (1) East Domain call is: 571-508-0000 (PIN 431238)
       (2) West Domain call is: 571-508-0000 (PIN 443450)
       (3) Enterprise call is: 571-508-0000 (PIN 832349)
    b.  For seats that are not online during their scheduled IPU push, the 
upgrade will start as soon as the computer is reconnected.  Users should plan 
to be without that computer for 24 hours and to use another computer on the 
network.

5.  Individual User Responsibilities:
    a.  Consult with your CTR to know when your computer is scheduled for 
technical refresh, W&R or to receive the IPU.  Your NIPRNet computer must 
remain plugged in via cable to the network and powered on for five days prior 
to your upgrade date.  Disable the power saver feature so the computer 
remains powered on.
    b.  Plan to be without your computer for 24 hours on your scheduled date.  
This will not affect your ability to log in to other computers and to access 
your data on the NMCI shared drives.  If you submit a trouble ticket, with 
current call volume it is expected to be cleared within seven days.
    c.  Backup data on your computer to a shared drive or external hard drive 
(if you have one) so that you can retrieve your data after your migration.  
Contact your IT Support staff for alternate backup methods if your data 
backup requirements exceed your share drive capacity.

6.  SIPRNet Migration to WIN10 is under way via Technical Refresh and W&R.  
The SIPRNet IPU process will begin 1 June.  Detailed planning, by machine 
name, is in progress to account for all of the different connection methods 
in the SIPRNet environment.

7.  Any computer that has not migrated on schedule will be quarantined and 
not allowed on the network until the upgrade is complete.  The quarantined 
seat will have no access to network resources (email, share drive, internet).  
Users of quarantined computers can use another computer to access their 
information and should contact the command CTR or IT Support staff to have 
their computer migrated to WIN10.
