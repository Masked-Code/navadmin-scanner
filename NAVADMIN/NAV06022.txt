SUBJ/FY-06 EARLY TRANSITION PROGRAM//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  CONTINUED HIGH REENLISTMENT RATES, LOW
ATTRITION, AND SUCCESSFUL RECRUITING EFFORTS ENABLE EXTENSION OF
EARLY SEPARATION OPPORTUNITIES TO SAILORS WHO MEET CERTAIN
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS.  PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO

RESERVE FOR THOSE QUALIFIED SAILORS WHO HAVE DECIDED TO TRANSITION
FROM THE ACTIVE COMPONENT.

COMMANDS RECOMMENDING APPROVAL OF EARLY SEPARATION SHOULD NOT EXPECT
A RELIEF UNTIL THE SAILOR'S ORIGINAL EAOS OR PROJECTED ROTATION
DATE, WHICHEVER IS EARLIER.  CONTACT APPROPRIATE RATING DETAILER TO
DETERMINE RELIEF AVAILABILITY.
