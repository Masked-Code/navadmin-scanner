SUBJ/CNO DIVERSITY POLICY// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES MY RECENTLY ISSUED NAVY 
DIVERSITY POLICY.
2.  AS STATED IN THE VISION OF MY GUIDANCE FOR 2007-2008, THE UNITED 
STATES NAVY WILL REMAIN A SUPERBLY TRAINED AND LED TEAM OF DIVERSE 
SAILORS AND CIVILIANS.  TO REALIZE THIS VISION, OUR NAVY MUST EMBRACE 
AND TAP INTO THE UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES AND HARNESS THE ENORMOUS TALENTS 
OF OUR NATION?S DIVERSE POPULATION SO THAT WE REMAIN RELEVANT, 
EFFECTIVE, AND GARNER THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE ENTIRE NATION.  TO 
FURTHER ELABORATE, MY DIVERSITY POLICY IS QUOTED HERE IN ITS ENTIRETY.
3.  (QUOTE) DIVERSITY HAS MADE OUR NATION AND NAVY STRONGER.  TO DERIVE 
THE MOST FROM THAT DIVERSITY, EVERY INDIVIDUAL, MILITARY OR CIVILIAN, 
MUST BE ENCOURAGED AND ENABLED TO REACH HIS OR HER FULL POTENTIAL.  
THEY MUST BE INSPIRED, AND EMPOWERED TO ATTAIN THE MOST SENIOR LEVELS 
OF LEADERSHIP.  THAT EMPOWERMENT TODAY IS UNLEASHED BY INVOLVED, 
THOUGHTFUL, PROACTIVE, AND ENLIGHTENED LEADERS.  AS LEADERS, WE ARE ALL 
ENTRUSTED WITH THE DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO SET AND LIVE THE EXAMPLE 
BY CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE EVERY INDIVIDUAL?S CONTRIBUTION IS 
VALUED AND RESPECTED.  FUTURE EMPOWERMENT IS CULTIVATED BY THAT SAME 
LEADERSHIP, MENTORSHIP, AND AN ACTIVE COMMITMENT TO ATTRACTING AND 
RECRUITING THE VERY BEST.  WE WILL FOSTER AN ENVIRONMENT THAT RESPECTS 
THE INDIVIDUAL?S WORTH BASED ON HIS OR HER PERFORMANCE REGARDLESS OF 
RACE, GENDER, OR CREED.
AS CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS, I WILL LEAD DIVERSITY INITIATIVES IN THE 
NAVY.  I CHALLENGE ALL WHO SERVE TO DO THE SAME THROUGH LEADERSHIP, 
MENTORSHIP, SERVICE, AND EXAMPLE.  OUR INVOLVED, PROACTIVE LEADERSHIP 
WILL CREATE, AND ENABLE AN ENVIRONMENT, AND A TOTAL WORKFORCE THAT 
VALUES UNIQUENESS, DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, AND TALENT.  WORKFORCE 
CHARACTER AND PROFESSIONALISM IS A PRIORITY IN OUR NAVY.  ACCORDINGLY, 
WE WILL SUPPORT A CULTURE OF PROFESSIONAL, AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT 
ENSURING OUR PEOPLE ARE TRAINED AND EDUCATED TO ACCOMPLISH OUR MISSION, 
WITH OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO ALL IN AN EQUAL MANNER.
WE MUST NOT BE LOCKED IN TIME.  AS LEADERS, WE MUST ANTICIPATE, AND 
EMBRACE THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES OF TOMORROW, AND BUILD A NAVY THAT 
ALWAYS REFLECTS OUR COUNTRY?S MAKE UP.  WE MUST LEAD IN WAYS THAT WILL 
CONTINUE TO DRAW MEN AND WOMEN TO SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY AND TO OUR 
NAVY.  DIVERSITY OF THOUGHTS, IDEAS, COMPETENCIES OF OUR PEOPLE, KEEPS 
OUR NAVY STRONG, AND EMPOWERS THE PROTECTION OF THE VERY FREEDOMS AND 
OPPORTUNIES WE ENJOY EACH AND EVERY DAY.  THE VAST TALENT, DIVERSITY, 
AND EXPERIENCE OF OUR CITIZENS WILL CONTINUE TO BE OUR STRENGTH, AND 
WILL ENSURE OUR NAVY?S RELEVANCE AND OUR NATION?S SECURITY AND 
PROSPERITY.
AS WE ENHANCE AND EMPOWER OUR DIVERSITY, WE WILL REMAIN A GLOBAL FORCE 
FOR PEACE, AND EPITOMIZE THE IDEALS THAT MAKE OUR NAVY GREAT AND OUR 
NATION THE BEST HOPE OF FREEDOM.  WE WILL SUSTAIN OUR FORCE THROUGH THE 
FAIR, EQUAL, AND ETHICAL TREATMENT OF EVERY MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES 
NAVY.  
//S// G. ROUGHEAD, ADMIRAL, U.S. NAVY, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.
(QUOTE) 4.  ALL MUST READ AND UNDERSTAND OUR NAVY?S DIVERSITY POLICY 
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY TO THE STRENGTH OF OUR NAVY AND NATION.
EVERY SAILOR AND CIVILIAN EMPLOYEE IS A RECRUITER.  WE MUST TAKE EVERY 
OPPORTUNITY TO ATTRACT DIVERSE TALENT WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE PUBLIC.
WE MUST ALSO CONTINUE TO FOSTER A CULTURE OF PROFESSIONAL GROWTH IN OUR 
DIVERSE NAVY.  THIS POLICY IS NOT ABOUT WORDS ON PAPER, BUT ABOUT 
MATCHING POSITIVE ACTIONS TO THE WORDS.  IN THE END, THESE ACTIONS WILL 
ENSURE OUR NAVY?S COMBAT CAPABILITY ENDURES LONG INTO THE FUTURE.
