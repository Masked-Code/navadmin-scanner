RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces solicitation of applications from highly 
qualified and motivated E-6 through E-9 active duty and full- time support 
personnel for the FY-20 Limited Duty Officer (LDO) and Chief Warrant Officer 
(CWO) Programs.  Where conflicts with reference (a) exist, this NAVADMIN 
takes precedence.

2.  Nuclear LDO program applicants refer to reference (b).

3.  For the most current information concerning open designator codes, visit 
the LDO/CWO Community Manager website at http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/communitymanagers/active/ldo_cwo/Pages/References.aspx
and click on the LDO and CWO designators link.

4.  LDOs and CWOs bring a variety of experience and unique perspectives into 
the wardroom from their enlisted service.  The LDO/CWO career paths provide 
additional leadership opportunities and enhance the ability of a Sailor to 
contribute to the Navy.  These programs deliver the officer corps seasoned 
professionals with proven leadership abilities at an economical cost.  LDOs 
provide broad technical management and leadership skills, and CWOs provide 
specific technical expertise and leadership skills in support of the 
unrestricted line, restricted line, and staff corps communities.
LDOs and CWOs serve in a variety of leadership billets within their technical 
fields, ranging from division officer to commanding officer (CO) ashore.

5.  Updated policy guidance to reference (a).
    a.  All time in service (TIS) and time in grade (TIG) requirements for 
the FY-20 board shall be computed to
1 October 2019.
    b.  To support career progression models and maximize the return on 
investment for the Navy, TIS waivers for LDO and CWO applications will not be 
considered.
    c.  Applicants are not required to include an obligatory service 
statement to remain on active duty as part of their personal statement.  This 
requirement is included as part of the appointment documentation signed upon 
commissioning.
        (1) LDO obligatory service is 4 years from commissioning.
LDOs must serve 10 years commissioned service to retire as an officer.
        (2) CWO obligatory service is 6 years from commissioning.
    d.  TIS and TIG requirements are:
        (1) LDO:  8-14 years TIS and 1 year TIG for E6 and above.
Applicants for off-ramp designators (651X, 681X, and 682X) may apply up to 15 
years TIS.
        (2) CWO2:  14-20 years TIS for E6 selected for E7, E7, and

convening date.

on a case by case basis.  All applicants must meet additional eligibility 
requirements for off-ramp outlined in reference (c).  In line with reference 
(a), CWO applicants for LDO do not require interview appraisals.
    e.  The FY-20 In-Service Procurement Board (ISPB) will consider Navy 
Divers (ND) for the 623X Submarine Engineer designator.
    f.  ND applicants applying for designator 720X shall possess the master 
diver Navy enlisted classification (NEC MMDV) or be a chief or senior chief 
petty officer first class diver (NEC M1DV) who meets all eligibility 
requirements to attend master diver evaluation course in reference (d), 
subparagraph 18b(5)(a) through 18b(5)(i), with the following exceptions:

        (2) Subparagraph 18b(5)(h):  Successfully passed the written master

    g.  Applicants applying for cyber chief warrant officer (784X) will refer

    h.  Intelligence CWO applicants must have earned the Enlisted Information 
Warfare Specialist (EIWS) qualification and possess the 3910/K10A (Imagery

consideration for 783X.  The technical experience of the applicant will be 
weighted greater than non-technical experience.
    i.  CO/officer in charge (OIC) endorsement, located on page 10 of OPNAV 
1420/1 (Rev 01-08), must contain the following statement:
*Applicant meets all requirements outlined in OPNAVINST 1420.1B, NAVADMIN

standards of OPNAVINST 6110.1J.*

6.  First class petty officers serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Horn of 
Africa determined to be chief petty officer board eligible in line with 
reference (g) are also eligible for LDO if all other eligibility requirements 
are met.

7.  Interview appraisal boards shall be constructed and approved by the 
CO/OIC and consist of three naval officers (LDO/CWOs preferred).
The senior member of the interview panel should be a lieutenant commander or 
above.  Every effort (including teleconference media) shall be made to ensure 
at least one board member is from the designator for which the applicant is 
applying.  Minimum grade requirements for board members are LT or CWO3.  
Three interview appraisals must be submitted for each applicant.  The 
Potential block on interview appraisals must be marked for LDO/CWO 
candidates.
Only the current version of the Interviewer Appraisal Sheet, located at 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/administrative/ldo_cwo/Pages/default.aspx will be accepted.

8.  Applicants who have or are currently serving in an individual 
augmentation manpower management (IAMM), global support assignment (GSA), or 
overseas contingency operations support assignment (OSA) are to include these 
tours in the assignment history section of the application.  CO/OIC 
recommendation must include validation of any listed IA/GSA assignment.

9.  Applicants currently serving in an IAMM, GSA, or OSA assignment may have 
their application endorsed by the field commander.  All applications endorsed 
by field commanders must have parent command concurrence.  A sample format is

are included in the application or provided via addendum for board review and 
continuity.  First class petty officers must submit the 15 November 2018 
evaluation via an addendum if it is not already reflected in the official 
military personnel file.

11.  Due to ongoing rating mergers or realignments, eligible Sailors are 
encouraged to apply for the designator for which they have extensive 
documented technical and leadership experience in their enlisted service 
records, regardless of current rating.  However, special attention should be 
given to the guidance in chapter 7, subparagraph 9c of reference (a).

12.  Applicants must maintain eligibility throughout the selection and 
promotion process.  Applicants who are deemed ineligible after submitting an 
application must be declared ineligible by their current CO/OIC.  A sample 
format is located at http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/administrative/ldo_cwo/Pages/default.aspx (See Sample Letter of 
Abeyance or Removal of Recommendation).

13.  Each applicant and command must ensure applications are complete and 
accurate.  Incomplete applications could result in non- selection.  Refer to 
reference (a), (chapters 2, 7 and appendix f) for security clearance 
information, program overview, eligibility criteria, and application format.
