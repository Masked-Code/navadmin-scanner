RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits applications and provides guidance for the 
Fiscal Year 2020 (FY-20) Enlisted to Medical Degree Preparatory Program 
(EMDP2).

2.  The EMDP2 is a 2 year undergraduate education program open to Sailors of 
all ratings who meet eligibility requirements in line with reference (a).  
The EMDP2 is a partnership between the Uniformed Services University of the 
Health Sciences (USUHS) and the Military Services to provide an opportunity 
for highly motivated, academically promising enlisted Service Members.  The 
EMDP2 consists of intensive coursework, preparation and mentoring to prepare 
students for application to medical school.  Upon completion of the program, 
successful students will be competitive for acceptance to U.S. medical 
schools.

3.  Selectees are assigned to the USUHS in Bethesda, MD for a 2 year period.  
Individuals selected for the EMDP2 program will remain on active-duty while 
completing coursework and will receive pay, allowances, benefits and 
privileges of their current paygrade.
Selectees will receive permanent change of station orders to USUHS for the 
entire length of the course.  All school expenses (i.e., books, tuition, 
labs, etc.) will be paid by USUHS for the entire length of the course.

4.  Deadline for submission of applications for FY-20 enrollment is
1 November 2019.  Application packages must be postmarked on or before the 
deadline date.  No additional documents or packages will be accepted after 
this date.  The selection board will convene in December 2019.  All 
application requirements are specified in reference (a).

5.  Strict adherence to package submission requirements will be a primary 
factor for selection.  Applicants must review their package in its entirety 
before submitting.  A minimum score of good on the latest physical fitness 
assessment and qualifying Scholastic Assessment Test/American College Test 
scores are required.

6.  This NAVADMIN does not modify any previous guidance contained in 
reference (a) regarding selective reenlistment bonus.

7.  Applicants assigned to a nuclear training command or who hold a nuclear 
Navy enlisted classification (N13O, N13S, N14O, N14S, N15O, N15S, N16O, N16S,

to the Nuclear Propulsion Program Manager (OPNAV
