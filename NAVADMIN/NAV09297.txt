NARR/REF A IS OPNAV INSTRUCTION 6100.3, DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT 
(DHA) PROCESS.  REF B IS NAVADMIN 099/09, INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION (IA) 
GRAM NUMBER FIVE ? ASSIGNMENT OF COMMAND INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE 
COORDINATOR (CIAC).//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES POST DEPLOYMENT HEALTH RE-ASSESSMENT 
(PDHRA) UPDATES AND GUIDANCE ON THE DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT (DHA) 
PROGRAM.  REF A REQUIRES THAT NAVY COMMANDS AND MEDICAL PROVIDERS 
ENSURE SAILORS ARE SCREENED FOR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS 
BEFORE AND AFTER CERTAIN DEPLOYMENTS.  IN ADDITION TO THE PDHA AND 
PDHRA (DD2796 AND DD2900), EMPHASIS MUST ALSO BE PLACED ON THE PRE-
DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ASSESSMENT (DD2795) TO ENSURE WE ARE SENDING 
PHYSICALLY QUALIFIED SAILORS FORWARD.

2.  THE NAVY HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN IMPROVING COMPLIANCE WITH THE 
PDHRA REQUIREMENT; HOWEVER, APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT OF OUR PERSONNEL 
REMAIN OUT OF COMPLIANCE.  ADDITIONAL EFFORT IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT 
DEPLOYERS RECEIVE THE NECESSARY SCREENINGS TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE STRESS 
INJURIES AND OTHER HEALTH CONCERNS THAT MAY REQUIRE FURTHER ASSESSMENT 
OR TREATMENT.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO HELP 
COMMANDS ADDRESS PDHRA (DD2900) REQUIREMENTS INDICATED BY THE MEDICAL 
READINESS REPORTING SYSTEM (MRRS) ? THE COMMANDER?S TOOL TO MONITOR DHA 
COMPLIANCE.

3.  THE FOLLOWING ARE STEPS COMMANDING OFFICERS SHOULD TAKE TO COMPLETE 
THE PDHRA PROCESS:
    A.  GENERATE A DETAILED DEPLOYMENT REPORT (BY UIC) FROM MRRS.  THIS 
SHOULD BE DONE AT LEAST MONTHLY FOR MONITORING PURPOSES.  IT IS 
POSSIBLE THAT MRRS MAY NOT IDENTIFY ALL PERSONNEL REQUIRING A PDHRA.  
IT IS THE COMMAND?S RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW THE DEPLOYMENT HISTORIES OF 
THEIR SAILORS AND ENSURE ALL REQUIREMENTS ARE MET.  PERSONNEL 
IDENTIFIED IN MRRS AS DUE OR OVERDUE FOR A PDHRA SHOULD BE CONTACTED TO 
VERIFY THAT THEY SPENT MORE THAN 30 CONSECUTIVE DAYS ASHORE IN AN 
OCONUS LOCATION WITHOUT A FIXED MILITARY TREATMENT FACILITY (MTF).  IF 
SO, THESE SAILORS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A PDHRA.
    B.  COMMANDING OFFICERS SHALL ALSO ENSURE:
        (1) EACH SAILOR WITH A VERIFIED PDHRA REQUIREMENT FIRST SUBMITS 
A PDHRA DD2900 SURVEY ON-LINE USING THE ELECTRONIC DEPLOYMENT HEALTH 
ASSESSMENT (EDHA) WEB APPLICATION AT 
HTTPS://DATA.NMCPHC.MED.NAVY.MIL/EDHA.  NOTE:  PASSWORDS FOR THE EDHA 
WEBSITE MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE COMMAND DHA COMPLIANCE COORDINATOR.
        (2) EACH SAILOR THEN SCHEDULES AN APPOINTMENT WITH A RESERVE 
HEALTH READINESS PROGRAM (RHRP) CONTRACTOR OR OTHER APPROVED DOD 
MEDICAL ORGANIZATION TO COMPLETE THE ASSESSMENT.  A PDHRA IS CONSIDERED 
COMPLETE ONLY AFTER A MEDICAL PROVIDER HAS INTERVIEWED THE MEMBER AND 
CERTIFIED THE ASSESSMENT.
        (3) SAILORS WITHOUT AN MTF, RHRP CONTRACTOR, OR OTHER APPROVED 
DOD MEDICAL ORGANIZATION NEAR THEIR HOME OR DUTY STATION WILL FIRST 
SUBMIT THEIR PDHRA (DD2900) SURVEY ON-LINE.  ONCE SUBMITTED ON-LINE, 
ENSURE THE SAILOR CALLS THE PDHRA CALL CENTER AT 1-888-734-7299 (OPTION 
#3) TO COMPLETE THE ASSESSMENT OVER THE PHONE WITH A MEDICAL PROVIDER 
FOR CERTIFICATION.  THE PDHRA CALL CENTER OPTION IS AVAILABLE TO 
RESERVE COMPONENT AND ACTIVE COMPONENT SAILORS IN REMOTE LOCATIONS 
WITHOUT AN MTF.
        (4) SERVICE MEMBERS RECEIVE APPROPRIATE FOLLOW-UP FOR 
IDENTIFIED CONCERNS IN COORDINATION WITH MEDICAL PROVIDERS.
    C.  IF DETERMINED, BASED ON DHA CRITERIA, THAT A SAILOR IS 
INCORRECTLY LISTED IN MRRS AS ?DUE? OR ?OVERDUE,? A LOCAL MEDICAL 
DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVE SHALL OPEN THE SAILOR?S MRRS RECORD, ACCESS 
THE DEPLOY TAB LISTING THE SAILOR?S DEPLOYMENT HISTORY, AND EXCLUDE THE 
EVENT THAT IS TRIGGERING THE PDHRA REQUIREMENT.  THE PROCESS IS AS 
FOLLOWS:
        (1) IF A PDHA (DD2796) EXISTS FROM A DEPLOYMENT THAT DOES NOT 
REQUIRE A PDHRA, CLICK ON THE EDIT LINK TO ITS RIGHT.  IN THE PDHRA 
STATUS/LOCATION DROP DOWN LIST ON THE FAR RIGHT OF THE RESULTING WINDOW, 
SELECT ?(LESS THAN) 30 DAYS? OR ?SHIPBOARD.?  CLICK SAVE TO RETURN TO 
THE SAILOR?S DEPLOY TAB.  IF ANOTHER DD2796 IS LISTED FOR WHICH A PDHRA 
IS NOT REQUIRED, REPEAT THE PROCESS.
        (2) IF HARDSHIP DUTY PAY (HDP) DATES DO NOT MATCH A DEPLOYMENT 
THAT REQUIRES A PDHRA, CLICK ON THE EXCLUDE BUTTON TO THE RIGHT.  ENTER 
A COMMENT (REASON) WHEN PROMPTED, THEN CLICK SAVE.  IF ANOTHER (OLDER) 
SET OF HDP DATES NOW APPEARS, FOR WHICH A PDHRA IS STILL NOT REQUIRED, 
REPEAT THE PROCESS.
        (3) TO HELP COMMANDS EXPEDITE PDHRA COMPLIANCE, THE FOLLOWING 
ACTIONS ARE RECOMMENDED:
            (A) APPOINT A COMMAND DHA COMPLIANCE COORDINATOR.  THIS 
COULD ALSO BE THE COMMAND INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE (IA) COORDINATOR (CIAC) 
ASSIGNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH REF B.  IN ORDER TO GENERATE MRRS REPORTS 
USED TO TRACK DHA REQUIREMENTS AND COMPLIANCE FOR COMMAND PERSONNEL, 
REQUEST MRRS ACCESS AT HTTPS://MRRS.SSCNO.NMCI.NAVY.MIL/.
            (B) UNITS WITH LIMITED INTERNET CONNECTIVITY SHOULD CONTACT 
THEIR IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR IN COMMAND (ISIC) FOR ASSISTANCE.  THE ISIC 
MEDICAL DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVE CAN PERFORM THE ACTION ABOVE TO 
UPDATE MEMBERS LISTED IN MRRS.
            (C) COORDINATE WITH THE LOCAL MTF, RHRP CONTRACTOR, OR 
OTHER APPROVED DOD MEDICAL ORGANIZATION TO SCHEDULE APPOINTMENT BLOCKS 
TO COMPLETE PDHRAS.  ANNOUNCE THESE APPOINTMENT AVAILABILITIES IN THE 
PLAN OF THE WEEK AND PLAN OF THE DAY.
