RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the deployment and pilot of the Enlisted 
Advancement Worksheet (EAW) within the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel 
System (NSIPS).  This modification aligns with Sailor 2025 transformation 
efforts to deploy modernized systems and applications that better support 
Sailors personnel and career progression requirements.  EAW transitions the 
manual paper advancement worksheet to an automated process that leverages 
authoritative data and displays advancement eligibility factors for all E-4 
through E-7 candidates.  Most importantly, this pay and personnel 
modernization effort gives Sailors better control over their EAW and provides 
commands with a more efficient way to validate Navy enlisted advancement 
system (NEAS) requirements.
    a.  Commands with access to the NSIPS web are directed to set up their 
command EAW hierarchy by 15 January 2019 in preparation for the January 
through March 2019 pilot followed by the full EAW implementation in June 
2019.  The NSIPS web-afloat implementation timeline is dependent on the ship 
modernization process and availability of afloat units to receive and deploy 
the release package.
    b.  Training modules for EAW are posted on the NSIPS main page beneath 
the training section.  These tutorials include topics associated with user 
roles and detailed procedures to perform various EAW tasks.
    c.  Individual access to EAW and post-exam administrative comments will 
be made available through the MyNavy Portal (MNP) advancement dashboard in 
2019 as MNP enhancements are released.

2.  Enlisted Advancement Policy Changes.  EAW enhancements will have a 
significant impact to NEAS processes and policies as outlined in reference 
(a).  The following NEAS changes will be implemented on
3 June 2019:
    a.  The current paper worksheet will be replaced by an updated worksheet 
form within EAW.  The electronic form will automatically populate with Sailor 
final multiple score and eligibility data from NSIPS.  Sailors will have the 
ability to view EAW several months prior to exam administration, providing 
additional time for validation and corrections (if needed).
    b.  There will no longer be a requirement to enter Performance Mark 
Average (PMA) and award points on the Exam Answer Sheet of the Sailor during 
the exam administration.  PMA and award points of the Sailor will be system 
calculated and transferred from EAW to NEAS along with other EAW information.
    c.  Worksheet data cannot be modified after the EAW file is transferred 
to NEAS, which will be the day after each exam date for the Active duty 
component and the day after the exam month for the Reserve component.
    d.  When communicating with Commander, Navy Personnel Command 
(COMNAVPERSCOM), Commander, Navy Reserve Forces Command
(COMNAVRESFORCOM) or Naval Education and Training Professional Development 
Center (NETPDC), post-exam administrative discrepancy adjudication must be 
accomplished within EAW using the post-exam administrative comments 
functionality.  Commands will no longer use e-mail, messages or letters (via 
mail or fax) to correct Sailor information in NEAS.  All post-exam 
administrative advancement cycle communication will be visible to the Sailor, 
servicing educational services officer (ESO)/personnel office, the command 
and NEAS stakeholders.
    e.  All post-administration candidate record changes in NEAS must be 
accompanied by supporting documentation uploaded to EAW.
    f.  In line with references (b) and (c), EAW functionality will be 
updated prior to the release of advancement cycles 105 and 244 worksheets to 
capture the Professional Military Knowledge Eligibility Exam (PMK-EE) 
requirement and updates to advancement policy.

3.  EAW Timeline:
    a.  18 November 2018:  EAW deployed in NSIPS.
    b.  14 January 2019:  All commands with access to NSIPS web must 
establish EAW accounts in NSIPS.  Refer to
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/Advancement/Pages/EAW.aspx regarding account 
access and roles.
    c.  January 2019:  Begin EAW pilot (January through March), worksheets 
are released to ESOs for Reserve advancement cycle 104 and Active Duty 
advancement cycle 243.
    d.  3 June 2019:  E-4 through E-6 Worksheets are released to ESOs for 
Reserve advancement cycle 105 and Active Duty advancement cycle 244.
    e.  3 September 2019:  E-7 advancement candidate worksheets are released 
to ESOs for Active Duty cycle 246.
    f.  3 September 2019:  E-4 through E-6 Reserve component cycle
105 EAW file sent to NEAS.
    g.  6 September 2019:  Active Duty, Full-Time Support (FTS) and Canvasser 
Recruiter (CANREC) E-6 cycle 244 EAW file sent to NEAS.
    h.  13 September 2019:  Active Duty, FTS and CANREC E-5 cycle
244 EAW file sent to NEAS.
    i.  20 September 2019:  Active Duty, FTS and CANREC E-4 cycle
244 EAW file sent to NEAS.

4.  EAW Pilot.  A pilot will be conducted for advancement cycles 104 and 243.  
The purpose of the pilot is to validate that the automated solution meets the 
expectation of the User business needs.  Feedback from the pilot will be used 
to assess if capability is ready for future exam cycles.  To prepare, 
commanding officers will verify that all Sailors have access to EAW and their 
ESO and command representatives have system access and the correct roles 
within NSIPS to execute an advancement cycle using EAW.  During the pilot, 
the electronic form in NSIPS can be printed and used for the manual worksheet 
validation process.  No data will be transferred from EAW to NEAS and no 
discrepancies will be adjudicated in EAW during the pilot phase.
    a.  EAW pilot feedback must be provided by 1 April 2019.  An online tool 
will be developed and promulgated at
(http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/Advancement/Pages/EAW.aspx) to capture EAW 
pilot feedback prior to exam administrations.
    b.  The EAW pilot phase will not include an automated capability to 
calculate PMA with the reporting senior cumulative average (RSCA) in line 
with reference (c).
    c.  EAW programming will be updated prior to release of the cycles 105 
and 244 worksheets.  Updated EAW programming will include RSCA PMA 
calculations, the PMK-EE eligibility check and an updated worksheet form.

5.  Account Access and Roles.  For account access, initiate the System Access 
Authorization Request-Navy process for EAW from the NSIPS menu, New Users 
link.  There are 6 EAW administrator roles for additional information please 
visit
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/Advancement/Pages/EAW.aspx.

6.  EAW Routing.  Each Sailor participating in an advancement cycle will have 
an ESO responsible for worksheet processing.  The majority of worksheets will 
be routed from a regional or afloat ESO to a command ESO for processing.  
Stand-alone command ESOs, such as Navy operational support center ESOs, will 
similarly leverage EAW workflow functionality for routing worksheets to units 
and departments and ultimately down to the Sailor for worksheet validation.
    a.  Advancement worksheets will be established within NSIPS after 
publication of results from the previous advancement cycle.
Once published, worksheets will be viewable by all roles.  Early publication 
of worksheet information allows Sailors to gather documents and take 
corrective action in advance of the worksheet routing and verification 
process.
    b.  Worksheet data is not dynamic and must be manually updated by the ESO 
prior to the exam administration date.
    c.  Worksheet routing from the ESO to the Sailor, then back to the ESO, 
must be completed prior to the exam administration dates.
Command reviewers can assist Sailors with data verification and document 
upload once the EAW has been routed to the Sailor.
    d.  After exam administration, EAW post-exam administrative comments and 
discrepancy adjudication functionality must be used to correct candidate 
worksheets prior to advancement results publication.  ESOs can route post-
exam administrative comments to COMNAVPERSCOM Human Resource Specialists and 
NETPDC Records Administrators to ensure corrective actions are taken in line 
with reference (a).
