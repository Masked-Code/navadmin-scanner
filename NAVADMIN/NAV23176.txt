RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces an enhancement to the Navy Maternity Uniform 
Pilot Program (MPP) by providing participating Sailors options for issued 
maternity uniforms during their pregnancy. 
 
2.  Background.  Since January 2022, over 850 MPP Sailors have received one 
set of each type of authorized maternity uniform in line with references (a) 
and (b).  All components and items were delivered to the selected home of 
each participant and ready for wear at no personal cost. 
 
3.  Based on participant feedback, the Navy MPP will be expanded by offering 
a choice of sea bag component options to each participant to better align 
issued uniforms with daily duties and individual command uniform 
requirements. 
 
4.  Effective immediately, the Navy MPP will begin offering four maternity 
sea bag options.  Participants will also have the option to update their 
selection if uniform requirements change as directed by their 
command.  Available options include: 
    a.  Standard Option.  One of each type of maternity uniform and 
a cardigan sweater. 
    b.  Waterfront Option.  Two sets of Navy Working Uniforms (NWU), one 
Service Uniform, one Dress Uniform (Service Dress Blue or White), and a 
cardigan sweater. 
    c.  Ashore Staff Option A.  One set of NWUs, two Service Uniforms, one 
Dress Uniform (Service Dress Blue or White), and a cardigan sweater. 
    d.  Ashore Staff Option B.  Two Service Uniforms, one or two Dress 
Uniforms (Service Dress Blue or White one each), and a cardigan sweater.
