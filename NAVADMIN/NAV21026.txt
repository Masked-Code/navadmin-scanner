REF F IS NAVADMIN 298/20, US NAVY COVID-19 STANDARDIZED OPERATIONAL GUIDANCE 
VERSION 3.1.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN adds requirements for COVID-19 testing prior to 
international travel, in line with reference (a), to include testing prior to 
entry into the U.S. from a foreign country, as described in references (b) 
through (e).  Reference (a) is cancelled.

2.  The dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic requires the implementation 
of measures to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 spread.
Many countries, to include the U.S., now require negative test results before 
arrival.  In line with reference (c), and to ensure Service Members and 
families are not refused travel or delayed, all travelers executing 
international orders, to include returning to the U.S. from a foreign 
country, are required to have a negative viral COVID-19 test (molecular or 
antigen).  An antigen test may be used for testing prior to travel when a 
molecular test (such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Abbott ID NOW) is 
not available.
However, a molecular test is the preferred test prior to travel.  If the 
destination location requires a specific test, test timing, or test result 
format, travelers must follow the stricter requirement.
3.  Service Members and/or family members must do the following
    a.  Possess, and present on request, proof of a negative viral COVID-19 
test administered within 72 hours of embarkation for international travel for 
each traveling family member.  Valid proof may be electronic or printed for 
commercial flights.  Printed proof will be requested prior to Air Mobility 
Command (AMC) Patriot Express (PE) (i.e., rotator) or Military aircraft 
flights.
Travelers should verify specific country entry requirements to avoid delays, 
fines, or other complications upon arrival.
Note:  If previously infected with COVID-19, a molecular COVID-19 test may 
still produce a positive result.  If unable to achieve a negative result, 
consult with a medical provider, the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), and/or 
your travel provider to determine the necessary medical clearance 
documentation.  Documents likely include the proof of COVID-19 positive 
results, written documentation from the treating physician that the traveler 
has recovered, and the date of the onset of symptoms or positive test.
    b.  Review the FCG (https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/Fcg.cfm) to determine 
the exact entry requirements for the final destination (does not apply to 
routine intermediate stops).  COVID-19 travel information for travelers 
returning to the United States may be found on the Department of State 
website (https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/
en/traveladvisories/ea/covid-19-information.html).  Additionally, travelers 
are encouraged to register for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program 
(https://step.state.gov) for a free service enabling travelers to enroll 
their trip with the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.  This service provides 
updates from the embassy regarding travel requirements and safety conditions 
in the destination country.
    c.  Review associated destination requirements, such as type of test, 
timing or test result format, to determine specifics for entry that may be 
more restrictive than service policy, e.g., testing within 72 hours from 
arrival instead of embarkation - in this case, travelers must execute their 
testing in order to arrive at their embarkation site with proof and have 
sufficient time remaining to travel to their destination prior to the 
requirement expiring.
    d.  Plan intermediate travel and leave.  Do not place you and your family 
in extremis should an unexpected restriction of movement (ROM) be required 
while traveling prior to embarkation.  During trip planning, ensure you 
identify facilities along your route of travel that will accommodate you or a 
family member who may become COVID-19 positive.  Additionally, financially 
plan for an extended trip and/or additional tests should they become 
necessary.  Service Members are encouraged to use their Government Travel 
Charge Card (GTCC) for travel expenses on official orders as this will assist 
in alleviating personal financial impact.  TRICARE covers COVID-19 tests when 
medically necessary and appropriate.  Visit: 
https://www.tricare.mil/covid19testing for more details on COVID-19 testing 
coverage.  TRICARE does not fund strictly travel-based tests.  If not using a 
military facility, Service Members traveling on official orders should be 
prepared to pay for tests and be refunded via travel claim, in line with the 
Joint Travel Regulations.  For those that choose not to use the GTCC or do 
not possess a GTCC, advanced travel pay is encouraged since molecular-based 
tests may be expensive.  If paying for a commercial test that requires an 
upfront fee (copay), Service Members should ensure to submit the full testing 
cost via travel claim.
    e.  Take responsibility for testing.  The service is providing the 
following options to assist with individual travel situations, but it is the 
responsibility of the traveler to ensure all requirements have been met:
        (1) When traveling internationally from the U.S.:
            (a) Military treatment facilities (MTF) will execute free tests 
for Service Members and dependents in possession of international orders in 
line with reference (c).  Tests should be scheduled prior to arrival at the 
MTF.  MTFs should deliver hard copy documentation of test results within 24 
hours of testing to the Service Members and dependents.  This allows for 
testing in a different area than former duty stations to account for leave or 
training in route.  A non-inclusive list of preferred MTFs may be found on 
the Overseas PCS COVID-19 Testing Fact Sheet via the MyNavy Portal 
(https://www.mnp.navy.mil/covid-19.html).
Note:  Most MTFs are closed during the weekend and holidays.
Travelers are encouraged to plan for alternate testing solutions if boarding 
a flight at the beginning of the week.
            (b)  Travelers assigned to a U.S. Transportation Command
(USTRANSCOM)/AMC PE flight (i.e., rotator) may be tested at the Madigan Army 
Medical Center (Seattle) or Walter Reed National Military Medical Center 
(Bethesda) if travel timing precludes testing prior to arriving at the PE 
terminal.  If using this option, travelers should appear in person 48 hours 
prior to boarding at their respective Aerial Port of Embarkation (APOE).  
Walk-up testing is located in temporary shelters outside the facilities.  
Direct communication with the testing sites is limited.  Applicable contact 
information as follows:
                i.   AMC Gateway, Baltimore, MD:
                     Phone - (609) 253-8825
                     Schedule - Limited operations
                ii.  Walter Reed National Military Medical Center,
                     Bethesda, MD:
                     Phone  (Central Screening) (571) 335-9985
                     Schedule - 0700-1600 EST, no weekends or
                                holidays
                iii. AMC Gateway, Seattle, WA:
                     Phone - (253) 982-3504/0555
                     Schedule - Limited operations.
                iv.  Madigan Army Medical Center, McChord, WA:
                     Phone  (PrevMed) (253) 968-4443
                     Schedule - 0600-1700 PST, weekends/no holidays
            (c) Commercial sites that support antigen or molecular-based 
tests (e.g., PCR and Abbott ID NOW) may be used to satisfy the requirement.  
See planning and cost considerations above.
        (2) When traveling to the U.S. from a foreign country:
            (a) Travelers returning to the U.S. should primarily use their 
closest U.S. installation MTF.  COVID-19 testing results will be available 
via TRICARE Online, often within 24 hours of testing.
Results may be printed, if hard copies are required.  A list of preferred 
international MTFs may be found on the Overseas PCS COVID-19 Testing Fact 
Sheet via the MyNavy Portal (https://www.mnp.navy.mil/covid-19.html).
            (b) International commercial sites that support antigen or 
molecular-based tests may also be used to satisfy the requirement.  However, 
travelers should consult with their local installation, military liaison, or 
U.S. Embassy prior to doing so. See planning and cost considerations above.
    f.  Travelers that test positive for COVID-19 while executing 
international travel must do the following:
        (1) Immediately execute ROM procedures.  If a member of a family unit 
tests positive, the entire family unit must commence ROM.  Travelers may not 
proceed separately.  If not already in place at suitable lodging, priority 
for ROM site should be given to the following in order:  1) APOE, 2) home or 
detaching installation, 3) nearby family member, 4) nearby acceptable 
military installation and 5) nearby acceptable hotel.  Call ahead to the 
preferred ROM site for notification and support.  If no ROM site is available 
and additional support is required, call the MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) 
contact information below.  If at a U.S. PE APOE, USTRANSCOM/AMC will take 
immediate responsibility for the travelers, to include medical, lodging, pet 
services, meals and transportation support.
AMC will direct travelers to nearby military installations or participating 
lodging sites.  While in ROM, travelers must strictly adhere to force 
protection health guidance and return to work criteria, in line with 
reference (f).  Do not proceed until consulting with your detailer and/or AMC 
(if at a U.S. PE APOE).
        (2) Contact the MNCC for initial notification and additional support.  
Available 24/7, by phone at 1-833-330-MNCC (6622) or email at 
askmncc(at)navy.mil.  Provide valid contact information and proof of positive 
test result(s) to the servicing MNCC agent.  The servicing MNCC agent will 
take appropriate action to notify the Service Member detailer, Navy Passenger 
Transportation Office (NAVPTO), and the OPNAV COVID-19 Taskforce Liaison.
        (3) Continue communicating with your detailer and NAVPTO agent for 
orders modification (ORDMOD) and logistics support.  Upon notification from 
the MNCC, the detailer and NAVPTO agent will contact the Service Member to 
discuss an ORDMOD and re-book future travel.  ORDMODs will ensure per diem is 
available and reimbursable for qualified expenses incurred during the ROM 
period.  Service Members may use the GTCC if issued.  Additionally, Service 
Members may request a travel advance through the MNCC regardless of GTCC 
possession.
        (4) Secure from ROM.  Once the travelers meet return to work 
criteria, in line with reference (f) and in conjunction with any medical 
provider guidance, they may continue execution of their orders after 
conferring with detailers and/or AMC (if at a U.S. PE APOE).  Service Members 
and detailers should be proactive to continue travel as soon as possible.

4.  Command Pay and Personnel Administrators must do the following before a 
Service Member detaches:
    a.  Notify Service Member of the testing requirement for international 
travel and options.  Keep a record of the plans of the Service Member for 
testing, to include the intended facility site and date.
    b.  Counsel Service Members on the expense for commercial testing and 
discuss options for the potential financial burden, e.g. GTCC, advanced 
travel pay, reimbursement, etc.
    c.  Ensure the Service Member has detaching command contact information 
in case additional support is needed during an intermediate ROM status.

5.  Travelers with valid proof of COVID-19 vaccination are currently not 
exempt from the testing requirement.

6.  Contact the MNCC with any questions, issues or to provide feedback at 
833-330-MNCC/6622 or via e-mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil.
