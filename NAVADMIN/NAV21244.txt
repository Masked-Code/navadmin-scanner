RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a) and provides guidance for the 
Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22) Cybersecurity Awareness Challenge (CAC) training 
requirement. 
 
2.  Per references (b) and (c), Navy personnel, civilians, and contractors 
with access to unclassified or classified networks must complete the 
Department of Defense (DoD) employee version of CAC by 1 September 2022. 
 
3.  Authorized methods for training delivery: 
    a.  Commands can elect to complete CAC training using instructor-led 
delivery.  A command designated cyber security professional such as the 
Information Systems Security Manager (ISSM) or Cybersecurity Workforce (CSWF) 
Program Manager must provide the instruction. 
    b.  Total Workforce Management Service (TWMS), https://twms.navy.mil
/selfservice/login.asp; 
    c.  Navy e-Learning (NEL), https://learning.nel.navy.mil; (Note:  The My

redirects users to the NEL link);

/training/cyber-awareness-challenge/; 
 
4.  Ships can access the annual training from the NEL application hosted on

the need to reach back to shore-hosted NEL websites.  The CAC FY22 course is 
available via the NEL Afloat Learning Management System Pub Amendment 112 for 
download by the NIAPS Administrator using the normal manual NIAPS distance 
support update process.  If unable to download Learning Management System Pub 
Amendment 112, ships can request a DVD with these files to be mailed by 
submitting a support request to Navy 311. 
 
5.  Command training officers must validate training via TWMS or Fleet 
Training Management and Planning System (FLTMPS) 
(https://ntmpsweb.ncdc.navy.mil/fltmps/) authoritative databases.  Training 
officers will manually record training completed via the DISA website, DISA 
DVDs, or instructor.  Manually record training in FLTMPS using the Learning 
Event Completion Form.  Report any discrepancies to the Navy Training 
Management Planning System Operational Support office at 
ntmps.support(AT)navy.mil or 1-866-438-2898/DSN 922-1867. 
 
6.  Command ISSM shall report compliance meeting Federal Information Security 
Modernization Act of 2014 requirements.  Command ISSMs will disable accounts 
of users who do not complete training by 1 September 2022 and provide non 
-compliance list by 30 September 2022 to the echelon 2 training officer for

NAVIFOR CIO1 is Josh Wright, joshua.m.wright9.civ(AT)us.navy.mil.
