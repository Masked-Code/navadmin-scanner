SUBJ/FISCAL YEAR 2021 LOGISTICS AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES//

RMKS/1.  This message announces the Navy's education opportunities through 
the Center of Excellence in Logistics and Technology (LOGTECH) Institute for 
Defense and Business, University of North Carolina (UNC) during fiscal year 
2021 (FY21).  LOGTECH enables and energizes participants to improve 
operations and accelerate adoption of future logistics capabilities 
throughout their organizations.  Since 2001, LOGTECH has brought together key 
military officials from the Department of Defense (DoD), U.S. government 
executives, academic thought leaders, and senior private sector participants 
to explore crucial and timely issues in logistics, supporting technologies, 
and business practices.  Partnering with the Kenan-Flagler Business School at 
UNC-Chapel Hill, LOGTECH offers two distinct education programs for military, 
DoD, and private sector personnel.
    a.  LOGTECH Executive Course.  This program is designed for military Flag 
Officers and Senior Executive Service members to focus on strategic and 
organizational considerations from the senior executive perspective.   
FY21 Executive Course schedule:

    b.  LOGTECH Advanced Course.  The LOGTECH Staff at UNC uses lectures and
    working groups to explore leading-edge logistics technologies to prepare 
DoD logisticians for the future.  This program is designed for CWO-4 to CWO-5 
and O-4 to O-6 military officers and E-9 enlisted personnel, as well as GS-13 
to GS-15 civilians.  FY21 LOGTECH Advanced Course schedule:

    c.  LOGTECH is traditionally hosted in-residence at the Kenan-Flagler
    Business School at UNC-Chapel Hill.  The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019
    (COVID-19) mitigation may dictate hosting FY21 LOGTECH courses virtually.
    d.  FY20 LOGTECH applicants who were unable to attend due to COVID-19
    cancellations will receive priority consideration for FY21 LOGTECH 
courses and should re-apply for FY21 LOGTECH opportunities.
    e.  To obtain LOGTECH Advanced or Executive Course quotas, contact the 
Navy LOGTECH course manager.  All applicants must submit a standard Navy 
biography and signed Request, Authorization, and Certification of Trainings 
(SF-182).  Advanced course applicants must also include a logistics problem
statement for exploration during the course.  Navy course managers will 
provide all interested applicants an SF-182 with instructions, and a sample 
problem statement.  The Navys FY21 course managers are CDR Christopher 
Kading, OPNAV N413P at christopher.r.kading@navy.mil and Ms. Meghan Picha, 
OPNAV N413O at meghan.picha.ctr@navy.mil
   f.  LOGTECH is a competitive program.  Selections are based on the 
following criteria:  candidate qualifications (specifically career field and 
paygrade qualifications), package completeness (biography, SF-182, and 
problem statement), and the quality of the problem statement.
    g.  For additional course information, refer to the LOGTECH website at

program-in-logistics-technology/.

2.  Funding.  Tuition, travel, lodging, and partial per diem are centrally 
funded in FY21.  Commands are responsible for funding per diem on the days of 
travel only.
