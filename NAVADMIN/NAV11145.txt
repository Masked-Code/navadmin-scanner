SUBJ/OPERATION TOMODACHI BRAVO ZULU//

1.  THE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT EXHIBITED BY OUR NAVY IN SUPPORT OF OPERATION 
TOMODACHI MAKES ALL WHO SERVE EXTREMELY PROUD.  THE DEDICATION SHOWN BY OUR 
SAILORS IN PROVIDING CRITICAL HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND DISASTER RELIEF IN 
THE AFTERMATH OF THE DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE AND SUBSEQUENT TSUNAMI IN JAPAN ON 
MARCH 11 WAS INSPIRATIONAL.  IT FURTHER HIGHLIGHTS THE CLOSE PERSONAL 
FRIENDSHIP AND STRONG MARITIME PARTNERSHIP WE HAVE WITH JAPAN.  THE TEAM LED 
BY PACIFIC FLEET, WHICH INCLUDED THE RONALD REAGAN CARRIER STRIKE GROUP AND 
FORWARD-DEPLOYED NAVAL FORCES SAILED INTO AN UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT AND WORKED 
CLOSELY WITH JAPANESE COUNTERPARTS TO PROVIDE CRITICAL, RAPID, AND LIFESAVING 
RELIEF TO THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE OF JAPAN.  THE COMPASSION DEMONSTRATED BY 
OUR SAILORS SERVING ON OUR SHIPS, FLIGHT CREWS, AND FORCES ON THE GROUND TO 
LOCATE, RESCUE, AND BRING SUPPLIES AND RELIEF TO THE JAPANESE PEOPLE, WAS 
EXTRAORDINARY.
THE TIMELY, DEVOTED, AND PROFESSIONAL AID PROVIDED TO OUR LONGTIME ALLY 
EPITOMIZE THAT SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP.

2.  IN ADDITION TO THE WORK AT THE SCENE OF THIS DISASTER, OTHER COMMANDS 
CONTRIBUTED INVALUABLE SUPPORT.  NAVAL REACTORS PROVIDED TIMELY AND MISSION 
ESSENTIAL EXPERTISE AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO NAVY LEADERSHIP, OUR JAPANESE 
PARTNERS, THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, AND THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY AGENCY.  THEIR 
SUPPORT AND ADVICE TO OUR FORWARD DEPLOYED FORCES OPERATING IN AN UNCERTAIN 
ENVIRONMENT WAS INVALUABLE AND POSITIVELY IMPACTED THE EFFORTS AT THE DAMAGED 
FUKUSHIMA NUCLEAR FACILITY.  ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL COMMANDS AND NAVY SUPPORT 
ORGANIZATIONS WORKED TIRELESSLY TO ASSIST OUR SAILORS AND FAMILIES IN JAPAN AS 
THEY TRANSITIONED TO AND FROM SAFE HAVENS, CAREFULLY COORDINATING AND TRACKING 
REQUIRED TRANSPORTATION, WELCOME RECEPTIONS, CARE PACKAGES, AND A HOST OF 
LOGISTICAL/TRANSITION SUPPORT TO ENSURE OUR FAMILY NEEDS WERE QUICKLY 
ADDRESSED.  THE RESILIENCE AND VITAL IMPORTANCE OF OUR NAVY FAMILIES WAS ONCE 
AGAIN CLEARLY EVIDENT. THE LEADERSHIP AND AGILITY DEMONSTRATED AT ALL LEVELS 
IN SUCH A DYNAMIC AND CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT WERE NOTEWORTHY AND ENABLED 
NECESSARY DECISIONS THAT BEST SUPPORTED A CRITICAL WORLD PARTNER AND OUR NAVY 
FAMILY.

3.  FOR ALL THOSE INVOLVED, PLEASE PASS TO YOUR STAFFS, ASSIGNED COMMANDS, 
PERSONNEL, AND AFFECTED FAMILIES MY SINCERE GRATITUDE FOR A JOB EXCEPTIONALLY 
WELL DONE.  YOU HAVE SHOWN THE WORLD, YET AGAIN, THE UNDENIABLE GOOD WE 
ACHIEVE ACROSS THE GLOBE EVERY DAY.

4.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
