SUBJ/HEALTH OF THE FORCE SURVEY// 
 
RMKS/1.  Request all personnel currently on Active Duty participate in the 
Navy's annual Health of the Force (HoF) survey.  This voluntary and 
confidential survey will remain open from 6 May to 30 June 2024 and can be 
accessed on military or personal computers or a mobile device at: 
https://usnavy.gov1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_38kK5mRgGsuARIq or by 
using the QR code listed in the Fact Sheet attached to this NAVADMIN. 
 
2.  Command Triads are expected to lead by example, encourage their personnel 
to take the survey, and when able, enable completion as part of a normal work 
day.  Junior personnel are normally underrepresented in HoF results and on-
duty completion is a best practice to encourage their participation.  The 
results of the survey are personally briefed to the Chief of Naval 
Operations. 
 
3.  To access the survey, participants will be asked to provide their 
Department of Defense Identification number.  This information is only used 
to limit participation to Active Duty Navy personnel and minimize unnecessary 
demographic questions.  At no point will the answers be linked back to the 
individual. 
 
4.  HoF data is critical to assessing Navy's implementation of Culture of 
Excellence 2.0 and allows the assessment of key measures over time.   
Specifically, HoF survey is used: 
    a.  To produce Navy's annual HoF report.  The 2023 report is located at: 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Portals/55/Reference/Publications/CY23%20Health
%20of%20the%20Force%20Report.pdf?ver=WHbsCTZ3wzR-NBgzyQa-3Q%3d%3d. 
    b.  To provide data for Navy's Health of Community briefs, where 
community leads brief the Chief of Naval Operations every 12 to 18 months on 
the status of their communities. 
    c.  To assess the impact of Quality of Service initiatives, and how Navy 
policies are effecting Sailor personal and professional lives. 
 
5.  Every year, the HoF survey includes a core set of metrics relating to a 
Sailor's work environment and well-being.  On even years, to include 2024, 
the survey also includes questions about personal issues such as work/life 
integration, family planning, parenting in the Navy, access to medical care, 
physical fitness programs, on-base services, and communication within the 
Navy. 
 
6.  In addition to this NAVADMIN, Sailors with a valid email address in Navy 
Standard Integrated Personnel System should receive an email with details on 
how to access the survey. 
 
7.  The point of contact is the Office of Engagement and Innovation 
(OPNAV N176), Dr. Jen Jebo at Jennifer.l.jebo.civ@us.navy.mil. 
 
8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until 1 August 2024.
