SUBJ/INTERIM CHANGE TO THE NAVY ENLISTED ADVANCEMENT SYSTEM (NEAS)//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS IS THE SECOND IN A SERIES OF NAVADMINS
DETAILING NAVY INITIATIVES FOR OUR SAILORS WHO ARE MAKING
SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS BY SERVING ON THE GROUND IN THE FRONT
LINES OF THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM (GWOT).  SPECIFICALLY, IT
RECOGNIZES SAILORS WHO SERVE IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, OR THE HORN OF
AFRICA BY AUTHORIZING ADDITIONAL AWARD POINTS ON ADVANCEMENT
EXAMINATIONS, AND CHANGES THE ADVANCEMENT MANUAL
(BUPERSINST 1430.16E)
EFFECTIVE WITH THE ACTIVE DUTY CYCLE 195 (MAR 07) AND THE INACTIVE
DUTY
(RESERVE) CYCLE 080 (FEB 07) ADVANCEMENT EXAMINATIONS.
2.  MAKE THE FOLLOWING CHANGE TO THE LIST OF AWARDS CONTAINED IN
ARTICLE 318 OF THE ADVANCEMENT MANUAL: "GREATER THAN 179 CONSECUTIVE
DAYS OF SERVICE IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN OR THE HORN OF AFRICA
AUTHORIZES
TWO AWARD POINTS.  A MAXIMUM OF ONE AWARD (TWO POINTS) WILL BE
CREDITED
TO THE AWARDS FACTOR."
3.  THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA APPLY TO THIS CREDIT:
    A.  GREATER THAN 179 CONSECUTIVE DAYS MUST BE SERVED IN THE

UNTIL
THE CHANGES HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED IN THE DIRECTIVE THROUGH CHANGE
TRANSMITTAL OR REVISION.
6.  ALTHOUGH THIS INITIATIVE IS FOCUSED ON THE CENTCOM THEATER OF

FIGHT THE GWOT IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IT WILL BE EXPANDED AS
APPROPRIATE.
