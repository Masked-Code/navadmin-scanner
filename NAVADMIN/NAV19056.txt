SUBJ/CY2020 NAVY LEGISLATIVE FELLOWSHIP CALL FOR APPLICATIONS//

REF/A/DOC/BUPERS/17DEC12//
AMPN/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1560.21F, NAVY LEGISLATIVE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits applications for the 2020 Navy Legislative 
Fellows Program.  The Legislative Fellows Program allows naval officers, 
senior enlisted and Department of the Navy civilians to broaden their 
understanding of the legislative process and the operation of the U.S. 
Congress through a year-long full-time assignment to the office of a member 
of the House of Representatives or the Senate.  The Legislative Fellows 
Program also enhances the ability of the Navy to fulfill its role in the 
national policy development process.

2.  This is a highly competitive program.  Records must reflect sustained 
superior performance and potential for future assignments in critical 
billets.  Upon completion of the program, officers earn the legislative 
fellowship additional qualification designation.

3.  Military Applicants.  Participation is open to all Active Duty and Full-
Time Support unrestricted line, restricted line and staff corps officers in 
the permanent grades of O-3 through O-5.  Enlisted participation is open to 
all Active Duty Navy occupational specialty codes in the permanent grades of 
E-7 through E-9.  The selection process will focus on individual performance, 
promotion potential, academic and subspecialty qualifications, needs of the 
Navy and availability for follow-on assignment.  Officers with permanent 
change of station orders already issued will not be considered.
    a.  Applicants must be available for permanent change of station 
assignment to Washington, DC, from November 2019 through December 2020.  
During the fellowship, officers and senior enlisted Sailors will be assigned 
to the Office of Legislative Affairs for administrative purposes.  Upon 
execution of orders, fellows agree to serve for 3 years following completion 
or termination of the fellowship.  A follow-on utilization tour in 
legislative affairs is dependent on community-specific billet requirements, 
needed officer progression and availability of legislative assignments.  All 
officer applicants must contact their detailers for counseling on the career 
impact of participation in the Legislative Fellowship Program.
    b.  Submit applications via e-mail to the Office of Legislative Affairs 
point of contact no later than 15 April 2019.
