SUBJ/REALIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION OF FLEET 
SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS FOR ADVANCEMENT EXAMINATION READINESS REVIEWS//

REF/A/DOC/BUPERS/2NOV07//
AMPN/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1430.16F, ADVANCEMENT MANUAL FOR ENLISTED PERSONNEL 
OF THE U.S. NAVY AND U.S. NAVY RESERVE.//

RMKS/1.  In line with continued Rating Modernization efforts, this NAVADMIN 
announces a change of responsibility for the recruitment, identification, and 
selection of Fleet subject matter experts (FSME) for Advancement Examination 
Readiness Review (AERR) panels.  In line with reference (a), accountability 
for AERR FSME selection is transferred from U.S. Fleet Forces Command 
(COMUSFLTFORCOM) to Type Commands (TYCOM)/Rating Sponsors.  The primary 
intent of this change is to empower rating community leadership with the 
authority to recruit and select the most knowledgeable FSMEs to best reflect 
the priorities and way forward of each rating.

2.  Rating AERRs are conducted in order to provide fleet input to exam 
planning and content development.  AERRs provide an opportunity for selected 
rating subject matter experts from fleet and shore- based commands to impact 
full sailorization by affecting the careers of every test-taker in the Navy.  
Selected Chief, Senior Chief, and Master Chief Petty Officers on active duty, 
Full-Time Support (FTS), and reservists currently on active duty for special 
work (ADSW) may participate in the AERR process.  A MILPERSMAN article 
stating the policy and procedure of the AERR is forthcoming.

3.  Effective 1 January 2018, responsibility for recruitment and selection 
for AERR panels is as follows: 
Chief of Chaplains:  RP Commander, Naval Air Forces:  ABE, ABF, ABH, AC, AD, 
AE, AM, AME, AO, AS, ATI, ATO, AWF, AWO, AWR, AWS, AWV, AZ, PR

NOTE 1: Commander, Naval Surface Force is assigned as the lead for the STG 
rating. However, because STGs work in both the surface and submarine 
environments, Commander, Naval Surface Force and Commander, Submarine Force 
should coordinate closely in FSME identification to ensure proper rating 
representation at each AERR.

4.  TYCOMs/Rating Sponsors are responsible for identifying, recruiting, and 
selecting candidates from each respective rating. Selections should cover a 
wide diversity of rating experience and expertise.  Only the best qualified 
candidates should be selected.
    a.  Designate in writing by 25 October 2017, a representative who will 
solely be responsible for managing recruitment and selection of nominees for 
each respective rating under their cognizance.  A copy of the designation 
letter will be forwarded to Naval Education and Training Professional 
Development Center (NETPDC) via e-mail at sfly_netpdc_aerr(at)navy.mil.
    b.  Ensure AERR candidates meet eligibility requirements:
        (1) Be advanced to the paygrade of E7, E8, or E9.  Frocked E7 
candidates will be considered with a strong endorsement from their chain of 
command.
        (2) Be recommended by their commanding officer/officer in charge.
        (3) Have no relative, by blood or marriage, eligible for advancement 
for the rating AERR they are applying.
        (4) Have a MUST PROMOTE or EARLY PROMOTE on their latest evaluation 
and no adverse evaluation as a Chief in the last 3 years.
A waiver may be granted by NETPDC for a PROMOTABLE evaluation.
        (5) Be within the Navy body composition standards and have passed the 
most recent physical fitness assessment.
        (6) Not have a Fleet reserve, retirement, or high-year tenure date 
within 1 year of the scheduled AERR.  A waiver may be granted by NETPDC based 
on rating needs.
        (7) Have an active security clearance, if required by the rating.
    c.  Review all candidates, select the appropriately qualified number of 
FSMEs for the scheduled AERR, plus two alternates.  Choose FSMEs that reflect 
the entirety of the rating to include major platforms, navy enlisted 
classifications, and the future direction of the rating.  Ensure nominees 
have the required access to online reference material databases.
    d.  Provide to NETPDC the names, commands, and contact information of the 
primary and alternate selectees chosen to represent the rating, no later than 
45 days prior to the AERR convening date.  A quarterly NAVADMIN will announce 
upcoming AERRs at least 6 months in advance of AERR convening dates.

5.  NETPDC maintains an AERR schedule on My Navy Portal at
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-advancement-center/mycpo. NETPDC will 
send the standard nomination form, NETPDC 1420/1 (07/17),
Advancement Examination Readiness Review (AERR) Information Package, to AERR 
primary and alternate selectees.  Once nomination packages are returned, 
NETPDC will complete security background confirmation, System Authorization 
Access Request-Navy (SAAR-N) verification, Joint Personnel Adjudication 
System (JPAS) verification, and computer access before arrival aboard NETPDC.  
NETPDC is responsible for all FSME travel and accommodation logistics, 
including funding. NETPDC is located at Saufley Field, Pensacola, FL.  
Temporary duty travel for AERR is considered mission critical and is flag 
approved.

6.  Questions regarding the AERR process should be directed to Ms. Cheryl 
Dengler, NETPDC Fleet Liaison, who can be reached at (850) 473-6169/DSN 753, 
or e-mail at cheryl.dengler(at)navy.mil.
