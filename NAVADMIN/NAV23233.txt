2.  BACKGROUND. Beginning with our establishment in 1775 and continuing to 
today's current modern fleet, the U.S. Navy has stood the watch.  We continue 
to deploy forward as our nation's vital maritime maneuver force; persistent, 
versatile, capable of winning any fight and ready for the challenges of an 
unpredictable future.  Highlighting our Navy's enduring ability to remain 
fully ready to respond and effectively deter emanating threats, the theme for 
this year's Navy Birthday is "248 Years of Power, Presence, and Protection." 
 
3.  MISSION. As much as possible and within the bounds of personnel safety, 
operational availability, and existing local, state, and federal restrictions 
on gatherings and travel, commands are directed to find creative ways to 
celebrate the Navy's 248th Birthday.
