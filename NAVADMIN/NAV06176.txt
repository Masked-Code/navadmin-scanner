SUBJ/MASTER CHIEF PETTY OFFICER OF THE NAVY SELECTION// GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  I AM PLEASED TO
ANNOUNCE THAT I HAVE SELECTED
CMDCM(SW/FMF) JOE R. CAMPA, JR. AS OUR NEXT MASTER CHIEF PETTY OFFICER
OF THE NAVY.  HE WILL ASSUME HIS DUTIES ON 10 JULY 2006.
2.  CURRENTLY SERVING AS THE COMMAND MASTER CHIEF FOR JOINT TASK FORCE
GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA, CMDCM CAMPA BRINGS WITH HIM TO THIS ASSIGNMENT 26
YEARS OF FLEET AND FLEET MARINE FORCE EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING FOUR TOURS
AT SEA AND TWO WITH THE U.S. MARINE CORPS.  HE IS A DISTINGUISHED HONOR
GRADUATE OF THE U.S. NAVY SENIOR ENLISTED ACADEMY, A GRADUATE OF THE
U.S. ARMY SERGEANTS MAJOR ACADEMY, AND A RECENT GRADUATE OF THE NAVAL
WAR COLLEGE WITH A MASTER OF ARTS DEGREE IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND
STRATEGIC STUDIES.  HE STANDS READY FOR THE CHALLENGE AND IS QUALIFIED
IN EVERY RESPECT.
3.  MCPON SCOTT LEAVES IN HIS WAKE A LEGACY OF LEADERSHIP THAT WILL BE
DIFFICULT BOTH TO OVERSTATE AND TO EMULATE.  WE HAVE ALL BENEFITED FROM
HIS WISDOM AND HIS EXAMPLE AT A CRITICAL TIME IN OUR NATIONS HISTORY.
HE PROVED HIMSELF TO BE A TIRELESS ADVOCATE FOR AMERICAN SAILORS AND A
TRUE LEADER OF CHANGE WHEN CHANGE WAS A CHALLENGING VENTURE.
4.  LIKE HER SPOUSE, DOREEN SCOTT ALSO SERVED OUR NAVY WITH GREAT
DISTINCTION -- DILIGENTLY WORKING TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR OUR
FAMILIES AT EVERY TURN.  SHE IS A PERSON OF GREAT CHARACTER AND
COMPASSION, AND SHE, TOO, CASTS A LONG SHADOW.  I KNOW I SPEAK FOR
SAILORS EVERYWHERE WHEN I THANK THEM BOTH FOR THEIR EXTRAORDINARY
SERVICE.
5.  SELECTING MCPON SCOTTS SUCCESSOR WAS NO EASY TASK, AND THE
COMPETITION WAS KEEN.  MY SPECIAL THANKS GOES OUT TO ALL THE QUALIFIED
CANDIDATES WHO VOLUNTEERED TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS IMPORTANT AND
DEMANDING POSITION.  THEIR NUMBER AND THEIR QUALITY SPEAK VOLUMES ABOUT
THE CHARACTER OF THE NAVYS SENIOR ENLISTED RANKS TODAY.  WE ARE
FORTUNATE, INDEED, TO HAVE SUCH LEADERSHIP IN OUR INSTITUTION.
6.  AS I HAVE MADE CLEAR ON MANY OCCASIONS, THE CHIEFS RUN THE NAVY, AND
I SEE THE MCPON AS THE LEADER OF THE NAVY CHIEFS MESS.  I LOOK FORWARD
TO SERVING WITH MASTER CHIEF CAMPA AND TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH HIM ON
ALL OF THE IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING OUR SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES.
7.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL MIKE MULLEN, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.// BT
