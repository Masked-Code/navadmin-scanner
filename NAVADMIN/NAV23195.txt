RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 
Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) Captain Selective Retention 
(SELRET) Board. 
 
2.  The SELRET Board is required to retain TAR captains beyond 3 years' time 
in grade bringing TAR inventory in line with authorized end strength, 
allowing for stable promotion opportunity. 
 
3.  The FY24 TAR captain SELRET Board will convene on 18 September 2023 to 
consider TAR captains in all competitive categories for retention.  TAR 
captains who were promoted during FY22 will be looked at for their first gate 
and TAR captains who were promoted during FY19 will be looked at for their 
second gate.  In line with reference (a), second gate TAR captains not 
selected for retention will retire or be released from Active Duty no later 
than 1 September 2024, and first gate TAR captains not selected for retention 
will retire or be released from Active Duty no later than 1 September 2025.   
In either case, TAR officers will be retained on Active Duty, if necessary, 
to enable the officer to become eligible for a regular Active-Duty 
retirement.
