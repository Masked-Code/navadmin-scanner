RMKS/1.  Per reference (a), all U.S. Navy commands and activities with Navy 
and Marine Corps personnel will support the annual Navy-Marine Corps Relief 
Society (NMCRS) Active Duty Fund Drive (ADFD) from 1 March to 30 April 2020. 
This is an opportunity to contribute much needed funds for the direct benefit 
and support of our shipmates and fellow Marines.

2.  NMCRS does not receive government funding and depends upon the assistance 
of Active Duty and retired Sailors and Marines to help those in need at home 
and around the globe. Your contributions enable NMCRS in providing interest-
free loans and grants to our Shipmates facing financial challenges, including 
those who have been displaced by natural disasters and those who are dealing 
with family emergencies. In 2019, NMCRS used in excess of $858,000 of your 
donations to aid those impacted by Hurricane Dorian and the ongoing 
devastating effects of the California wildfires. Often, the financial 
assistance provided by NMCRS is the lifeline that makes the difference for 
Navy and Marine Corps families and keeps our Sailors and Marines focused on 
the mission when an unforeseen financial crisis exceeds their ability to make 
ends meet.

3.  Today, our Navy and Marine Corps families are better prepared to address 
the financial responsibility of marriage, the arrival of new family members, 
and car and home ownership because of the budget counseling and financial 
education provided by NMCRS volunteers.

4.  For over a century, NMCRS has kept faith with Sailors and Marines. The 
annual ADFD is your opportunity to help our brothers and sisters in arms. The 
campaign theme, "By Our Own, For Our Own," embodies our shared commitment to 
take care of our Shipmates and fellow Marines. I am grateful for those who 
have given generously in the past, and confident that, working together, we 
can achieve even more in 2020.

5.  As addressed in further detail below, Sailors and Marines are authorized 
to endorse, support, and participate in membership drives and fundraising 
events as long as commands and organizations uphold the Department of the 
Navy's policy of truly voluntary giving during the ADFD.
    a.  Commands and organizations are reminded to review the regulations
    governing fundraising for NMCRS to properly determine which activities 
are permissible during the ADFD. Per reference (a), authorized fundraising
    activities include, but are not limited to, command-sponsored raffles,
    lotteries, bake sales, car washes, gently used baby clothing sales, or 
bowling tournaments.  The following fundraising activities are prohibited: 
selling civilian clothes privileges or special liberty, raffling 
government parking spaces, sponsoring casino-like games of chance, 
soliciting civilian or contractor personnel, or soliciting outside of the 
Federal workplace. In U.S. jurisdictions, fundraising activities will be 
consonant with local law, and in foreign jurisdictions, fundraising will 
not contravene the status of forces agreement or other applicable law. 
Fundraising events must be conducted on Department of Defense owned or 
leased property. Commands and organizations are also strongly encouraged 
to communicate the benefits of NMCRS and its programs through achieving 
100 percent meaningful contact through speeches, meetings, and videos. 
Limited appropriated fund support is permissible for kick-off events, 
award ceremonies, and other non-solicitation events to build support.
    b.  References (a) through (c) prohibit any coercive activities counter 
to the policy of truly voluntary giving, such as setting personal dollar 
goals or 100 percent participation goals. The ADFD goal is $12.5 million, 
and no additional monetary fundraising goals will be used. Actions that 
are coercive and that do not allow free choice are prohibited. Therefore, 
individual donations are to be kept private and shall not be publicized.
    c.  Unit coordinators for the ADFD should consult their JAG or ethics
    counselor for further guidance with regard to specific questions.

6.  The roadmap to success is assigning motivated fund drive coordinators and 
key people to ensure 100 percent of our Sailors and Marines are afforded the 
opportunity to learn about the NMCRS mission and the critically important 
programs and services they provide to our Sailors, Marines and their 
families.
Best Practices and Lessons Learned from past NMCRS ADFDs may be viewed at 
http ://www.secnav.navy.mil/dalo/pages/campaigns.aspx.

7.  Our leaders, both Officer and Enlisted, are the best in the world, and I 
am confident that with their active support and engagement, NMCRS will remain 
positioned to continue the important work of helping our Sailors, Marines and 
their families. I encourage all who are able to consider making a 
contribution through payroll allotment, online credit card or cash to help 
our brothers and sisters in need. We need to take full advantage of this 
annual opportunity to help our Shipmates and fellow Marines through the 2020 
Active Duty fund drive campaign.

8.  Released by Mr. Andrew S. Haeuptle, Director, Navy Staff.//
