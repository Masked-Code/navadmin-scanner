RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance for the administration of the 
September 2022 (cycle 256) Navy-Wide Advancement Exam (NWAE) for active duty 
(AD) and training and administration of the reserves (TAR) (still referred to 
as FTS in some systems) to paygrades E-5 and E-6. It further provides 
guidance for the use of an alternative final multiple score (FMS) rank-order 
method, without an exam, for advancement to E-4. 
    a.  E-4 advancement candidates will not participate in an exam, but will 
be given the opportunity for advancement using an alternative FMS rank-order 
method, without the inclusion of an exam score from a proctored exam.  E-5 
and E-6 advancement candidates will be administered the NWAE utilizing 
single-day testing for each paygrade, per reference (b). 
    b.  In addition to the requirements in this NAVADMIN and chapter 6 of 
reference (b), educational services officers (ESO) must follow the pre-exam 
preparation requirements in the exam verbatim, which can be found on the navy 
enlisted advancement system (NEAS) website via MyNavy Portal (MNP) at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/command-
information/.  Select Command Advancement Tools, then NEAS Website. 
 
2.  Timeline 
    a.  31 July 2022:  Professional military knowledge - eligibility 
exam (PMK-EE) completion deadline for all E-4, E-5, and E-6 candidates. 
    b.  1 September 2022:  E-6 exam administration.  Enlisted advancement 
worksheets (EAW) will close one week after the exam date on the worksheet. 
    c.  8 September 2022:  E-5 exam administration.  EAWs will close one week 
after the exam date on the worksheet. 
    d.  15 September 2022:  E-4 EAWs must be completed by this date. 
    e.  Deviation from administration dates.  In line with reference (b), 
should the necessity of an expanded window of NWAE administration be required 
due to a resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic, commands may request a 
deviation of NWAE administration from Navy Personnel Command  
(PERS-8).  Deviation from single day testing will not be authorized for 
convenience, rather as a result of heightened regional health protection 
measures or other valid reason.  Solely within the context of an authorized 
deviation, NWAE administration will be authorized through 30 September 
2022.  Refer to reference (g) for additional details on safety and mitigation 
measures in the conduct of exams during the coronavirus pandemic. 
 
3.  Eligibility requirements are found in chapter 2 of reference 
(b).  The following information is specific only to cycle 256: 
    a.  The terminal eligibility date used to compute time in rate 
(TIR) is 1 January 2023. 
    b.  The minimum TIR date must be on or before: 
        E-6 - 1 January 2020 
        E-5 - 1 January 2022 
        E-4 - 1 July 2022 
    c.  E-6 candidate TIR requirements for early promote (EP) Sailors can be 
waived by one year with commanding officer (CO)/officer in charge (OIC) 
approval, in line with paragraph 214.e of reference (b).  Cycle 256 EAW must 
be manually created for all E-6 EP TIR waiver authorized candidates. 
    d.  High-year tenure (HYT) date must be effective 1 January 2023 or 
later.  All HYT waivers must be approved prior to 1 September 2022 to be able 
to participate in cycle 256. 
    e.  Candidates in a rating requiring a security clearance must have a 
favorable investigation adjudication by the Department of Defense 
consolidated adjudication facility reflected properly in the Defense 
Information System for Security (DISS) prior to 1 September 2022.  If the 
CO/OIC of the candidate grants an interim clearance, it must be entered in 
DISS prior to 1 September 2022.  Candidates must maintain security clearance 
eligibility throughout the advancement cycle to be eligible for 
advancement.  If, for any reason, a clearance is denied, revoked or not 
reflected in DISS, an exam is not authorized and commands should not allow 
candidates to take the exam until the discrepancy is corrected or a new 
clearance is granted and is properly reflected in the EAW of the candidate. 
Ratings requiring a security clearance are AC, AE, AG, AO, ATI, ATO, 
AWF, AWO, AWR, AWS, AWV, AZ, CTI, CTM, CTN, CTR, CTT, EOD, ET, FC, 
FCA, GM, HT, IC, IS, IT, LN, MA, MC, MN, ND, OS, QM, SB, SO, STG, YN 
and all nuclear and submarine ratings.  Refer to references (b) and 
(c) for additional guidance. 
    f.  Candidates for advancement to E-4 and E-5 must compute performance 
mark average (PMA) using all applicable evaluations in the current pay grade 
of the candidate with an ending date that falls within the following time 
periods: 
        E-4 - 1 January 2022 to 31 August 2022 
        E-5 - 1 June 2021 to 31 August 2022 
    g.  Candidates for advancement to E-6 must compute the reporting senior 
cumulative average (RSCA) PMA, as outlined in reference (d), using all 
applicable evaluations in the current pay grade with the ending date that 
falls within the time period: 
        E-6 - 1 September 2019 to 31 August 2022 
    h.  Refer to reference (d) and paragraph 308.b. of reference (b) for 
additional guidance on RSCA PMA and PMA, including guidance on establishing 
PMA for new accessions that have graduated from *A* school and do not have a 
current evaluation. 
    i.  For guidance on establishing EAW user roles and completing 
worksheets, refer to reference (e).  EAW is mandatory for cycle 256 and will 
be the authority for PMA, RSCA PMA, and awards. 
    j.  Completion of relevant paygrade PMK-EE is mandatory for cycle 256 
candidates competing for advancement, even if no NWAE is being administered, 
and must be successfully completed once for the administration paygrade.  The 
PMK-EE completion deadline is 31 July 2022, in accordance with reference 
(f).  No Sailor competing for advancement shall be permitted to participate 
in the advancement cycle without having a completed PMK-EE for the exam 
paygrade.  For E3 and E4 new accession candidates authorized PMK-EE 
completion deadlines, refer to references (h) and (i). 
    k.  Commands must accurately validate, complete and finalize all EAWs in 
the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) in a timely manner.   
E-4 EAW accuracy is critical since NEAS will be reprogrammed to use finalized 
E-4 EAWs rather than the candidate exam answer sheets to create E-4 candidate 
records.  The success of this process will be dependent upon the accurate 
completion of E-4 EAWs to establish advancement cycle participation.  Cycle 
256 E-4 EAWs must be completed by 30 September 2022. 
 
4.  Exam Ordering.  Order exams in line with chapter 4 of reference (b). 
    a.  Deploying commands and candidates departing to congressionally-
designated combat zones and approved contingency operations areas (CDCZ/ACOA) 
can order exams up to six months prior to the scheduled exam date.  For 
additional guidance, refer to chapter 4 and paragraph 614 of reference (b). 
    b.  Regular Exams: 
        (1) Sensitive compartmented information (SCI) Exams.

can be found on the NEAS website via MNP at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/command-
information.  Select Command Advancement Tools, then NEAS website. 
ESOs must verify initial Active TIR eligibility lists on the NEAS website for 
exam ordering.  Supplemental TIR SCI exams are ordered via message formatted 
e-mail to sfly_cryptologic.products(at)navy.mil or by naval message following

        (3) All candidate exam orders not included on the initial TIR list 
must be ordered in NEAS web by entering a Department of Defense 
Identification (DoD ID) for each candidate instead of by e-mail or naval 
message.  This is a change to guidelines in chapter 4 of reference 
(b).  Orders submitted after supplemental TIR list closure will result in a 
substitute exam being sent. 
    c.  Substitute Exams: 
        (1) The deadline for ordering both SCI and non-SCI substitute exams 
is 30 September 2022.

        (3) Recent graduates of the Naval nuclear propulsion program training 
pipeline, who are on transfer leave enroute to their first at sea assignment 
during the E-5 examination date, will have substitute examinations ordered 
for them by their ultimate duty station, if dates permit exam ordering before 
the published deadline. 
        (4) Substitute examinations may be administered with regular exam 
administration or in line with paragraph 606 of reference (b). 
    d.  ESOs must verify examination orders at the *View Previous Exam
