RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the release of the Blended Retirement System 
(BRS) Comparison Calculator.

2.  On 1 January 2018, in order to provide a more modern and flexible 
retirement system for its members, the military services will transition to 
the BRS as directed in reference (a).  As indicated in references (b) through 
(d), in an effort to facilitate a smooth transition to BRS, training is 
offered to all Service Members.  Under the BRS, some Navy personnel will be 
eligible to opt-in to the BRS.  Opt-in criteria is clearly delineated in 
reference (c) and, in general, it applies to all Active Component members who 
have fewer than 12 years of service and Reserve Component members who have 
fewer than 4,320 retirement points on 31 December 2017.

3.  The BRS Opt-In online comparison calculator is now available at
http://militarypay.defense.gov/Calculators/BRS/.  Navy personnel can enter 
their personal financial data to determine which retirement system is best 
for them.  Although the comparison calculator is an informative BRS tool, 
Navy personnel should also consult their command financial specialists, 
personal financial managers or Military OneSource personal financial 
counselors to be better informed when making the opt-in decision.

4.  For Navy personnel who are opt-in eligible, BRS Opt-in training is 
mandatory.  Commands will ensure that eligible members complete this training 
and document this training in Fleet Training Management and Planning System.  
BRS Opt-in training is available on Navy E-Learning (course number:  JKDDC-
BRS-OPT-IN-1.0) which can be accessed through My Navy Portal at 
https://my.navy.mil/, on Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) at
https://jkodirect.jten.mil/Atlas2/page/login/Login.jsf (course number:  
J3OP-US1332) and on digital video device (DVD).  DVDs can be ordered through 
the Defense Imagery Management Operations Center (DIMOC).  Order forms are 
located at http://www.dimoc.mil/customer/contact.html.  In the comments 
section of the order form, include the following:  Course Title (J3OP-US1332 
Blended Retirement System Opt-In (2hrs)), Pin Number 505679, quantity (if 
requesting more than 50 copies, please provide justification), branch of 
service, and shipping address (include the name of who will be receiving the 
package).  These DVDs are provided at no cost to the requesting command.

5.  Additional resources available to aid Navy personnel in the opt-in 
decision include:  a financial literacy mobile application (available in the 
Navy APP Locker or by searching Navy Financial Literacy in the Application 
Store for iOS products and Google Play Store for Android products) and an 
Office of the Secretary of Defense sponsored BRS website at
http://militarypay.defense.gov/BlendedRetirement.  For Service Members with 
additional questions, they can email NavyFinMgmt(at)navy.mil and their 
questions will be answered as they are received.

6.  The importance of the decision to opt-in to BRS or remain in the current 
retirement system cannot be overstated.  Not only is this decision 
irrevocable, but it is likely the most important financial decision in the 
naval career of an opt-in eligible Service Member. If you are opt-in 
eligible, it is in your best interest to ensure that the training is complete 
and that you are using all available resources to make the most informed 
financial decision possible for your future and that of your family.

7.  Released by Vice Admiral R. P. Burke, N1.//
