RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN modifies reference (a) by revising early 
separation policy to offer early separation on a case-by-case basis 
to enlisted Sailors.  Reference (a) remains in effect for officers. 
 
2.  As the Navy has grown over recent years, some enlisted ratings 
at specific paygrades have become overmanned due to high retention 
in these ratings.  In an effort to provide well-balanced enlisted 
ratings in support of community rating health, the Navy is opening 
up opportunities for eligible Sailors to submit requests for early 
separation, conversions or transfer to the Fleet Reserve. 
 
3.  Voluntary early separations will be considered on a case-by-case 
basis in the following policy areas: 
    a.  In lieu of forced conversion.  Early separation in lieu of 
forced conversion will be offered for Sailors with less than 12 
months to their soft expiration of active obligated service (SEAOS). 
As outlined in reference (b), members may request immediate 
voluntary early separation in lieu of forced conversion or 
administrative separation.  Requests must contain a statement of 
understanding that any unearned bonuses will be recouped and 
separation pay will not be authorized. 
    b.  To pursue education opportunity.  Sailors may request an 
early out in order to further their education.  For those who have 
greater than 90 days of service to their SEAOS, requests must be 
submitted to the Enlisted Separation and Performance Division (PERS- 
832), as outlined in reference (c).  Commanding officers (COs) with 
special courts-martial convening authority or higher serve as the 
separating authority for education separation requests that are 
within 90 days of the SEAOS of the Service Member. 
    c.  Conditional release for commissioning or enlistment 
opportunities.  Members interested in applying for a commissioning 
program in the Navy or to another branch of service, and members 
interested in an inter-service transfer for enlistment into another 
branch of service, must request a conditional release from PERS-832 
via their CO as outlined in reference (d).  COs and Sailors are 
reminded that only the Commander, Navy Personnel Command (CNPC) can 
approve conditional release requests. 
    d.  Enlisted Early Transition Program (EETP).  Use of EETP is 
hereby restored.  EETP is a quota-controlled voluntary separation 
program.  Available quota opportunity is identified by rating, 
paygrade, year group and navy enlisted classification.  Quotas are 
updated periodically to reflect opportunity.  Early separation will 
be granted on a first-come, first-serve basis until all quotas are 
exhausted in the respective rating.  EETP opportunities and the 
application process can be found on the Navy Personnel Command (NPC) 
website via MyNavy Portal at https://my.navy.mil, then click *Quick 
Links* and then the *NPC* tab.  Once on the NPC website, navigate to 
the *Enlisted* dropdown, then select *Community Managers* and 
navigate down to the *EETP* link.  Early separation requests will 
not be approved for Sailors in nuclear ratings. 
 
4.  Rating Conversion Opportunity.  In an effort to provide well- 
balanced enlisted ratings and to retain talented and experienced 
Sailors, conversion opportunities are available.  All Sailors 
considering early out options are also highly encouraged to seek 
conversion to other ratings for which they are eligible and 
qualified.  Command Career Counselors and Enlisted Community 
Managers are available resources for determining the ratings for 
which a Sailor is best suited. 
 
5.  Transfer to Fleet Reserve.  Fleet Reserve policy found in 
reference (e) is hereby reinstated.  This policy authorizes the 
Active Duty Enlisted Retirements Branch (PERS-836) to approve 
agreed-upon recommendations from active component Enlisted Community 
Managers (BUPERS-32), Reserve Enlisted Community Managers (BUPERS- 
352), Officer and Enlisted Nuclear Programs Branch (OPNAV N133) and 
Enlisted Distribution Division (PERS-40) for all Active Duty and 
Full-Time Support Sailors with obligated service time remaining on 
their enlisted contract to transfer to the Fleet Reserve. 
    a.  BUPERS-32, BUPERS-352 and OPNAV N133 will review each early 
separation and transfer to the Fleet Reserve request for 
consideration on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the total 
manning posture of the Navy, planning factors and rating health. 
    b.  All such requests will be adjudicated by PERS-40 to ensure 
sea and critical shore billets are not negatively impacted.  Any 
request that would negatively affect sea duty manning will be 
disapproved. 
 
6.  Navy remains committed to ensuring Fleet readiness by providing 
well-trained Sailors in the right paygrade with the right skills and 
experience at the right time.  Ensuring proper rating health, by 
balancing rating paygrades, while retaining the necessary knowledge, 
skills and experience in the Fleet is instrumental to maintaining 
our warfighting advantage. 
 
7.  Questions and concerns regarding these policy changes may be 
referred to MyNavy Career Center at askmncc(at)navy.mil or 1-833- 
330-MNCC(6622).
