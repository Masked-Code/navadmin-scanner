3.  Each applicant should take pride in knowing that the superior performance 
documented in the evaluations reviewed by the board required the members to 
dedicate long hours in making hard choices to ensure only the best and fully 
qualified applicants were selected.  I am confident that each selectee will 
justify their selection time and again in their new career as naval officers. 
Those not selected are highly encouraged to seek out an LDO/CWO in your area 
for advice on ways to grow professionally and improve opportunity for future 
selection.  Bravo Zulu to all who were willing to answer the call. 
 
4.  This message is not authority to issue appointments.  Frocking is 
prohibited.  COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS 806) will deliver appointments to Reserve 
Support (PERS-92) approximately 60 days prior to the commissioning 
date.  PERS-92 will also process the conversion from enlisted to officer 
status for LDOs and CWOs. 
 
5.  Commanding Officers are directed to: 
    a.  Notify selectee. 
    b.  Notify PERS 92 via official correspondence not later than 10 days 
following release of this message of selectees who do not accept 
appointment.  Selectees who decline their commission within this 10 day 
period will be considered by the FY 22 Reserve Enlisted Selection 
Boards.  After the 10 day period, PERS 92 will invalidate all FY 22 Reserve 
LDO and CWO In Service Procurement Selection Board selectees eligibility for 
the FY 22 Reserve Enlisted Selection Boards. 
    c.  Per reference (a), ensure LDO and CWO selectees obtain a 
commissioning physical within 90 days preceding the appointment month.   
Notify PERS-92 upon completion. 
    d.  Administer official physical fitness assessment (PFA) within 
4 months of commissioning date.  Selectees must hand carry test results to 
Officer Indoctrination School, Newport, RI.  If selectee fails to achieve 
satisfactory medium, notify PERS-92.  Hold commissioning in abeyance until 
successful completion of PFA. 
    f.  Hold appointment in abeyance if it is determined that a selectee is 
no longer mentally, physically, morally or professional qualified or if they 
fail to meet current PFA requirements. Immediately forward documentation 
citing reason to PERS-92. 
 
6.  If an LDO or CWO selectee's enlistment (including any extensions) expires 
after the date of appointment, they are not reenlistment eligible unless 
appointment is declined. 
 
7.  Each selectee should contact PERS-92 for submission requirements with 
regard to personal information and address changes to facilitate appointment 
delivery.
