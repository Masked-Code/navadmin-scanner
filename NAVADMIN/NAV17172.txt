RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits applications and provides guidance for the 
FY-18 Enlisted to Medical Degree Preparatory Program (EMDP2).

2.  The EMDP2 is a 2-year undergraduate education program open to enlisted 
personnel of all ratings who meet eligibility requirements in line with 
reference (a).  The EMDP2 is a partnership between the Uniformed Services 
University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) and the armed services to provide 
an opportunity for highly-motivated, academically promising enlisted service 
members.  The EMDP2 consists of intensive coursework, preparation and 
mentoring to prepare students for application to medical school.  Upon 
completion of the program, successful students will be competitive for 
acceptance to U.S. Medical schools.

3.  Selectees are assigned to the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, 
MD for a 24-month period.  Individuals selected for the EMDP2 program will 
remain on active duty while completing coursework and will receive pay, 
allowances, benefits, and privileges of current paygrade.  Selectees will 
receive permanent change of station orders to USUHS for the entire length of 
the course.  All school expenses (i.e., books, tuition, labs, etc.) will be 
paid by USUHS for the entire length of the course.

4.  Deadline for submission of applications for FY-18 enrollment is 
1 November 2017.  Application packages must be postmarked on or before the 
deadline date.  No additional documents or packages will be accepted after 
this date.  The selection board will convene in December 2017.  All 
application requirements are specified in reference (a) which can be found at 
https://www.usuhs.edu/emdp2,
http://www.med.navy.mil/ or http://www.public.navy.mil/.

5.  Strict adherence to package submission requirements will be a primary 
factor for selection.  The application is a reflection of the applicant.  
Applicants must review their package in its entirety before submitting.  A 
minimum score of good on the latest physical fitness assessment and 
qualifying Scholastic Assessment Test/American College Test scores are 
required.

6.  This NAVADMIN does not modify any previous guidance contained in 
reference (a) regarding selective reenlistment bonus.

7.  Applicants assigned to a nuclear training command or who hold a nuclear 
navy enlisted classification (335x, 336x, 338x 339x) and are applying for the 
FY-18 EMDP2 selection board must obtain conditional release from nuclear 
field duty prior to submitting an application for consideration for the FY-18 
board in line with NAVADMIN 070/13. To obtain a conditional release, 
applicants must submit an Enlisted Personnel Action Request (NAVPERS 1306/7) 
to Nuclear Propulsion Program Management (OPNAV N133) via the detailer at 
Enlisted Nuclear/Submarine Assignment (PERS-403).  The FY-18 EMDP2 selection 
board will only consider nuclear enlisted candidates who have conditional 
release included in their EMDP2 application.
