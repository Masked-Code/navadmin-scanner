Officer (CO), USS RHODE ISLAND (SSBN 740) (GOLD) (U.S. Fleet Forces Command) 
and Commander Jeffrey C. Fassbender, former CO, USS SEAWOLF (SSN 21) (U.S.

aviation squadron, Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) team, Naval special warfare 
squadron, SEAL delivery vehicle team, special boat team, explosive ordnance 
disposal mobile unit, mobile diving and salvage unit, or Navy special 
clearance team during the nomination cycle.  Candidates are nominated by 
peers who themselves must be eligible for the award.

review process that included screening at the Fleet commander level and final 
selection by a board of senior officers.
