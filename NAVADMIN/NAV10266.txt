SUBJ/CRIME REDUCTION PROGRAM INTRODUCES THE GANG AWARENESS CAMPAIGN//

REF/A/DOC/DOD/27NOV2009//

AMPN/REF A IS DODINST 1325.06, HANDLING DISSIDENT AND PROTEST 
ACTIVITIES AMONG MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES//

RMKS/1. THE CRIME REDUCTION PROGRAM (CRP) IS A COMMUNITY OUTREACH 
INITIATIVE DESIGNED TO REDUCE CRIMINAL THREATS AFFECTING THE DEPARTMENT 
OF THE NAVY (DON). IT IS LED BY THE NAVAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE 
SERVICE (NCIS) AND INCLUDES BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY SERVICE 
PARTNERS WITHIN DON. EACH QUARTER, THE CRP IDENTIFIES A RELEVANT ISSUE 
TO HIGHLIGHT THROUGH A ROBUST BRIEFING PROGRAM AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH 
EVENTS. FROM 1 JULY - 30 SEPTEMBER 2010, THE CRP WILL FOCUS ITS EFFORTS 
ON GANG ACTIVITY WITHIN THE NAVY.

2. REF A UNDERSCORED THE POLICY THAT A SERVICE MEMBER'S AFFILIATION 
WITH A GANG IS NOT A CRIME. HOWEVER, ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN A CRIMINAL 
GANG OR EXTREMIST ORGANIZATION IS SUBJECT TO ADMINISTRATIVE OR 
DISCIPLINARY PUNISHMENT. THE INFLUX OF GANG CULTURE INTO THE DON 
POTENTIALLY THREATENS THE GOOD ORDER, DISCIPLINE, AND PROFESSIONALISM 
THAT THE NAVY REPRESENTS.

3. WHILE THE NUMBER OF SAILORS KNOWN TO BE ACTIVE MEMBERS OF CRIMINAL 
GANGS OR EXTREMIST GROUPS IS LOW, THERE HAVE BEEN UNSUBSTANTIATED 
REPORTS THAT GANG MEMBERS ARE JOINING THE MILITARY TO RECEIVE COMBAT 
AND WEAPONS TRAINING. GANG MEMBERS WITH MILITARY SKILLS MAY PRESENT A 
SERIOUS THREAT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CIVILIAN COMMUNITIES AS A RESULT 
OF THESE SKILLS AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO TEACH URBAN WARFARE TACTICS TO 
THEIR FELLOW GANG MEMBERS.

4. THROUGHOUT THIS THREE-MONTH CAMPAIGN, NCIS CRP REPRESENTATIVES WILL 
VISIT A VARIETY OF COMMANDS TO PROVIDE GANG AWARENESS BRIEFINGS. BY 
HIGHLIGHTING THIS THREAT TO THE NAVY, NCIS, NAVY COMMANDS, AND ALL NAVY 
PERSONNEL CAN WORK TOGETHER TO ELIMINATE IT.

5. RELEASED BY VICE ADMIRAL SAM J. LOCKLEAR III, DIRECTOR, NAVY 
STAFF.//
