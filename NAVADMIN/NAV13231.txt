MSGID/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/N1/SEP// SUBJ/PHYSICAL READINESS PROGRAM POLICY 
CHANGES// REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/11JUN11// REF/B/DOC/OPNAV/12JAN09// NARR/REF A IS OPNAVINST 
6110.1J, PHYSICAL READINESS PROGRAM.  REF B IS OPNAVINST 6100.3, DEPLOYMENT HEALTH 
ASSESSMENT (DHA) PROCESS.//

 RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN outlines policy changes to ref (a) that are effective upon the release of this 
NAVADMIN.
    a.  Sailors requiring a deployment health assessment (DHA) in the form of either a Post Deployment 
Health Assessment (PDHA) or a Post Deployment Health Re-assessment (PDHRA), must be within 
assessment periodicity to participate in the PFA.
    b.  The number of days allowed for Sailors to complete the physical readiness test (PRT) after the 
official body composition assessment (BCA) date is increased from 10 to 45 days.

2.  Medical clearance.  Per ref (a), paragraph 5b; the PFA includes a medical screening, BCA, and PRT.  
    a.  Per ref (a), enclosure (1) paragraph 4d, Sailors shall not participate in the PRT without medical 
clearance.  New medical screening policy requires all Sailors to maintain a current PHA, which includes, 
when required, a current DHA - either PDHA or PDHRA.  
Sailors required to complete a DHA that are not current and those who have not completed a PHA 
within the required periodicity are precluded from participation in the PRT portion of the PFA.  If a PFA 
(BCA and PRT) is not completed because of a delinquent PHA or DHA, the commanding officer (CO) may 
assign the member a "UA" status in the Physical Readiness Information Management System (PRIMS) for 
the missed PFA.
    b.  All personnel are required to complete their Physical Activity Risk Factor Questionnaire (PARFQ) in 
PRIMS as a prerequisite to participate in the PFA.  The PARFQ is not valid unless the PHA and, if required, 
the DHA are within the required periodicity.
    c.  A "yes" response to any question on the current cycle PARFQ other than question one, requires 
medical clearance be documented on the bottom of the PARFQ and certified by an authorized medical 
provider unless a medical waiver is required.  If a medical waiver is required, the waiver must be issued 
on the official PFA medical waiver/clearance (NAVMED 6110/4) and approved by the CO prior to the 
BCA portion of the PFA.  
    d.  A PARFQ is not required if the PRT will not be conducted (i.e.  DEP/OP, IA, TAD, etc).

3.  Sailors can check the status of their PHA/DHA by logging into BUPERS on-line at 
https://www.bol.navy.mil/ and selecting individual medical readiness status.

4.  BCA scheduling requirements.  The BCA shall be completed within 45 days of, but not less than 24 
hours prior to, participation in the PRT.  The official BCA is the first and only BCA taken during the 
command PFA.  If the recorded PRT is not completed within 45 days of the official BCA, the CO may 
assign a participation status of "UA"  for the PRT.  This policy applies to both active and reserve Sailors.
5.  Above policy updates will be incorporated into the forthcoming revisions of refs (a) and (b).

6.  Point of contact is Mr. Bill Moore, Director, Physical Readiness Program, N170 at (901) 874-2210/DSN 
882, or via e-mail at navyprt(at)navy.mil.
