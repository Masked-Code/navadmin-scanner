RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the results of the Fiscal Year (FY)
2020 Enlisted to Medical Degree Preparatory Program (EMDP2) from reference

2.  As outlined in reference (b), EMDP2 is a 2-year undergraduate education 
program open to enlisted personnel of all ratings who meet eligibility 
requirements.  The EMDP2 is a partnership between the Uniformed Services 
University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) and the Armed Services to provide 
an opportunity for highly-motivated, academically-promising enlisted Service 
Members.  The EMDP2 consists of intensive coursework, preparation and 
mentoring to prepare students for application to medical school.  Upon 
completion of the program, successful students will be competitive for 
acceptance to U.S. medical schools.

requirements but fail to obtain acceptance to a medical school, or who are 
disenrolled from the program, will be detailed at the discretion of Navy 
Personnel Command.

date of the program, in line with reference (c).
