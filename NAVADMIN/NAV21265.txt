qualifying years of service (YOS) or greater than 28 years length of service

mobilized remain eligible. 
       (3)  FTS E-8 personnel will not have less than 16 years or greater

unless they have completed orders by 31 December 2021.  SELRES who are 
mobilized remain eligible for conversion. 
 
3.  For record review and communication with the CMDCS and CMDCM screen 
board, the preferred method to submit packages is via encrypted e-mail to 
cscselboard(at)navy.mil.  Do not use the electronic submission of selection 
board documents to submit packages.  The full name of the candidate must be 
on all pages of the package.  In addition to the requirements contained in 
reference (a), packages will include: 
    a.  Letter to the board (LTB).  LTB must include board number (found 
below) with branch class in parentheses, i.e. Active Component, SELRES, FTS 
or closed loop.  In the body of the LTB provide Service Members full name, 
work and personal phone numbers and work and personal email addresses. 
    b.  To validate eligibility, all FTS and SELRES candidates (including 
closed loop ratings and FTS serving at active component commands) must obtain 
the Navy Reserve Force Master Chiefs endorsement prior to 
submission.  Candidate packages are due to the office of the Chief of Navy 
Reserve, Force Master Chief no later than 14 December 2021 to ensure 
endorsement and total service calculations are validated in advance of the 14 
January 2022 deadline. 
    c.  Enlisted Personnel Action Request (NAVPERS 1306/7), signed by the 
commanding officer (cannot be delegated) requesting assignment into the 
Command Senior Enlisted Leader (CSEL) Program. In the reason for 
submission/requested action block, the following statement must be included 
(verbatim):  *Respectfully request assignment to the Command Senior Enlisted 
Leader (CSEL) Program.  I understand that if selected, I will be made 
eligible for transfer into a CSEL position as early as 1 October 2022 and not 
later than 31 March 2023.* 
 
4.  Trouble with the file encryption or certificates or any other 
communication errors do not justify a late package.  Verify receipt of your 
package by contacting CMDCM/CMDCS Detailer (PERS-40FF) or FTS CMDCM/CMDCS 
Detailer (PERS-4012C) as applicable. 
 
5.  If unable to send e-mail, candidates may mail packages to the addresses
