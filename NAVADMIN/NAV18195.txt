SUBJ/SURFACE NAVY ASSOCIATION OLD TAR AWARD//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits nominations for the Surface Navy 
Association's (SNA) "Old Tar" Award.

2. The "Old Tar" award was established by the SNA in 1996 to recognize the 
active duty enlisted surface warfare specialist (ESWS) with the earliest date 
of qualification.  The award is a replica of "The Chief" statue which stands 
at the Navy Memorial in Washington, DC.  The statuette is placed on original 
planking from USS Constitution and remains on permanent display at the Senior 
Enlisted Academy.  A plaque contains a description of the award along with 
names of previous and the current "Old Tar."  A replica statuette is awarded 
to the "Old Tar" for display purposes at his/her command.  The replica is 
provided for his/her retention for life with a "very well done."

3. The current "Old Tar is GMCS(SW/EXW) Robert Hyatt.

4. The criteria for the "Old Tar" award is:  active duty ESWS with the 
earliest date of qualification as received by SNA before the announced 
closing date.  Nominees must submit appropriate certified true copies of page 
4 or ESWS certificate.  Nominations received after the closing date that are 
of an earlier date of qualification of the selected award winner will receive 
a letter of recognition only.  In the event of more than one nominee having 
the same ESWS qualification date, the recipient will be determined first by 
the most time at sea, and secondly, by the pay entry base date.  If a 
candidate is qualified in more than one specialty area, their primary 
designation must be surface warfare.

5. The change in custody of the "Old Tar" statuette is recognized at SNA's 
annual symposium held in January in Washington, DC.  The recognition serves 
to renew knowledge of the importance of the award, and as a reaffirmation of 
faith by SNA nationally that becoming an ESWS is, was, and will remain 
important.

6. All nominations will be submitted to SNA at NAVYSNA(at)aol.com or
6551 Loisdale Court, Suite 222, Springfield, VA 22150 no later than
24 August 2018.

7.  Point of contact is LCDR Kelly Craft, OPNAV N81, (703) 693-2509, or via 
email at kelly.craft(at)navy.mil.
