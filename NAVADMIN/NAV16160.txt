RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the ongoing limited duty officer (LDO) and 
chief warrant officer (CWO) sustainability initiative (OSI) which commenced 
in July 2010.  The Chief of Naval Personnel has established off-ramp 
opportunities for specific LDO communities identified in reference (a).  OSI 
off-ramps encourage LDOs in the Information Warfare Community (IWC) and 
Supply Corps to lateral transfer/re-designate into their restricted line (RL) 
and staff corps counterpart designators, establishing clear career 
progression and promotion opportunity congruent with the needs of the Navy.

2.  Beginning in FY-17, there will be zero funded control grade (O4-O6) 
billets for LDOs in the IWC and Supply Corps.  The desired end state is to 
create stable RL and staff corps communities with the accession of LDOs that 
transition to their RL and staff counterpart designators through off-ramps 
per paragraph 3 of this NAVADMIN.  To provide maximum promotion opportunities 
for IWC and Supply LDOs, the following active and reserve component LDO 
designators are identified for off-ramp to corresponding RL/staff 
designators:

    FROM LDO DESIGNATOR (DES)                      TO RL/STAFF DES
    6510  Supply LDO                              3100 - Supply
    6800  Oceanography (OCEANO) LDO               1800  OCEANO
    6810  Information Warfare (IW) LDO            1810  IW
    6820/6825  Information Professional (IP) LDO  1820/1825  IP
    6830/6835  Intelligence (INTEL) LDO           1830/1835  INTEL

3.  Off-ramps will be executed in one of two ways:
    a.  Active component IWC and Supply lieutenant LDOs may voluntarily apply 
for redesignation via the semi-annual lateral transfer and redesignation 
board.  LDOs with four to eight years of commissioned service (YCS) are best 
suited due to career timing considerations.  All applicants must be within 
six months of completing a baccalaureate degree and meet all other 
eligibility requirements outlined in reference (b).
    b.  Active Component IWC and Supply lieutenant commanders, commanders, 
and captain LDOs may voluntarily apply for redesignation without board action 
(WOBA) to their counterpart RL/staff designator, per reference (a).  LDOs in 
this category are encouraged to take advantage of WOBA eligibility to 
maximize future promotion opportunity.  Applicants for WOBA must meet 
eligibility requirements for lateral transfer outlined in reference (b), as 
well as any community specific requirements outlined in statutory promotion 
briefs, convening orders, and program authorizations.  LDOs interested in 
WOBA should contact their respective officer community manager (listed in 
paragraph 6) for further information.

4.  For the most up-to-date lateral transfer application process, visit the 
Enlisted Boards Branch (PERS-803) website at
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/administrative/transferredesignation/pages/default.aspx.

5.  Reserve component IWC LDOs are encouraged to voluntarily apply for 
redesignation via the established change of designator process outlined in 
reference (c).  LDOs with four to eight YCS are best suited due to career 
timing considerations.  IWC reserve redesignation is continuous throughout 
the year and does not culminate in a specific board.  Reserve applicants must 
possess a baccalaureate degree, meet eligibility requirements in reference 
(c), as well as any community specific requirements outlined in statutory 
promotion briefs, convening orders, and program authorizations.
