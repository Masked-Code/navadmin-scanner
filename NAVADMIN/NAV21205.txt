RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN establishes Commander, United States Fleet Forces
(USFF) as the Executive Agent for the Chief of Naval Operations Navigation 
Plan (NAVPLAN) Implementation Framework (NIF), reference (a), task to develop 
an overarching continuum of toughness and mental health support which serves 
from initial accession until a Sailor departs the Navy.
2.  This establishment expands USFFs role as the Office of Primary 
Responsibility for the Navys Culture of Excellence Campaign Line of Effort:
Developing a Lethal Warfighting Force. The expanded task will address 
Institutionalizing Toughness and Resilience by integrating human performance, 
toughness, and resiliency initiatives with mental health care and treatment. 
In this effort, USFF is the supported command, CPF, CNE-A, CNIC, BUMED, Chief 
of Chaplains, NETC, and OPNAV N17 are supporting commands.
3.  USFF is leading a sprint effort now to align, in terms, objectives and 
intent, the Warrior Toughness program in place at Recruit Training Command 
(which will be scaled to all accession sources in FY22), with the roll out of 
Expanded Operational Stress Control (E-OSC), reference (b).
In October 2021, USFF will host an offsite to conduct an initial binning of 
other existing programs and develop an integration strategy that optimizes 
Navys continuum.
4.  By 6 October 2021 and in support of this offsite, USFF, CPF, CNIC, BUMED, 
Chief of Chaplains, NETC, and OPNAV N17 will provide a cataloging of related 
ongoing programs and best practices that could reside within an overarching 
Navy continuum of toughness and mental health support.
Development of this list should include subordinate command inputs and 
include the program name, description and intended outcome. Results will be 
provided to POCs listed in this NAVADMIN. This step of developing a 
comprehensive view of ongoing work across all echelons is key to fielding the 
most impactful continuum for the paragraph 5e stakeholders.
5.  USFF will present the results of this offsite to the Navy Corporate Forum 
through the NIF process. This effort will:
    a.  Set clear time-based targets for continuum outcomes.
    b.  Represent transparent collaboration among all Navy stakeholders.
    c.  Meet all statutory requirements.
    d.  Outline plans to simplify and align the existing portfolio of 
programs.
    e.  Assess any planned or desired continuum through the eyes of three key 
stakeholders:
        (1) The Sailor (who benefits from training and re-enforcement of 
toughness and resiliency skills, as well as a better understanding of 
resources and access to care);
        (2) Command Leadership (from Triad to peer, who benefit from 
understanding the scope of training available, and from receiving training); 
and
        (3) The broader Navy (for alignment and to focus resources and policy 
support)
    f.  Refine the requirement for the numbers and types of professionals 
required to execute the continuum, for consideration in PB23 and POM24.
6.  Per reference (a), Enhancing our culture to better develop tough, 
resilient warriors at sea is the next essential step to our force 
development. The work specified in this NAVADMIN is key to delivering that 
outcome.
