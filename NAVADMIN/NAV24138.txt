RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the guidance for the administration of the 
Fall 2024 (cycle 115) Navy-wide Advancement Exam (NWAE) for Selected Reserve 
(SELRES) E5 and E6 candidates, to include those serving on voluntary recall, 
mobilization, or as canvasser recruiters. 
 
2.  In line with references (a) and (b), the Enlisted Advancement Worksheet 
(EAW) is the authoritative source of all data used to determine cycle 115 
eligibility.  Commands are to accurately validate, complete, and finalize all 
EAWs in the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System.  EAW discrepancies may 
be addressed via the Post-examination Administration Comment (PAC) process 
after cycle 115 worksheets are locked for the cycle. 
 
3.  Cycle 115 Timeline: 
    a.  As required:  Professional Military Knowledge – Eligibility Exam 
(PMK-EE) completion deadline.  In line with reference (c), PMK-EE remains 
mandatory once per paygrade for all E5 and E6 candidates to be eligible for 
NWAE cycle participation.  Refer to reference (d) regarding special 
exceptions for new accessions. 
    b.  1-31 August 2024:  Exam administration. 
    c.  31 August 2024:  EAW completion due date. 
 
4.  Cycle 115 specific eligibility requirements: 
    a.  Terminal Eligibility Date:  E5 and E6 - 1 January 2025 
    b.  Minimum Time-in-Rate (TIR): 
        (1) E6 - 1 January 2022 
        (2) E5 - 1 January 2024 
    c.  E6 candidate TIR requirements for Early Promote (EP) can be waived by 
one year with commanding officer/officer-in-charge approval.  An EAW must be 
created manually for all who receive this waiver.  EP candidates are still 
bound by the same PMK-EE deadline as regular TIR candidates. 
    d.  High-year tenure (HYT) and HYT Plus.  In line with references (e) and 
(f), HYT Plus remains available.  In the EAW, the "HYT Exceeded" entry may 
reflect "Yes" - when applicable, select "Yes" for "HYT Waived". 
    e.  Candidates with an approved request for voluntary transfer to retire 
or Fleet reserve prior to mandated HYT are not eligible to advance. 
    f.  Security clearance requirements.  Ratings requiring a security 
clearance are AC, AE, AG, AO, AT, AWF, AWO, AWR, AWS, AZ,

MA, MC, MMA, MN, ND, OS, QM, SB, SO, STG, STS, and YN.  All NWAE candidates 
must have applicable adjudication (Top Secret or Secret) or Interim clearance 
prior to 1 August 2024.  If clearance is revoked, an exam is not authorized 
until discrepancy corrected. 
An eligibility determination of No Determination Made constitutes an 
unfavorable adjudication. 
    g.  Performance Mark Average (PMA).  Compute PMA for E5 candidates and 
Reporting Senior's Cumulative Average PMA for E6 candidates in line with 
references (a) and (g).  Use all evaluations in current paygrade with an
