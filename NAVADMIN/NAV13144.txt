AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 3590.11F, THE ARLEIGH BURKE FLEET TROPHY/MARJORIE 
STERRETT BATTLESHIP FUND AWARD/USS ARIZONA MEMORIAL TROPHY.// 

RMKS/1. It's an honor to announce the calendar year 2012 Marjorie Sterrett 
Battleship Fund award winners for superior performance in intra-type battle 
efficiency:
A. Atlantic Fleet: USS LABOON (DDG 58)
B. Pacific Fleet: USS STETHEM (DDG 63)

2. Selection for this award reflects the professionalism and dedication of 
these two units.
A. LABOON's performance throughout the competitive cycle epitomizes superior 
performance, operational effectiveness, and consistently high standards of 
readiness as reflected by a short notice sortie in response to the attack on 
the U.S. Embassy in Libya.
B. STETHEM surged on two weeks notice for an eight month deployment to the 
FIFTH Fleet Area of Responsibility (AOR), becoming the first Forward Deployed 
Naval Force ship since 2004 to re-deploy out of the Pacific Command AOR. 
STETHEM maintained peak material readiness during this eight month Ballistic 
Missile Defense deployment.

3. Congratulations to LABOON and STETHEM. Your unmatched dedication and 
professionalism exemplify the highest ideals and spirit represented by this 
prestigious award.
