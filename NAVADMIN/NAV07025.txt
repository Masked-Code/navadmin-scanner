SUBJ/CNO DIVERSITY POLICY// GENTEXT/
REMARKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS (CNO) 
DIVERSITY POLICY.  ALL COMMANDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO READ, UNDERSTAND, AND 
EDUCATE THEIR SAILORS ON THIS POLICY SIGNED BY CNO.
2.  DIVERSITY IS A STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE FOR THE UNITED STATES NAVY.
WE DEFEND THE GREATEST NATION IN THE WORLD.  IT IS A NATION THAT 
WELCOMES, INDEED ENCOURAGES, THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF EVERY CITIZEN 
REGARDLESS OF RACE, GENDER, CREED OR COLOR -- A DEMOCRACY FOUNDED ON 
THE PROMISE OF OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL.  IT IS ALSO A NATION WHOSE 
DEMOGRAPHIC MAKEUP CONTINUALLY CHANGES, REFLECTING THE INFLUX OF NEW 
IMMIGRANTS AND THE GROWTH OF MINORITY POPULATIONS.  THE NAVY MUST 
CHANGE WITH IT.  TO THE DEGREE WE TRULY REPRESENT OUR DEMOCRACY, WE ARE 
A STRONGER, MORE RELEVANT ARMED FORCE.
3.  DIVERSITY IS CRITICAL TO MISSION ACCOMPLISHMENT.  EVERYONE IN OUR 
NAVY CONTRIBUTES TO MISSION SUCCESS AND EVERYONE BRINGS TO THAT 
COLLECTIVE EFFORT UNIQUE CAPABILITIES AND INDIVIDUAL TALENT.  HOW WE 
HARNESS THOSE CAPABILITIES AND FOSTER THAT TALENT BEARS CONSIDERABLE 
EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISH THE MISSION.  LIKE ANY 
ORGANIZATION IN TIME OF CHANGE, WE THRIVE ON THE INFUSION OF NEW IDEAS 
AND THE DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT.  THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE TODAY, WHEN 
UNDERSTANDING THE MORES, CUSTOMS AND IDEALS OF DIVERSE CULTURES, AS 
WELL AS THE PERSPECTIVES OF OTHER PEOPLE, REMAINS CRITICAL TO WINNING 
THE LONG WAR.
4.  DIVERSITY IS A LEADERSHIP ISSUE, AND EVERYONE IS A LEADER.  WE WILL 
PROMOTE AND ENGENDER A CULTURE THAT EMBRACES OUR DIVERSITY.
THROUGH OUR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION, POLICIES, PROGRAMS AND CONDUCT, 
EACH OF US WILL ACTIVELY FOSTER WORK ENVIRONMENTS WHERE PEOPLE ARE 
VALUED, RESPECTED AND PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REACH
THEIR FULL PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL POTENTIAL.   WE WILL RECRUIT,
DEVELOP, EDUCATE AND RETAIN LEADERS FROM AND FOR ALL PARTS OF OUR NAVY 
AND NATION.
5.  WE DEFEND THE GREATEST NATION IN THE WORLD.  THE STRENGTH OF OUR 
DIVERSITY DIRECTLY AND IRREFUTABLY HELPS US DO SO.  THE NAVY WILL STAY 
COMMITTED TO IMPROVING THAT STRENGTH.
