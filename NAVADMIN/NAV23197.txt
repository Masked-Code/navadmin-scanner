RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a) and updates reference (b) in

the Navy Working Uniform (NWU) Type III in the National Capital Region (NCR).

references (b) through (d), is expanded for all Navy personnel while in the 
NCR: 
    a.  The NWU Type III is authorized for wear at all locations in the NCR 
with the exception of the National Mall area bounded by Capitol Hill and 
surrounding Senate and House Staff offices, the White House and Executive 
Office building, Department of State, and all monuments and memorials unless 
specifically authorized for a Joint Task Force National Capital Region (JTF-
NCR) mission.  The NWU Type III is authorized for wear at the Pentagon as the 
alternate uniform of the day except on Fridays. 
    b.  NWU Type III wear is authorized while commuting to and from work 
using privately owned vehicles, government conveyance, public commuter

Wear is also authorized in office environments at headquarters staffs within 
the NCR unless otherwise directed.
