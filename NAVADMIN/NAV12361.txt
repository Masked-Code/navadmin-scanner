REF B IS NAVADMIN 201/11, SEA SHORE FLOW (SSF) ENLISTED CAREER PATHS 
REVISIONS.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE UPDATES TO SEA SHORE FLOW (SSF) ENLISTED 
CAREER PATHS AS ESTABLISHED IN REF A AND REVISED IN REF B.

2.  IN 2008, SSF WAS INTRODUCED AS A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE WAY NAVY 
DEFINED AND MANAGED ENLISTED SEA AND SHORE TOUR LENGTHS.  CHANGES TO THE 
ENLISTED SEA DUTY AND/OR SHORE DUTY BILLET BASE REQUIRE PERIODIC TOUR LENGTH 
UPDATES TO ENSURE PROPER MANNING OF SEA DUTY BILLETS (E.G., MORE SEA DUTY 
BILLETS AND/OR LESS SHORE DUTY BILLETS REQUIRE LONGER SEA TOUR LENGTHS).  THIS 
NAVADMIN REFLECTS THE CONCERTED EFFORT AND RESOURCES THE NAVY HAS APPLIED 
TOWARD BALANCING SSF FOR SEA-INTENSIVE RATINGS.  AS A RESULT OF THE SSF 
BALANCING INITIATIVES (E.G., REGIONAL
MAINTENANCE CENTERS, AFLOAT TRAINING GROUPS, FLEET READINESS CENTERS, FLEET 
REPLACEMENT SQUADRONS, NAVY MUNITIONS COMMAND BILLET ADDS AND GENERAL DUTY 
BILLET REALIGNMENTS) IN-RATE AND OTHER SHORE TOUR OPPORTUNTIES HAVE INCREASED 
WHICH WILL
RESULT IN:

  - IMPROVED FLEET READINESS
  - HIGHER FLEET MANNING LEVELS
  - INCREASED GEOGRAPHIC STABILITY
  - ENHANCED RATING EXPERIENCE LEVELS 
  - GREATER ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES
  - REDUCED DISTRIBUTABLE INVENTORY FRICTION

THE 2011 REVISION TO SSF PROVIDED A COMPREHENSIVE TOUR LENGTH UPDATE FOR MOST 
ENLISTED COMMUNITIES AND REFLECTED THE INCREASINGLY SEA-CENTRIC NATURE OF 
NAVAL SERVICE.  LAST YEAR, THE SSF UPDATE IMPACTED 44 RATINGS AND INCREASED 
THE TOUR LENGTHS FOR MORE THAN 118,000 SAILORS.  THIS UPDATE TO SSF IMPACTS 
0NLY TEN RATINGS AND INCREASES THE SEA TOUR LENGTHS FOR LESS THAN 9,000 
SAILORS.  THE PERSONNEL POLICIES AND MANPOWER SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED TO DATE, 
COUPLED WITH THE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS PROMULGATED IN THIS NAVADMIN, ARE PROJECTED 
TO SIGNIFICANTLY
REDUCE SEA DUTY GAPS IN THE COMING YEARS.  FUTURE UPDATES TO SSF ARE EXPECTED 
TO BE MINOR.  THE FOLLOWING TEN ENLISTED COMMUNITIES ARE IMPACTED BY THIS 
UPDATE (SPECIFIC TOUR LENGTHS ARE LISTED IN PARA 6 BELOW):

RATING    CHANGES FROM 2011 SSF ENLISTED CAREER PATHS
ETSRF     INCREASE SEA TOUR 2 BY 12 MONTHS
MA        DECREASE ALL TOURS TO 36 MONTHS
MMSSW     INCREASE SEA TOUR 2 BY 6 MONTHS
MMSW      INCREASE SEA TOUR 1 BY 12 MONTHS
MT        INCREASE SEA TOUR 2 BY 6 MONTHS
NC        DECREASE SEA TOURS 3 AND 4 BY 12 MONTHS EACH AND
          INCREASE ALL SHORE TOURS TO 42 MONTHS
ND        DECREASE ALL SHORE TOURS TO 36 MONTHS
PS        DECREASE SEA TOUR 2 BY 6 MONTHS
SH        DECREASE SEA TOURS 2 AND 4 BY 6 MONTHS EACH
YN        DECREASE ALL SHORE TOURS TO 48 MONTHS

3.  FOR EASE OF REFERENCE, THE SSF ENLISTED CAREER PATHS ANNOUNCED IN THIS 
MESSAGE APPLY TO ALL ACTIVE DUTY ENLISTED PERSONNEL AND REFLECTS THE SSF 
ENLISTED CAREER PATHS ANNOUNCED IN REF B AS UPDATED IN PARA 2 ABOVE.  HIGH 
YEAR TENURE (HYT) LIMITS REMAIN IN EFFECT.  CURRENT FULL TIME SUPPORT (FTS) 
SEA SHORE ROTATION (SSR) POLICY REMAINS IN EFFECT.

4.  COMNAVPERSCOM MAY ADJUST PROJECTED ROTATION DATES (PRDS) BASED ON LENGTH 
OF TOUR REMAINING.  AS A GENERAL RULE, IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE TURBULENCE IN 
PERSONAL PLANNING, PRDS OF AUGUST 2013 OR EARLIER WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED, UNLESS 
REQUESTED BY THE SAILOR (VIA 1306) OR HIS/HER COMMANDING OFFICER (BASED ON 
UNIT READINESS/DEPLOYMENT NEEDS).  COMNAVPERSCOM IS AUTHORIZED TO ADJUST A PRD 
TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL SEA TOUR EXPERIENCE FOR SAILORS WHO ARE CURRENTLY 
ASSIGNED TO A SEA TOUR.  THIS DECISION WILL BE MADE BASED ON OVERALL MANNING 
IN A RATING/COMMAND, PROJECTION OF FUTURE ROTATIONS TO FILL AT THE NEW PRD, 
AND ENHANCEMENT TO THE CAREER DEVELOPMENT OF THE SAILOR.  COMMANDING OFFICERS 
CAN ALSO REQUEST THAT PRD ADJUSTMENTS BE MADE/NOT MADE BASED ON UNIT READINESS
NEEDS AND IMPACT ON A SAILOR'S CAREER.

5.  SSF ENLISTED CAREER PATHS ARE DEFINED IN PARA 6 BELOW AND SHOULD BE READ

7.  NOTES:
    A.  SAILORS IN SEA-INTENSIVE COMMUNITIES.  SAILORS IN SEA-INTENSIVE 
COMMUNITIES CAN EXPECT TO SPEND MORE THAN HALF THEIR CAREER ON SEA DUTY 
ASSIGNMENT.  SEA TOUR LENGTHS FOR THESE COMMUNITIES WILL NOT INVOLUNTARILY 
EXCEED 60 MONTHS FOR SAILORS WITH LESS THAN 20 YEARS OF SERVICE (YOS) AND 48 
MONTHS FOR SAILORS WITH MORE THAN 20 YOS.  SHORE TOUR LENGTHS BETWEEN SEA 
TOURS WILL BE SET TO 36 MONTHS LONG.  MANNING CONDITIONS AT SEA MAY REQUIRE 
THE NEED TO REQUEST SEA TOUR EXTENSION OR SHORE TOUR CURTAILMENTS TO ENSURE 
ALL SEA DUTY BILLETS ARE FILLED.  SAILORS ARE ADVISED TO CONTACT THEIR 
COMMUNITY MANAGER OR DETAILER FOR INFORMATION ON OR AVAILABILITY OF INCENTIVES 
SUCH AS SEA DUTY INCENTIVE PAY (SDIP) OR VOLUNTARY SEA DUTY PROGRAM (VSDP) FOR 
VOLUNTEERING TO SERVE ADDITIONAL TIME AT SEA.
    B.  INSIDE THE UNITED STATES (INUS)/OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES (OUTUS) 
COMMUNITY.  SAILORS IN INUS/OUTUS COMMUNITIES HAVE SEA SHORE FLOW CAREER PATHS 
BASED ON A FLOW BETWEEN INUS AND OUTUS DUTY ASSIGNMENTS.  ASSIGNMENT TO SEA 
AND/OR OUTUS DUTY (TYPES 2, 3, 4, AND 6) WILL BE CONSIDERED SEA TOURS FOR SEA 
SHORE FLOW PURPOSES.  ASSIGNMENT TO INUS SHORE DUTY (TYPE 1) WILL BE 
CONSIDERED
SHORE TOURS FOR SSF PURPOSES.
        (1)  IT- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BILLET REQUIREMENTS OVERSEAS REQUIRE 
THAT THE IT COMMUNITY FOLLOWS A CAREER PATH BASED ON INUS/OUTUS VICE SSF.  
TOUR ASSIGNMENTS FOR THE IT COMMUNITY WILL BE BASED ON INUS/OUTUS CAREER 
PATHS, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.
        (2)  LN - LEGALMEN HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SEA DUTY (TYPE 2 AND 4) 
BILLETS AVAILABLE FOR ASSIGNMENT.  TOUR ASSIGNMENTS FOR THE LN COMMUNITY WILL 
BE BASED ON INUS/OUTUS CAREER PATHS, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.
        (3)  MA - MASTER-AT-ARMS THAT SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE A FULL TOUR AT A 
STRATEGIC WEAPONS FACILITY (SWFLANT OR SWFPAC) WILL BE GRANTED OUTUS DUTY 
CREDIT FOR SSF PURPOSES ONLY AND WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR INUS/SHORE DUTY 
ASSIGNMENT UPON COMPLETION.  MASTER-AT-ARMS WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A 
DEPENDENT RESTRICTED SEA TOUR ASSIGNMENT TYPE 3 OR TYPE 4 (BAHRAIN ONLY) 
DURING THEIR FIRST OR SECOND SEA TOUR ROTATION.  ADDITIONALLY, SENIOR MASTER-
AT-ARMS MAY BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A SECOND DEPENDENT RESTRICTED SEA TOUR 
ASSIGNMENT DURING THEIR THIRD SEA TOUR ROTATION.  HAWAII IS CONSIDERED INUS 
SHORE DUTY (TYPE 1).  SAILORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT THEIR COMMUNITY 
MANAGER OR DETAILER FOR ADDITIONAL CAREER PATH INFORMATION.
        (4) RP - RELIGIOUS PROGRAM SPECIALISTS HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SEA 
DUTY BILLETS AVAILABLE FOR ASSIGNMENT.  TOUR ASSIGNMENTS FOR THE RP COMMUNITY 
WILL BE BASED ON INUS/OUTUS CAREER PATHS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.
    C.  SHORE-INTENSIVE COMMUNITY.  SAILORS IN SHORE-INTENSIVE COMMUNITIES DO 
NOT HAVE CAREER PATHS DEFINED BY SSF AND CAN EXPECT TO SPEND MORE THAN HALF 
THEIR CAREER ON SHORE DUTY ASSIGNMENTS.  SAILORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT 
THEIR COMMUNITY MANAGER OR DETAILER FOR SPECIFIC CAREER PATH INFORMATION.
        (1)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER SHORE TOUR LENGTHS AT PARTICULAR SHORE 
UICS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE TOWER CLASSIFICATION AND THE TIME FRAME REQUIRED 
TO BECOME QUALIFIED FOR TOWER OPERATIONS.  SAILORS IN THE AC COMMUNITY CAN 
EXPECT TO SERVE MORE THAN HALF THEIR CAREERS IN OPERATIONAL SUPPORT TOURS 
ASHORE.  EVERY EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO ENSURE SAILORS ARE AFFORDED EQUITABLE 
OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE AT SEA TO ENHANCE CAREER PROGRESSION.  SAILORS ARE 
ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT THEIR COMMUNITY MANAGER OR DETAILERS FOR ADDITIONAL
