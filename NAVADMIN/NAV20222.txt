RMKS/1.  In coordination with Fleet Staffs and Fleet Educational 
Services Officers (ESO), the Navy advancement team has developed a 
tailored approach to administering the fall Navy-Wide Advancement Exam 
(NWAE), while ensuring the safety of our Sailors during the
COVID-19 outbreak and maintaining the high standards and continued 
culture of learning that drive our enlisted advancement system.
This NAVADMIN amplifies guidance contained in reference (a) and 
contains exam and cycle administration updates to references (b) and 
(c).  For information on time-in-rate (TIR) eligibility, classified 
rates, exam ordering and other exam information refer to references
(b) and (c).

2.  The following applies to Selected Reserve (SELRES), Active Duty
(AD) and Full-Time Support (FTS) E-4 candidates.  References (b) and
(c) apply.
    a.  Final Multiple Score (FMS) Rank Order for E-4 candidates.
Administration of E-4 (Cycle 107) SELRES and (Cycle 248) AD and FTS 
candidates is cancelled.  The only exception will be for SELRES E-4 
Prior Service Reenlisted Eligibility  Reserve (PRISE-R) candidates who 
must take the exam to make their rate permanent.
    b.  Navy Enlisted Advancement System (NEAS) E-4 candidate records 
(excluding Cycle 107 E-4 PRISE-R candidates) will be established in 
the same manner used for Spring 2020 Cycle 247 E-4 candidates.  E-3 
Sailors eligible to take the fall E-4 Cycle 248 or Cycle 107 exam will 
be given the opportunity for advancement using an alternative FMS 
rank-order method, without inclusion of the exam score from a 
proctored exam.
    c.  Enlisted Advancement Worksheets (EAW).  Since Naval Education 
Training and Professional Development Center (NETPDC) will not receive 
E-4 answer sheets (with the exception of Cycle 107 E-4 PRISE-R answer 
sheets), commands must accurately validate, complete and finalize all 
E-4 EAWs in the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).  
EAW accuracy is critical since NEAS will be reprogrammed to use 
finalized EAWs rather than the candidate exam answer sheets to create 
E-4 candidate records.  The success of this process will be dependent 
upon the accurate completion of E-4 EAWs to establish advancement 
cycle participation.
        (1) AD/FTS Cycle 248 E-4 EAWs must be completed by 25 
September 2020.
        (2) SELRES Cycle 107 E-4 EAWs must be completed by 30 
September 2020.

3.  The following applies to AD and FTS E-5 and E-6 fall 2020 exam 
administrations.
    a.  Administration windows for AD and FTS E-5 and E-6 exams.
These exams will be administered utilizing testing windows in the 
month of September 2020.  E-6 exams will take place from 1 through
16 September 2020 and E-5 exams will take place from 17 through 30 
September 2020.  These testing windows will allow for smaller groups 
of test takers to ensure that adequate social distancing can be 
maintained between testers at testing facilities.  Administration for 
all substitute exams will follow guidelines in references (a) and (c).
    b.  Commands/Personnel Support Activity Exam Execution Plan 
Submission.  In order to ensure appropriate COVID-19 mitigation 
strategies are being implemented, commands will submit their exam 
execution plans to their Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC) for 
approval.  Personnel Support Detachments (PSD) responsible for 
administering exams will submit their execution plans to Navy Pay and 
Personnel Support Center (NPPSC) and to their base commanding officers 
for approval.  Every effort should be made to ensure appropriate 
COVID-19 mitigation measures are in place, to include, but not limited 
to, face coverings, adequate social distancing, available hand 
sanitizer, medical (questionnaire) screenings and temperature checks.
    c.  To the maximum extent practicable, exams for the same ratings 
should be administered on the same day.  Sailors are directed not to 
discuss exam content after taking an exam to ensure no advancement 
candidate is disadvantaged in the advancement process.  Unauthorized 
disclosure of exam content may result in administrative and/or 
disciplinary action.
    d.  Following the administration of exams, it is critical that 
ESOs expeditiously mail in E-5 and E-6 answer sheet packages to NETPDC 
(N321).  Do not hold exams until the end of the testing window.  
Prompt return of answer sheets will help ensure results are released 
in a timely manner.

4.  The following applies to SELRES E-5, E-6 and E-4 PRISE-R fall
2020 exam administrations.
    a.  SELRES E-5 and E-6 and E-4 PRISE-R exam administrations will 
occur from 1 September through 31 October 2020.  Administration for 
all late exams will follow guidelines in references (a) and (b).
    b.  Every effort should be made to spread the administration of 
the exams evenly throughout the two-month period, in order to minimize 
the number of exam-takers at any one administration to ensure maximum 
social distancing.
    c.  Commands/Navy Operational Support Center (NOSCs) Exam 
Execution Plan Submission.  In order to ensure appropriate COVID-19 
mitigation strategies are being implemented, commands will submit 
their exam execution plans to their ISIC for approval.  NOSCs and PSDs 
responsible for administering exams will submit their execution plans 
to either Commander Navy Reserve Forces Command (CNRFC) or NPPSC and 
their base commanding officers for approval.  Every effort should be 
made to ensure appropriate COVID-19 mitigation measures are in place 
to include, but not limited to face coverings, adequate social 
distancing, available hand sanitizer, medical (questionnaire) 
screenings and temperature checks.
    d.  Following the administration of exams, it is critical that 
ESOs expeditiously mail in answer sheet packages to NETPDC (N321).
Do not hold exams until the end of the testing window.  Prompt return 
of answer sheets will help ensure results are released in a timely 
manner.

5.  Results.  All results are anticipated to be released in November 
2020.  Release of results is heavily dependent upon commands 
accurately completing EAWs and promptly processing and returning exam 
answer sheets.

6.  Questions and concerns regarding these policy changes may be 
referred to MyNavy Career Center at askmncc(at)navy.mil or 1-833- 330-
MNCC(6622).
