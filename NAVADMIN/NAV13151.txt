RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance on the use of Microsoft 
Windows XP and all prior versions of Microsoft operating systems.  
Effective 30 April 2014, Microsoft will no longer provide vendor 
lifecycle support (automatic fixes, updates, or online technical
assistance) for Windows XP.  

2.  Per Ref A, all commercial off the shelf (COTS) software in use 
across the Department of the Navy (DoN) shall be vendor supported.  
Per Refs B and C, all products licensed from Microsoft shall be 
supported by, and include, software assurance on an ongoing basis and 
shall be procured per DoN enterprise licensing policy.  Ref D mandates 
use of Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA-256) cryptography to support 
Department of Defense transition by 1 April 2014.  
Transition to Microsoft Windows 7 is a vital component to meet
SHA-256 mandate requirements.

3.  Ashore program managers shall migrate all Navy and Marine Corps 
Intranet, OCONUS Navy Enterprise Network, and Next Generation 
applications to Microsoft Windows 7 or later versions of Microsoft 
operating systems no later than 31 December 2013.  

4.  Ashore program and system managers are prohibited from negotiating 
support contracts with vendors for Microsoft Windows XP and older 
operating systems.

5.  Afloat programs and systems are exempt from the requirements of 
this NAVADMIN until specific afloat guidance is issued SEPCOR.  

6.  Non-vendor supported software:  Ref A provides policy and guidance 
for fielding and support requirements for COTS software.  
All software applications must have vendor support throughout their 
lifecycle.  Commands that have operational requirements for 
applications without vendor, government, or third party support must 
submit a waiver to and receive approval from the DDCIO(N).  Approvals 
will be granted on a case by case basis.  All software waiver requests 
which are not approved will be formally disapproved and recorded in 
DoN Navy Applications and Database Management System within 30 days 
of notification.   Waivers for non-vendor supported applications 
(including Windows 7 compatibility) must include: 

    a.  A detailed overview of the associated system. 
    b.  Description of operational requirement for the unsupported 
        capability. 
    c.  Funding and management plan for maintenance until eventual 
        migration to a supported capability.  

7.  Released by VADM Kendall L. Card, Deputy Chief of Naval 
Operations, Information Dominance, OPNAV N2N6.//
