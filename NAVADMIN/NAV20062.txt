RMKS/1.  The right of every American to vote is a freedom that we in the 
military defend.  Overseas assignment, deployments, and frequent moves are 
facts of life in the Navy that challenge the ability of our Sailors, 
Civilians and their families to exercise that right.  The Navy’s Voting 
Assistance Program (VAP) and Voting Assistance Officers (VAOs) are critical 
resources that enable our Navy team to participate in our democracy and 
ensure their voices are heard.

2.  References a through d established the VAP to ensure eligible voters 
receive information and materials about voting registration and procedures 
including scheduled election dates, offices, constitutional amendments and 
other ballot proposals.  The 2020-2021 Voting Action Plan, an easy-to-use and 
frequently updated reference for VAP officials, is available on the Federal 
Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) website at 
https://www.fvap.gov/vao/directives.  The following guidance pertains to the 
Navy VAP.
    a.  VAOs are the front-line to ensuring Sailors, Civilians and families 
are aware of how to absentee vote and receive in-person assistance.  Duties 
and responsibilities of the VAO are outlined in references B and C.  The 
Voting Action Plan includes a single-source document that succinctly outlines 
all VAO requirements.
    b.  Installation VAOs (IVAOs) are the touchpoint for Navy Region 
Commander and Installation Commanding Officer engagement with all tenant 
command leaders, and are responsible for aggressively advertising information 
for and maintaining installation voting assistance (IVA) offices located in 
close proximity to or on each Navy installation.  IVAOs provide voting 
assistance to Service Members, their dependents, Civilian Federal employees 
and all qualified voters who have access to the IVA Office.
    c.  Recruiting Offices are also designated as voter registration agencies
and can assist personnel and their dependents with voting procedures.  
Detailed guidance for Recruiting Offices can be found in references C and D, 
and on the FVAP website at https://www.fvap.gov/vao/recruiter.
    d.  Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) maintains installation
-specific VAP information, as well as FVAP resources, on public Navy region 
and installation websites and smartphone apps under "Support Services."  
Region and installation websites can be accessed from the public CNIC website 
at https://www.cnic.navy.mil.

3.  Absentee Voter Training.  Navy commands will conduct Absentee Voter 
Training with all hands as soon as possible, but no later than 31 August 
2020, to ensure personnel understand the process for registering to 
participate in the general election.  A training video is available from FVAP 
at https://www.fvap.gov /militaryhowto or 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz1mPEDo1tw. If the training video is not 
accessible, training may be completed using legacy VAO PowerPoint briefs or 
other training methods.

4.  Command leadership and engagement are critical to ensuring our Sailors, 
Civilians and their families have the opportunity to vote, regardless of 
their location or deployment status.

5.  Contact the Navy Service VAO, LT Coulter Lindeke-Heavenrich for questions 
at VOTE(AT)NAVY.MIL or by calling (202) 433-4000.

6.  Released by Mr. Andrew S. Haeuptle, Director, Navy Staff on behalf of 
Vice Admiral M. M. Jackson, Commander, Navy Installations Command.
