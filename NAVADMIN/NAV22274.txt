RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance for the administration of the March 
2023 (cycle 259) Navy-Wide Advancement Exam (NWAE) for Active Duty (AD) and 
Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) to paygrades E-5 and E-6, as 
well as a permanent way forward on Navy-wide advancement to E-4. 
 
2.  Effective immediately, the requirement for all AD and TAR E-4 candidates 
to take the NWAE to compete for advancement to E-4 is permanently eliminated. 
The Navy learned many lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and use of 
Alternative Final Multiple Score (A-FMS) to determine E-4 advancements has 
proven to be an effective metric of overall Sailor quality which places 
increased emphasis on performance.  Moving forward, we will continue to look 
at other methods of advancing Sailors to E-4 that do not involve an exam and 
support Marketplace-based advancement initiatives. 
 
3.  In line with references (a) and (b), the Enlisted Advancement Worksheet 
(EAW) is the authoritative source of all data used to determine E4, E5, and 
E6 Advancements.  Commands are to accurately validate, complete, and finalize 
all EAWs in the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).  EAW 
discrepancies may be addressed via the post-advancement exam administration 
process. 
 
4.  Timeline: 
    a.  31 January 23:  Professional Military Knowledge - Eligibility Exam 
(PMK-EE) completion deadline.  In line with reference (c), PMK-EE remains 
mandatory for all E5 and E6 candidates to be eligible for exam participation 
and for E4 candidates to be eligible for advancement.  Refer to references 
(d) and (e) regarding special exceptions for new accession E-3 and E-4 PMK-EE 
requirements. 
    b.  2 March 23:  E-6 exam administration.  EAW will close one week after 
the exam date on the worksheet. 
    c.  9 March 23:  E-5 exam administration.  EAW will close one week after 
the exam date on the worksheet. 
    d.  31 March 23:  E-4 EAW must be completed. 
    e.  Deviation from administration dates.  In line with reference (a), 
commands that require an expanded window of NWAE administration (with valid 
reason) may request a deviation of NWAE administration from Navy Personnel 
Command (PERS-8).  If authorized, NWAE administration will be completed by 31 
March 23. 
 
5.  Eligibility requirements are found in chapter 2 of reference 
(a).  The following information is specific to cycle 259: 
    a.  Terminal eligibility date:  1 July 23.

    c.  E-6 candidate TIR requirements for early promote (EP) can be waived 
by one year with Commanding Officer or Officer-In-Charge approval.  EAW must 
be created manually for all who receive that waiver.

corrected. 
    f.  Performance Mark average (PMA).  Compute PMA for all candidates and 
in addition, Reporting Senior*s Cumulative Average (RSCA) PMA for E-6 
candidates in line with references (a) and (f).  Use all applicable 
evaluations in current paygrade with an ending date that falls within the 
following periods: 
        E-4 - 1 June 22 to 28 February 23 
        E-5 - 1 December 21 to 28 February 23
