SUBJ/2017 ACTIVE DUTY FUND DRIVE IN SUPPORT OF THE NAVY-MARINE CORPS RELIEF 
SOCIETY//

AMPN/REF A IS SECNAVINST 5340.7, ACTIVE DUTY FUND DRIVE IN SUPPORT OF THE 
NAVY-MARINE CORPS RELIEF SOCIETY//

RMKS/1.  Reference (a) directs all Department of the Navy commands and 
activities with Navy and Marine Corps personnel to conduct an active duty 
fund drive (ADFD) in support of the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society (NMCRS).  
This is our annual opportunity to provide much needed funds for the direct 
benefit of our shipmates and fellow Marines.

2.  NMCRS does not receive any government funding and depends upon the 
support of active duty and retired Sailors and Marines to help those in need 
at home and around the globe.  Our contributions support interest-free loans 
and grants for shipmates facing financial challenges, including those who 
have been displaced by natural disasters, and those who are dealing with 
family emergencies.  Often the financial assistance provided by NMCRS is the 
lifeline that makes a difference for Navy families, and keeps our Sailors 
focused on the mission when an unforeseen financial crisis exceeds their 
ability to make ends meet.

3.  In 2016, nearly 60,000 Sailors and Marines received more than $45 million 
in financial assistance from NMCRS.  Today, Navy families are better prepared 
to address the financial responsibility of marriage, the arrival of new 
family members, and car and home ownership because of the budget counseling 
and financial education provided by NMCRS volunteers.

4.  For more than a century, the society has kept faith with Sailors and 
Marines. The annual march fund drive is our opportunity to give back.  The 
campaign theme, "by our own - for our own" embodies the commitment we have to 
take care of our shipmates.  I am grateful for those who have given 
generously in the past, and confident that, working together, we can achieve 
even more in 2017.

5.  The key to success is assigning motivated fund drive coordinators and key 
people to ensure 100 percent of our Sailors and Marines are afforded the 
opportunity to learn about the NMCRS mission, and the critically important 
programs and services they provide our Sailors and their families.  I 
encourage all who are able to give to consider making a contribution through 
payroll allotment, online credit card, or cash to help those in need - we 
need to take full advantage of this annual opportunity to help our shipmates 
through the 2017 ADFB campaign.
