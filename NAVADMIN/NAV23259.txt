RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and updates the Navy's System 
Authorization Access Request (SAAR) process as directed by references (b) 
through (h).  As part of this process update, this NAVADMIN directs the Usage 
of the Department of Defense (DoD) SAAR Form (DD Form 2875) in place of the 
Navy SAAR-N Form (OPNAV 5239/14). 
 
2.  Policy:  Per references (b) and (c), all Department of the Navy (DON) 
Information Technology users must have an approved SAAR form on file prior to 
being granted access to networks, systems and applications.  In order to 
bring Navy into alignment with the rest of the DoD, all new access requests 
must be completed using the DD Form 2875 no later than 28 February 2024. 
    a.  Commands can continue to use the current approved OPNAV 5239/14  
(REV 9/2011) on file until the SAAR needs to be re-issued or modified. 
    b.  No later than 28 February 2024, all commands must use DD Form 2875 
for initial access requests, re-issuance of access requests, or modification 
of access requests. 
    c.  The differences between the current OPNAV 5239/14 and the DD Form 
2875 changes are noted below and the form is available at 
https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/forms/dd/dd2875.pdf 
        (1) Per reference (e), references to "For Official Use Only" were 
replaced with "Controlled Unclassified Information." 
        (2) Block 19 was changed from "Information Assurance Officer" to 
"Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) or Appointee" per reference (f). 
        (3) Blocks 22 and 22b have been added to identify if the user is 
enrolled in the Continuous Evaluation Deferred Investigation Program and 
enrollment date per reference (g). 
        (4) Block 22c was changed from "Clearance Level" to "Access Level".   
Access level refers to the access determination made based on the user's 
individual need for access to classified information or Controlled 
Unclassified Information to perform official duties. 
        (5) User Agreement.  The Navy User Agreement/Standard Mandatory 
Notice and Consent Provision using general terms and requirements is posted 
on the Department of Navy Chief Information Officer portal 
(https://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs/opnav/n2n6/ddcion/SitePages/Home.aspx), 
but the specific hosting site or system may require a separate form with 
site/system specific specifications. 
        (6) Information System Privileged Access Agreement (PAA) and 
Acknowledgement of Responsibilities.  Users requiring privileged access must 
submit a PAA for the system(s) they require privileged access alongside the 
SAAR.  PAA can be found in reference (d) appendix 2. 
 
3.  SAAR Reciprocity 
    a.  Navy commands and organizations must reuse SAAR forms issued by other 
commands and organizations approving access to any DON networks, systems, or 
applications at the same or lower classification level and need-to-know 
status.  This applies for both permanent changes of station and for temporary 
duties (e.g., Temporary Additional Duty, exercises, deploying, embarkation, 
etc.). 
        (1) Modifications to move accounts within the Navy and reactivate 
disabled accounts due to inactivity do not require a new SAAR form.   
Information System Security Manager (ISSM), ISSO, or Information System 
Coordinator (ISC) will request account movement or reactivation after 
validating the current SAAR form and completion of mandatory training. 
        (2) Users who require access to systems of a higher level of security 
clearance or additional need-to-know requirements than is reflected in the 
existing SAAR form require additional documentation or a new SAAR form. 
    b.  A new SAAR form is required upon change of personnel category status 
(e.g., MIL to CTR, CTR to CIV, MIL to CIV to NAF) and prior SAAR form will be 
updated by the ISSM/ISSO/ISC to request account deactivation to retain 
separation of personal (e.g., CIV, MIL, NAF, CTR, VOL). 
    c.  For reservists who are also employed within the Navy as contractors 
or civilians, one SAAR is required for each personnel category.  This SAAR 
does not require update for each activation. 
 
4.  SAAR Processing 
    a.  For individuals with DoD approved digital signature certificates, 
when possible the initial SAAR must be digitally signed by the account 
requestor, the supervisor level person (supervisor or Information Security 
Officer or ISC or ISSM/ISSO), the security manager, and the validating 
official (system administrator) before the account is provisioned and 
enabled.  The supervisor level signature cannot be the same as the account 
requestor.  If a digital signature is not possible for any of the above, a 
wet signature is acceptable. 
        (1) All signatures on the SAAR form must be within 90 days of the 
signature in Block 11.  Once initial provisioning is complete, original 
signatures on the document will stand for the period prior to the applicable 
expiration. 
        (2) Automated SAAR capabilities will adhere to this signature work 
flow. 
    b.  SAAR forms must have validation documented in the Date Processed 
block of Part IV by one of the following:  the ISSM/ISSO, an ISSM/ISSO 
designee/appointee, or an ISC.  ISSM/ISSO or ISC must perform validation, for 
continued user access, and be documented in the Date Revalidated block of 
Part IV. 
    c.  Once approved, the SAAR form must be retained on file by the command 
ISSM/ISSO or the unit's ISC until one year after the user account is 
terminated.  This includes the initial SAAR form activating an account and 
any subsequent SAAR forms submitted (e.g., modification or deactivation 
requests).  Archive retention requirements for SAARs follow reference (g). 
    d.  Command ISSMs will coordinate the disablement of accounts of users 
who do not complete required training by its required date and maintain a 
non-compliance list of accounts that were disabled. 
    e.  SAAR forms submitted for de-provisioning will have the digital 
signature of either the supervisor, ISC, or ISSM/ISSO. 
    f.  Commands will incorporate their ISSM/ISSO, ISC, or designee into the 
check-out process to ensure timely actions are taken to deactivate accounts 
upon loss of affiliation with the Navy (e.g., End of Active Obligated 
Service, Retirement, End of Contract, End of Employment). 
 
5.  Automated Processing 
    a.  Command developed automated processing, storage and maintenance of 
the approved SAAR forms are authorized but automated work flow, storage, 
processing and management must adhere to the requirements in this NAVADMIN. 
    b.  Total Workforce Management Services is the current DON and Navy 
capability for automated SAAR processing and reciprocity. 
    c.  Naval Identity Services (NIS) will be the mandated Identity, 
Credential, and Access Management solution for the DON.  Systems that are 
integrated with NIS will use the SAAR automated account management process 
for account provisioning and de-provisioning. 
 
6.  Moving forward, Navy will continue to identify efficiencies that can be 
gained in the system access process with the long term goal of moving towards 
only requiring a single SAAR for every user as well as a standardized user 
agreement.  In order to support this, Office of Chief of Naval Operations for 
Information Warfare will establish a Navy-wide SAAR Working Group following 
the release of this NAVADMIN to coordinate process improvements and clarify 
implementation guidelines. 
 
7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until cancelled or superseded. 
 
8.  Released by Ms. Jennifer Edgin, Assistant, Deputy Chief of Naval 
Operations For Information Warfare, OPNAV N2N6.//
