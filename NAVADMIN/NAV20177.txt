RMKS/1.  A key component of the MyNavy HR transformation is delivering modern 
human resources (HR) management technology to simplify processes and make the 
user experience better for Sailors and commands.  This NAVADMIN announces the 
deployment of the automated Navy Department Awards Web Service (NDAWS), which 
is now accessible through BUPERS Online (BOL) as a part of the Navy Personnel 
Command (NPC) Documents Services Workspace.  The automated NDAWS program will 
enable users to electronically initiate, route, endorse and approve all 
Personal Military Decorations (PMD) and unit award recommendations.  Once 
approved, the signed PMD certificate/citation will be uploaded to the NDAWS 
application and will automatically update a Sailors official military 
personnel file (OMPF) as well as mainframe corporate data (i.e.
Officer/Enlisted Summary Record and Performance Summary Record).
Sailors will also be able to search the database for information regarding 
their personal decorations, unit awards and campaign/expeditionary medals.  
All policies that govern PMD and unit awards remain in effect in accordance 
with references (a) and (b).

2.  The NDAWS system update leverages the successful fielding of related HR 
systems that include the electronic submission of selection board documents, 
automated requests for name change and the online officer photograph 
submission form, which are also part of the NPC Document Services Workspace 
on BOL.  All of these processes are proven to be more effective, efficient 
and reliable than their legacy predecessors, and provide considerable time 
savings to users and the NPC staff.

3.  Further contributing to Fleet readiness, commands operating in a deployed 
environment or experiencing internet accessibility or connectivity issues may 
utilize NDAWS without accessing the NPC Document Services Workspace on BOL.  
To utilize this disconnected functionality, a command electronically 
completes the OPNAV Form 1650/3 (Rev 03-20) document, digitally signs it and 
emails it to NPC along with a copy of the signed PMD citation.  The NPC 
Records Section then uploads the completed OPNAV Form 1650/3 document and PMD 
certificate into the system, which automatically updates the OMPF and 
corporate data.  This allows Fleet units that do not have the bandwidth for 
accessing the online application to take advantage of the automation in the 
same way as users with steady internet connectivity.

4.  The new NDAWS User Guide and disconnected functionality compatible OPNAV 
Form 1650/3 can be found via MyNavy Portal Quick Link at 
https://my.navy.mil/quick-links.html under the *U.S. Navy Awards* tab and the 
Navy Personnel Command website under the *NPC* tab .

5.  Points of contact:
    a.  NPC point of contact is My Navy Career Center at askmncc(at)navy.mil 
or call 1-833-6622 or 1-901-874 6622.
    b.  For information on BOL issues call 1-800-951-6289 or e-mail at 
npc_it_service_desk(at)navy.mil.
