SUBJ/246TH CHAPLAIN CORPS ANNIVERSARY MESSAGE// 
 
RMKS/1.  On 28 November 1775, the Continental Congress directed that divine 
services be held aboard all naval ships, thus establishing the Navy Chaplain 
Corps.  For 246 years, Navy Chaplains have cared for Sailors and Marines 
around the globe and through every conflict, at sea and ashore. 
 
2.  Today, the men and women of the Chaplain Corps continue to build and 
sustain the spiritual readiness of our people.  Readiness for the test of 
war is impossible without Sailors and Marines who are ready in body, mind, 
and spirit.  The work of our chaplains and RPs is wholly dedicated to the 
readiness of the spirit. Thank you for your legacy of care to our people. 
 
3.  Happy 246th birthday, Chaplains! 
 
4.  Released by Mr. Andrew S. Haeuptle, Director, Navy Staff on behalf of 
Rear Admiral Brent Scott, Chief of Chaplains.//
