RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES AMPLIFYING GUIDANCE REGARDING THE EXPANSION OF 
THE EIDWS PROGRAM DEFINED BY REFS A THROUGH C.  NAVY CYBER FORCES COMMAND 
(NCF) REVIEWED THE EIDWS PROGRAM AND IDENTIFIED THE LACK OF QUALIFICATION 
OPPORTUNITY FOR SAILORS IN INFORMATION DOMINANCE CORPS (IDC) RATINGS (AG, IS, 
CT, AND IT) ASSIGNED TO COMMANDS NOT UNDER IDC COMMAND ADCON.  TO AFFORD 
MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY FOR IDC ENLISTED PERSONNEL TO ENROLL IN AND COMPLETE EIDWS 
QUALIFICATION IN A WELL ESTABLISHED, CREDIBLE PROGRAM, THE FOLLOWING 
MODIFICATIONS BECOME EFFECTIVE ON THE DATE OF THIS NAVADMIN.

2.  ANY IDC SAILOR HAVING REASONABLE ACCESS TO A COMMAND WITH AN ESTABLISHED 
EIDWS PROGRAM MAY ENROLL IN THAT COMMAND'S PROGRAM.  THIS ADDITIONAL 
OPPORTUNITY FOR EARNING ENLISTED WARFARE QUALIFICATIONS WILL ENHANCE THE 
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF ALL IDC SAILORS AND INCREASE WARFIGHTING 
CAPABILITIES AND CYBER EXPERTISE THROUGHOUT OUR NAVY.  SHIPBOARD PERSONNEL 
ATTACHED TO COMMANDS WITHOUT A PROGRAM MAY ENROLL AND QUALIFY VIA AN APPROVED 
PROGRAM WITHIN THEIR STRIKE GROUP, AMPHIBIOUS READINESS GROUP (ARG), OR TASK 
FORCE.  IF NOT ASSIGNED TO A STRIKE GROUP, ARG, OR TASK FORCE, SHIPBOARD IDC 
PERSONNEL MAY ENROLL AT ANY REASONABLY ACCESSIBLE APPROVED EIDWS PROGRAM.

3.  PRIMARY COMMAND PERSONNEL QUALIFICATION STANDARDS (PQS) AND WARFARE 
QUALIFICATIONS, BASED ON COMMAND FUNCTION, MUST BE OBTAINED PRIOR TO 
AUTHORIZATION TO ENROLL IN AN EIDWS PROGRAM.  QUALIFICATION TIMELINES 
IDENTIFIED IN REF A STILL APPLY.

4.  EIDWS TRAINING COMMANDS WILL TRACK AND REPORT ENROLLMENT AND PROGRESS FOR 
ALL SAILORS (INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TO THEIR COMMAND) ENROLLED IN THEIR 
PROGRAM.

5.  ALL REQUESTS TO ENROLL IN AN EIDWS PROGRAM MUST HAVE THE APPROVAL OF THE 
PARENT COMMAND.

6.  ALL COMMANDS THAT ARE UNDER IDC COMMAND ADCON, OR HAVE MORE THAN
 65
PERCENT IDC MANNING THAT ALREADY HAVE AN APPROVED EIDWS PROGRAM ARE AUTHORIZED 
TO CONTINUE TO EXECUTE APPROVED PQS AND THEIR CURRENT PROGRAM.
THESE COMMANDS ARE AUTHORIZED TO QUALIFY SAILORS IN NON-IDC RATINGS 
PERMANENTLY OR PERSONNEL TEMPORARILY ASSIGNED TO THEIR COMMANDS.

7.  ALL COMMANDS NOT UNDER IDC COMMAND ADCON THAT HAVE LESS THAN 65 PERCENT 
IDC MANNING AND ALREADY HAVE AN APPROVED EIDWS PROGRAM ARE AUTHORIZED TO 
CONTINUE TO EXECUTE APPROVED PQS AND THEIR CURRENT  PROGRAM.
THESE COMMANDS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO QUALIFY NON-IDC RATINGS PERMANENTLY OR 
PERSONNEL TEMPORARILY ASSIGNED TO THEIR COMMANDS.  ONLY IDC PERSONNEL ARE 
AUTHORIZED TO EARN THE EIDWS QUALIFICATION THROUGH COMMANDS THAT HAVE AN 
ESTABLISHED PROGRAM BUT DO NOT MEET THE ABOVE CRITERIA.

8.  COMMANDS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF EIDWS PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT MAY 
CONTINUE WITH PROGRAM CERTIFICATION EFFORTS (SPECIFICALLY CVN, LHD, AND FLEET 
COMMANDS).  COMMANDS INTERESTED IN CREATING AN EIDWS PROGRAM ARE DIRECTED TO 
FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS SET FORTH IN REF A.
