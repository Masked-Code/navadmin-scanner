environmental readiness addressing the legislation, requirements, 
responsibilities, and procedures for all aspects of environmental 
compliance.  Additionally, this policy governs environmental planning, 
conservation, pollution prevention, and remediation for Navy assets and 
activities worldwide.  The environmental readiness program provides 
comprehensive and effective guidance, tools, and training to support 
operational readiness and sustainability in compliance with environmental 
laws, regulations, and executive orders across the Navy enterprise.

responsible manner, with continued access to land, air and sea.  Therefore, 
it is crucial that the Navy is in compliance with all applicable legislation, 
including environmental laws, regulations, executive orders, and Department 
of Defense and Department of the Navy directives, instructions, and 
issuances.  Reference (a) also addresses the importance of proactive 
participation by all impacted parties in environmental planning
