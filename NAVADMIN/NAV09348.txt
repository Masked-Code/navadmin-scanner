SUBJ/NAVY WOMEN E-MENTOR PROGRAM OPEN ENROLLMENT//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD FOR THE 
NAVY WOMEN E-MENTOR LEADERSHIP PROGRAM.  THE NAVY WOMEN E-MENTOR 
LEADERSHIP PROGRAM IS A WEB-BASED MENTORING PROGRAM THAT SUPPORTS THE 
PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF NAVY WOMEN.  THE PROGRAM 
CONNECTS NAVY WOMEN IN A LARGE POOL OF PARTICIPANTS WHOSE DIVERSITY 
ENHANCES THE CONTRIBUTIONS PROVIDED TO PROTEGEES/MENTEES.  PARTICIPANTS 
INCLUDE MEMBERS IN RANKS RANGING FROM ADMIRALS TO SEAMAN RECRUITS, WITH 
A BROAD RANGE OF FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF EXPERTISE.

2.  NOW IN ITS SECOND YEAR, THE NAVY WOMEN E-MENTOR LEADERSHIP PROGRAM 
CURRENTLY HAS 900 WOMEN PARTICIPANTS ENROLLED, INCLUDING 500 MENTORS 
FROM ALMOST EVERY DESIGNATOR AND RATING.  THE PROGRAM HAS AN IMPROVED, 
MORE USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE AND IS ADDING TWO NEW EXCITING FEATURES TO 
THE BASIC ONE-ON-ONE MENTORING OPTION.  THE FIRST IS SITUATIONAL 
MENTORING FOR MENTEES WHO HAVE IMMEDIATE SHORT-TERM SITUATION-SPECIFIC 
NEEDS.
THIS FUNCTION ALLOWS MENTEES TO SELECT ONE OR MORE MENTORS TO ASSIST 
THEM WITH A PARTICULAR SITUATION OR TO POST THE SITUATION, ALLOWING 
MENTORS TO VOLUNTEER THEIR SUPPORT.  THE SECOND NEW FEATURE IS GROUP 
MENTORING IN WHICH A MENTOR POSTS A GROUP-MENTORING TOPIC.  MENTEES CAN 
THEN JOIN THE GROUP AND PARTICIPATE OVER A DESIGNATED TIMEFRAME.  THE 
GROUP MENTOR CAN INCLUDE TELECONFERENCES OR SIMPLY ASK THE GROUP TO 
RESPOND TO HER POSTED DISCUSSION PROMPTS.

3.  THE NAVY WOMEN E-MENTOR LEADERSHIP PROGRAM IS OPEN TO ALL ACTIVE 
DUTY AND RESERVE NAVY WOMEN, TO INCLUDE OFFICERS, OFFICERS-IN-TRAINING 
AND ENLISTED MEMBERS.  UNIFORMED NAVY WOMEN OF EVERY RANK AND RATE ARE 
ENCOURGED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM.  THE OVERALL TIME COMMITMENT 
IS MINIMAL; AN EFFECTIVE ONLINE MENTORING RELATIONSHIP CAN BE 
ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED IN 1-2 HOURS PER MONTH.

4.  MENTORS AND PROTEGEES/MENTEES ARE ENCOURAGED TO ENROLL DURING THE 
OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD ENDING 1 JANUARY 2010.  THERE ARE 700 NEW OPEN 
SLOTS.  INTERESTED PARTICIPANTS CAN REGISTER AT 
HTTP://WWW.ACADEMYWOMEN.ORG/.  WITHIN THREE DAYS OF REGISTERING, NEW 
USERS WILL RECEIVE AN EMAIL INVITING THEM TO LOG ON TO THE E-MENTOR 
PROGRAM SITE TO CREATE PERSONAL PROFILES, INCLUDING AREAS WHERE THEY 
NEED OR ARE WILLING TO OFFER GUIDANCE AND, IF MENTEES, SEARCH FOR AND 
SELECT A MENTOR(S).

5.  THE OFFICE OF WOMEN'S POLICY WILL MONITOR AND ASSESS THE PROGRAM.  
SUCCESS METRICS WILL MEASURE ANY IMPROVEMENT IN ACCESS TO ROLE MODELS 
AND ACCELERATED/EXPANDED PROFESSIONAL NETWORKS BASED ON SURVEY RESULTS 
FROM PROTEGEES.  A SUCCESSFUL EVALUATION FROM MENTORS WILL REFLECT A 
GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF JUNIOR SERVICE MEMBERS, AWARENESS OF ISSUES 
AFFECTING THE NEXT GENERATION OF NAVY LEADERSHIP AND A VALUED 
OPPORTUNITY TO IMPACT THESE RISING LEADERS BY PASSING ON WISDOM AND 
LESSONS LEARNED.
