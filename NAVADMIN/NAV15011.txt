SUBJ/ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NAVAL STRATEGY SUBSPECIALTY 230X//

MSGID/GENADMIN/CNO Washington DC/N3N5/JAN//

RMKS/1. This NAVADMIN announces the establishment of a new subspecialty for 
Naval Strategy (2300/2301) for unrestricted line (URL) officers.

2. In order to enhance our Navy's ability to develop and implement strategy 
and policy while strengthening the connective tissue between our education 
programs and strategy billet assignments, the CNO has created a Strategic 
Enterprise that will:
--Ensure the focused development of Navy Strategy.
--Align Navy Strategic Documents.
--Establish informed linkages between strategy and our budget.
--Coordinate and synchronize strategic messaging and engagement.
--Create a culture of strategic thinking.
--Develop a cadre of Navy strategists.

3. This is a CNO directed program, and our Navy will achieve the Strategic 
Enterprise goals by capitalizing on the abilities, experience, and education 
of our people. Underpinning all of our objectives will be a team of people 
who will execute the efforts of our Strategic Enterprise. One of the key 
lines of effort in this regard is the identification and development of a 
cadre of Navy Strategists.

4. The development of this cadre of Navy Strategists will be enhanced by the 
establishment of a Naval Strategy Subspecialty for those who meet the 
education requirements and/or have appropriate experience tours. There is 
also room for other strategists who lives and breathe strategy but who have 
not yet been given the venues or opportunities to influence our strategy.

5. Specifically, the Naval Strategy Subspecialty will allow for the proactive 
management of personnel serving in key strategy assignments. Subspecialists 
will be given priority for assignments to specialty-coded billets during 
approved community sea/shore rotations to ensure they remain competitive in 
their community for administrative milestones as well as statutory promotion 
boards. This subspecialty seeks to develop top-tier strategy experts over the 
span of a career through strategy/policy development education followed by 
assignments designed to hone the skills in a subspecialty billet during shore 
assignments. This program will enhance our ability to optimize employment of 
subspecialists following participation in programs such as the Federal 
Executive Fellowship (FEF), Pol-Mil Master's (PMM), the Arthur S. Moreau 
(ASM) post-master's study program, Naval Postgraduate School (NPS)
Strategic Studies (688) curriculum, and the Naval War College Advanced 
Studies in Naval Strategy (ASNS). In their experience tours, these officers 
will have the ability to develop and coordinate national, military, and naval 
strategy and policies to evolve concepts and strategy to employ military 
forces from the national through tactical levels.

6. If selected for the Naval Strategy Subspecialty you will have a unique 
opportunity to shape strategy and create the bridge between policy and 
warfighting by serving in a number of unique billets ranging from the White 
House, Interagency, COCOMs, and other critical staffs. In return, you will be 
expected to:
--LEAD the strategic dialogue within our Navy to achieve alignment, strategic 
development, message synchronization, budget integration.
--CHALLENGE assumptions and provide rigorous analysis of options and 
alternatives.
--SHAPE and influence a national vision through expert influence within the 
interagency and Joint arena.
--INFORM leadership using a consistent and aligned set of strategic 
principles, concepts, and tenets.
--SHARE your ideas through discussion and writing to CREATE our strategic way 
forward.
--COMMIT to the challenges inherent in the strategy community and CONTRIBUTE 
throughout your career and while ashore or at sea. If you have the right 
stuff, you can HELP to CHANGE our complex and dynamic world for the better.

7. A strategist subspecialty consists of two key components: education and an 
experience tour. Assignment of the Naval Strategy subspecialty will be 
automatic for officers who have already participated in the Federal Executive 
Fellowship, Politico-Military Master's, and Arthur S. Moreau programs, or 
successfully completed one of the 78 specifically designated N5 or J5 
strategist billets within the Navy, Joint, OSD, State, and COCOM staffs. 
Codes will be assigned based on education and experience. The 2300 code 
denotes education obtained at the Naval War College (Advanced Studies in 
Naval Strategy - ASNS) or via the PMM program. The 2301 code denotes 
education obtained at the Naval Postgraduate School's Strategic Studies (688) 
curriculum. Credit for the 2300 is granted for graduate education at civilian 
institutions when officers complete the required Educational Skills 
Requirements (ESRs) at the Master's (2300P) or Doctoral (2300D) levels. Pre-
approval of proposed curricula is recommended in order to ensure assignment 
of the 2300 subspecialty code. Significant Experience, (2300S) is assigned 
when an officer has successfully completed a FEF tour or one of the 
specifically designated strategist billets. Qualified Strategist (2300Q) is 
assigned when the officer has satisfied the criteria listed for both the 
education (2300P/D) and experience (2300S) tour.
