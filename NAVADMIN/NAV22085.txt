2.  The Navy has a longstanding relationship with the SSAGs of our Nation, 
the Association of Naval Services Officers (ANSO), the National Naval 
Officers Association (NNOA) and the Sea Services Leadership Association 
(SSLA).  These affinity groups have a long and storied history of cultivating 
and preparing our Sailors to achieve great success during their naval careers 
through mentorship and leadership development opportunities, including 
regional and national conferences and symposiums. 
 
3.  Participation and attendance at the SSAG national events is 
encouraged.  Senior Navy leaders and others will be present to engage our 
Sailors on issues facing the Fleet.

the Career Management Branch (PERS-443C) and can be contacted via e-mail at 
pers-443.fct(at)navy.mil.  Subject to the procedures outlined in references 
(a) and (b), pertaining to conference attendance, local commanders are 
encouraged to promote attendance at local SSAG events and use available 
temporary assigned duty funding to facilitate travel to non-local SSAG 
events.
