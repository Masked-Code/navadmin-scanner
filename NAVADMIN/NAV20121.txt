OUTBREAK UPDATE 4.//

RMKS/1.  In coordination with Fleet Education Service Officers (ESO) and with 
assistance from the Fleet Master Chiefs, the Navy advancement team working 
group developed a tailored approach to close out the Spring Navy Wide 
Advancement Exam (NWAE) for both active-duty (AD) and Reserve Sailors.  Our 
primary goal continues to be keeping all Sailors safe and healthy, while 
ensuring every advancement candidate has an equal and fair opportunity to 
advance despite the challenges of the current COVID-19 environment.  This 
NAVADMIN amplifies guidance contained in reference (a) and contains exam and 
cycle administration changes to references (b) and (c).
Additionally, this NAVADMIN cancels and replaces reference (d).

2.  The following applies only to AD and Full-Time Support (FTS)
Sailors:
    a.  E-7 candidates.  These Sailors were able to take their exams before 
COVID-19 mitigation measures were implemented.  The selection board 
eligibility list was published on MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-advancement-center/my-eso.
Additional guidance will be promulgated in a future NAVADMIN, which will 
detail a revised selection board schedule for all chief petty officer boards.
    b.  E-5 and E-6 candidates.  Regular March exams were administered before 
COVID-19 mitigation measures were implemented.
However, approximately 5,000 substitute exams have not been administered.  As 
such, command ESOs will be given 10 working days from 21 May 2020 through 3 
June 2020, to administer substitute exams for these Sailors.  ESOs must 
clearly publish and communicate exam administration schedules so Sailors are 
made aware of testing dates and administration sites in advance of this 
testing window.
Commands should implement precautionary measures to ensure Force Health 
Protection Guidance (FHPG) measures are met in line with reference (e) to 
include social distancing requirements.  This may include providing multiple 
administration sites to reduce the number of, and spread-out, exam-takers at 
each site.  To minimize the risk of Sailor collusion, ESOs are highly 
encouraged to administer exams for like ratings on the same day.  Following 
the completion of substitute exams, ESOs must expeditiously mail all answer 
sheets to the Navy Education and Training Professional Development Center
(NETPDC) in accordance with reference (a).
    c.  E-4 candidates.  There are approximately 20,000 exams that were not 
administered due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.  Reference (d) rescheduled the E-4 
exam to 21 May 2020, however, execution of the exam in May presents high risk 
to the force.  Due to the large number of Sailors eligible to participate in 
this exam and the added difficulty of administering the exam to all of these 
Sailors while implementing FHPG measures, the Navy has determined that it is 
in the best interest and safety of our Sailors to NOT administer the E-4 
exam.
        (1) As an alternative, those Sailors who were eligible to take the 
Spring E-4 Cycle 247 exam will have the opportunity for advancement using the 
rank-order method, a performance-based system that will use current standard 
Final Multiple Score (FMS) factors without inclusion of an exam score.  With 
the elimination of the exam score the Performance Mark Average will be the 
dominant factor in determining advancement.  FMS factors include the 
following:

Traditional FMS		Rank-Order FMS
Points	%		Points	%
Performance Mark Avg.	64		38%		64		72%
Standard Score		80		47%		0		0%
Awards			10		6%		10		11%
Pass not Advance		9		6%		9		10%
Service In Paygrade	2		1%		2		2%
Education			4		2%		4		5%
Maximum FMS			169		100%		89		100%

This alternate FMS method provides eligible E-4 candidates opportunity for 
advancement this cycle.
        (2) To accurately determine the population of E-4 candidates eligible 
for advancement using the rank-order method, command ESOs MUST complete all 
Enlisted Advancement Worksheets (EAW) in the Navy Standard Integrated 
Personnel System (NSIPS).  EAW accuracy is particularly important since 
traditionally, NETPDC uses the candidate exam answer sheet to create a 
candidate record and establish the advancement eligible population.  However, 
with exam cancellation, NETPDC will not receive answer sheets and will rely 
on the completed EAW to establish advancement eligibility.
        (3) Currently, there are approximately 35,000 unfinished EAWs in 
NSIPS, which require immediate action by command or regional ESOs (for those 
units unable to access NSIPS).  ESOs are directed to adjudicate all EAWs to 
reflect the correct eligibility status for their respective Sailors before 21 
May 2020 in order to have their records reviewed for the Spring exam (Cycle 
247).  Command leadership should ensure this process is completed by 21 May 
2020 to afford eligible candidates consideration for advancement.

3.  The following applies only to Selected Reserve (SELRES) Sailors:
    a.  E-4 through E-7 candidates.  Approximately 83% of all Cycle
106 exams were administered during the NWAE in February 2020.
However, close to 3,000 late exams were not administered due to the
COVID-19 Pandemic.  As such, command ESOs are authorized to test from 1-31 
July 2020 since testing for SELRES is dependent on drill weekends, available 
test sites and candidate availability.
Following the completion of late exams, ESOs must expeditiously mail answer 
sheets to NETPDC.
        (1) SELRES E-7 candidates are highly encouraged to participate in the 
exam at the earliest possible date in July 2020 to ensure selection board 
eligibility results can be posted prior to the board convening date.
        (2) Due to Cycle 106 exam delays, all SELRES E-7 candidates will have 
an additional three weeks to submit a Letter to the Board (LTB).  The new due 
date for LTB submissions will be 18 May 2020, which correlates to the 
original convening of the Reserve E-7 board.
While FTS E-7 board eligibility has already been published, SELRES
E-7 has not.  Consequently, all SELRES E-7 candidates are encouraged to 
submit a LTB prior to the 18 May due date, if desired, just in case they 
become eligible for the SELRES E-7 board following the publishing of board 
eligibility.  An LTB is not required and should not include information 
already available within the Official Military Personnel File of a Sailor.
    b.  ESOs are responsible for ensuring examination dates on the EAW are 
changed for the approved late examination administrations.

4.  Advancement Results.  Release of E-4 through E-6 AD/FTS advancement 
results is anticipated as early as July 2020.  SELRES E-4 through E-6 
advancement results and E-7 selection board eligibility results can be 
expected in late August.  Results are heavily dependent on commands promptly 
processing and returning answer sheets.

5.  EAW system change.  A system change was made to the Cycle 247 (March 
2020) E4 EAW, setting the new examination administration date to 21 May 2020.  
Regardless of when the actual exam is administered, ESOs will have until 21 
May 2020 to finalize E-4 Worksheets.  For SELRES Cycle 106, ESOs are 
responsible for ensuring examination dates on the EAW are changed for the 
approved late examination administrations.  No Sailors will gain eligibility 
for advancement due to the delay/cancellation of exams.

6.  Questions and concerns regarding these policy changes may be referred to 
MyNavy Career Center at askmncc(at)navy.mil or 1-833- 330-MNCC (6622).
