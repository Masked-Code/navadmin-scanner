SUBJ/MILITARY FAMILY APPRECIATION MONTH// 
REMARKS/1.  NOVEMBER MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON, AND IT 
IS ALSO NATIONAL MILITARY FAMILY APPRECIATION MONTH.  AS WE CELEBRATE 
THE HOLIDAYS WITH OUR FAMILIES, WE SHOULD ALL TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK 
ABOUT ALL THEY DO AS PART OF OUR GREAT NAVY, AND THANK THEM FOR THEIR 
SUPPORT.
2.  TODAY, THE UNITED STATES NAVY - OUR SAILORS, NAVY CIVILIANS, AND 
FAMILY MEMBERS - IS THE MOST POWERFUL NAVY IN THE WORLD.  WE ENSURE 
MARITIME FREEDOM THAT IS THE BASIS FOR GLOBAL PROSPERITY, AND WE 
PROMOTE SECURITY AND STABILITY AROUND THE GLOBE.  WE ARE COMMITTED TO 
PREVENTING WAR, BUT ARE ALWAYS READY TO FIGHT AND WIN.  
OUR NAVY'S STRENGTH IS REINFORCED BY THE UNFLAGGING SUPPORT OF OUR NAVY 
FAMILIES.  OUR FAMILIES SHARE BOTH THE SUCCESSES AND THE SACRIFICES OF 
SERVICE.  OFTEN THEY SEE OPPORTUNITY WHERE OTHERS SEE ONLY CHALLENGE.  
THEIR COMPASSION AND SUPPORT MAKE EACH OF US, AND THE NAVY IN WHICH WE 
SERVE, BETTER PREPARED TO ANSWER THE CALL OF DUTY AT HOME AND ABROAD.  
3.  THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AND ESPECIALLY THIS MONTH, I ASK ALL SAILORS 
AND NAVY CIVILIANS TO JOIN ME IN EXPRESSING OUR HEARTFELT APPRECIATION 
TO OUR NAVY FAMILY MEMBERS.
