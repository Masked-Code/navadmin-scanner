SUBJ/FY-18 FULL-TIME SUPPORT AVIATION COMMAND RETENTION BONUS//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the continuation of the Full-Time Support 
(FTS) Aviation Command Retention Bonus (ACRB).  The FTS ACRB is designed to 
retain those officers with the talent and command experience in our primary 
warfighting missions critical to the future of our institution.

2.  FTS ACRB applicants must be screened as a commanding officer
(CO) of an eligible operational (OP), operational training (OP-T), or special 
mission (SM) commander (CDR) command in order to apply.
Eligible commands are those OP, OP-T and SM CDR commands for which the annual 
Aviation Command Screen Board selects officers to serve as COs.  Aviators who 
screened for command on the FY17 and FY18 FTS Aviation Command Screen Board 
are eligible to apply upon release of this NAVADMIN.  Eligibility to apply 
ends 31 August 2018.  Aviators who screened for command on the FY15 or FY16 
Aviation Command Screen Board, and took command after 1 October 2017, are 
eligible for this FTS ACRB program.

3.  COs and post command CDRs (PCC) not on contract, who are serving or 
served as CO of an eligible OP, OP-T or SM CDR command in FY18, are eligible 
to apply for ACRB under the FY18 FTS ACRB program.
Signed contracts must be received by PERS-46 by 31 August 2018.

4.  COs who were in command in FY17 and accepted the FY17 ACRB, are eligible 
to renegotiate for the terms and conditions of the FY18 ACRB program.  The 
new service obligation incurred from renegotiation will begin upon the date 
of renegotiated contract acceptance by PERS-46.  The renegotiated contract 
will be the difference of $100,000 and any payments from the previous ACRB.  
In no case will a member receive more than $100,000 in ACRB payments between 
the two contracts.

5.  All FY18 FTS ACRB contracts will be worth $100,000.  All eligible 
officers will receive an initial payment of $34,000 and two anniversary 
payments of $33,000.  Participation in the FY18 FTS ACRB obligates 
contractees to 3 years of obligated service to include full completion of a 
PCC tour, which may be between 24 and 36 months depending on assignment.  For 
members who sign a contract before 19 YCS, the ACRB obligation ends at the 
completion of 22 YCS or projected rotation date (PRD) of the assigned PCC 
tour, whichever is later.  For members who sign after 19 YCS, the obligation 
shall be 3 years from contract approval or PCC PRD, whichever is later.
