SUBJ/SUICIDE PREVENTION PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT CONTEST//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE NAVY'S PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT (PSA) 
VIDEO CONTEST TO EMPHASIZE SUICIDE PREVENTION AS AN ALL HANDS EVOLUTION.  THIS 
YEAR'S TOPIC WILL PROMOTE THE CORE MESSAGE "IT'S OKAY TO SPEAK UP WHEN YOU'RE 
DOWN."

2.  CONTEST ENTRY DETAILS WILL BE RELEASED LATER THIS MONTH, INCLUDING 
SUBMISSION DEADLINES.  THE WINNING PSA VIDEOS WILL BE ANNOUNCED AND AVAILABLE 
FOR VIEWING IN OCTOBER AFTER SUICIDE PREVENTION AWARENESS MONTH.  THIS IS A 
CREATIVE AND ENERGIZING WAY TO ENGAGE OUR SAILORS, CONNECT WITH THE COALITION 
OF SAILORS AGAINST DESTRUCTIVE DECISIONS EFFORTS, AND SPOTLIGHT INDIVIDUAL 
COMMAND SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAMS.  I URGE LEADERSHIP TO PROMOTE THIS 
CONTEST, ENCOURAGE INDIVIDUAL AND COMMAND SUBMISSIONS, AND CONSIDER LOCAL 
RECOGNITION OF OUTSTANDING EFFORTS.  ALL SAILORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE 
IN THE CONTEST BY VOTING ONLINE FOR THE BEST PSA ENTRY THAT ADVOCATES SEEKING 
HELP DURING STRESSFUL TIMES.  VOTING WILL BE HELD 17-21 SEPTEMBER 2012.  
SAILORS CAN VIEW THE SUBMITTED ENTRIES AND CAST THEIR VOTES BY ACCESSING 
WWW.SUICIDE.NAVY.MIL (ALL LOWER CASE LETTERS).

3.  AT THE CORE OF NAVY'S SUICIDE PREVENTION EFFORT IS THE DESIRE FOR SAILORS 
TO ACT (ASK, CARE, TREAT).  IF A SAILOR NOTICES A SHIPMATE IS STRUGGLING WITH 
LIFE CHALLENGES, IT'S TIME TO "SPEAK UP" AND ACT.
ASK IF SOMEONE IS THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE, LET THEM KNOW YOU CARE, AND GET THEM 
TREATMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  SHIPMATES ACT FOR SHIPMATES.
AS SUCH, SUICIDE PREVENTION PSA CONTEST ENTRIES SHOULD REFLECT THE CORE 
MESSAGE "IT'S OKAY TO SPEAK UP WHEN YOU'RE DOWN" AND ENCOURAGE SHIPMATES TO 
BREAK DOWN BARRIERS BY PROMOTING THE FACT THAT SEEKING HELP IS A SIGN OF 
STRENGTH AND THAT SAILORS CAN HELP PROVIDE EACH OTHER WITH HOPE.  LIFE COUNTS!
