RMKS/1.  THE CNO SAILING DIRECTIONS GUIDE US TO SUPPORT WARFIGHTING FIRST, 
OPERATE FORWARD AND TO BE READY.  TO SUPPORT THESE CNO SAILING DIRECTIONS, 
NAVY HAS CREATED A VOLUNTEER SEA DUTY PROGRAM FOR HIGHLY TRAINED AND MOTIVATED 
SAILORS TO FILL CRITICAL BILLETS AT SEA IN SUPPORT OF OUR GLOBAL MISSION.  
VOLUNTEERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO EXTEND THEIR ENLISTMENT IN THEIR CURRENT SEA DUTY 
BILLET BEYOND THEIR PRESCRIBED SEA TOUR (PST), TO TERMINATE SHORE DUTY EARLY 
AND ACCEPT NEW ORDERS TO A SEA DUTY BILLET, OR TO ACCEPT BACK-TO-BACK (B2B) 
SEA DUTY ORDERS BEYOND NORMAL SEA/SHORE FLOW LIMITS.  SAILORS ACCEPTED INTO 
THIS VOLUNTARY SEA DUTY PROGRAM WILL BE ABLE TO DEFER THEIR PERFORM-TO-SERVE 
(PTS) WINDOW TO THE MINIMUM OBLISERV FOR THE ORDERS NEGOTIATED, TYPICALLY AT 
LEAST TWO YEARS.  ADDITIONALLY, VOLUNTEERS WILL BENEFIT FROM GEOGRAPHIC 
CHOICE/STABILITY FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY.  THIS PROGRAM IS OPEN TO ALL 
RATINGS AND ALL PAYGRADES SUBJECT TO ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS 
DISCUSSED BELOW. REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED UNTIL 30 SEPTEMBER 2012.

2.  EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY:  PER REFS B AND C, INTERESTED SAILORS MAY SUBMIT A 
NAVPERS 1306/7 REQUEST TO EXTEND ON SEA DUTY, CURTAIL SHORE DUTY EARLY, OR 
REQUEST B2B SEA DUTY.  THE SEA DUTY ASSIGNMENT MAY BE ONBOARD SHIPS, SQUADRONS 
AND OTHER TYPE 2/3/4 ACTIVITIES.  VOLUNTEERS WILL BE ASSIGNED TO SEA DUTY 
COMMANDS WITHIN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AS THE CURRENT SHORE DUTY COMMAND 
IF AVAILABLE AND REQUESTED.  OUT OF AREA MOVES WILL BE CONSIDERED IF THE 
SAILOR HOLDS A CRITICAL NEC OR REQUESTS A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION.  FTS 
SAILORS WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR ASSIGNMENT TO VALID USN REQUISITIONS.

3.  ALL REQUESTS, REGARDLESS OF COMMAND RECOMMENDATION, WILL BE FORWARDED TO 
COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-40) FOR DISPOSITION.  REQUESTS WILL BE REVIEWED TO ENSURE 
EARLY TRANSFERS WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE SAILOR'S CURRENT COMMAND.  
WHEN THE COMMAND DOES NOT SUPPORT A REQUEST AND IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE 
SAILOR'S SKILLS ARE IN CRITICAL NEED IN THE FLEET THE REQUEST WILL BE 
FORWARDED TO PERS-40 FOR FINAL ADJUDICATION AFTER COORDINATION WITH THE 
MANNING CONTROL AUTHORITY (MCA).  LOSING COMMANDS MAY APPEAL TO THEIR 
RESPECTIVE MCA VIA THEIR BSO/TYCOM.

4.  PROCESS FOR SAILORS CURTAILING SHORE DUTY OR REQUESTING B2B SEA DUTY.
UPON RECEIPT OF THE NAVPERS 1306/7, THE RATING DETAILER WILL REVIEW SAILOR 
ELIGIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAM AND IF ELIGIBLE, CONTACT THE SAILOR AND DIRECTLY 
NEGOTIATE WITH THE SAILOR USING THE CURRENT MONTHS REQUISITIONS.  SAILORS WILL 
BE ALLOWED TO SELECT FROM JOBS CURRENTLY ADVERTISED ON CMS/ID WITHOUT 
APPLICATIONS OR, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH PERS-4013, OTHER HIGH PRIORITY JOBS 
IN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF INTEREST. IF NO AGREEMENT CAN BE MADE WITHIN 2 
REQUISITION CYCLES, THE REQUEST WILL BE RETURNED DISAPPROVED.  IF A JOB 
ASSIGNMENT IS AGREED TO BY ALL CONCERNED, THE DETAILER WILL COORDINATE THE 
TRANSFER DATE TO OPTIMIZE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AND MEET THE REQUISITION FILL 
DATE.  IN ALL CASES WHERE PCS ORDERS ARE REQUIRED, THE ORDERS WILL BE WRITTEN 
FOR THE ENTIRE PRESCRIBED SEA TOUR AND A SHORT TERM EXTENSION ON THE CURRENT 
ENLISTMENT WILL BE USED TO COMPLETE THE MINIMUM ACTIVITY TOUR.  THIS SHORT 
TERM EXTENSION WILL NOT REQUIRE A PTS QUOTA.
SAILORS WILL BE REQUIRED TO APPLY FOR A PTS QUOTA TO COMPLETE THE TIME 
REMAINING FOR A FULL SEA TOUR.

5.  SHORT TERM EXTENSION (STE) INFORMATION.  STE INCREMENTS OUTLINED IN REF A 
ARE WAIVED FOR THIS PROGRAM, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.  SAILORS CURRENTLY IN SEA 
DUTY ASSIGNMENTS MUST EXTEND BEYOND THEIR PST FOR A MINIMUM OF 12 MONTHS, BUT 
NOT TO EXCEED 24 MONTHS.  SAILORS TERMINATING SHORE DUTY EARLY TO GO TO SEA 
MAY EXTEND FOR 12 TO A MAXIMUM OF 36 MONTHS PROVIDED  THEY EXACTLY MATCH THE 
MINIMUM OBLISERV REQUIRED FOR THE ORDERS ACCEPTED (12 MONTHS UNACCOMPANIED FOR 
TYPE 3 DUTY OCONUS, 24 MONTHS FOR CONUS OR QQQQ UNACCOMPANIED OCONUS, OR 36 
MONTHS ACCOMPANIED OCONUS).  FOR EXAMPLE, A SHORE-DUTY SAILOR WITHIN 5 MONTHS 
OF EAOS WOULD HAVE TO EXTEND FOR 31  MONTHS TO OBTAIN OCONUS ORDERS.
