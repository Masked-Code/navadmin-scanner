RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces modifications to references (a) and (b) 
regarding grooming and evaluation requirements for Sailors diagnosed with 
Pseudofolliculitis Barbae (PFB).  These modifications are based on a periodic 
review of references (a) and (b) by Navy dermatologists, the Navy Uniform 
Matters Office (OPNAV N13X) and recommendations provided by waterfront 
leadership and Sailors diagnosed with PFB. 
 
2.  PFB is caused when tightly curled beard hairs, sharpened by shaving, 
curve back and re-enter the skin, resulting in facial inflammation, bumps and 
infections. 
 
3.  The following PFB policy changes and management requirements are 
effective immediately 
    a.  In line with reference (c), Sailors diagnosed with PFB and authorized 
facial hair may optionally outline/edge their beards. Discontinue 
outlining/edging of beards if doing so results in skin irritation or causes 
an outbreak. 
    b.  Sailors diagnosed with PFB are no longer required to maintain a copy 
of a facial hair waiver on their person.  The required source of 
documentation is the Sailors medical record.  Sailors have the option to 
maintain a copy of their waiver treatment form on a personal portable 
electronic device or a paper copy for convenience in situations such as 
embarking a ship or temporary duty assignments where medical records may not 
be immediately available. 
    c.  PFB treatment failures will not be considered for administrative 
separation from the Navy.  Sailors found to be willfully non-compliant or 
that refuse to comply with prescribed PFB medical treatments or commanding 
officers shaving requirements may be subject to administrative separation. 
    d.  Laser hair reduction treatments are optional and must be agreed upon 
by the PFB diagnosed Sailor. 
    e.  Temporary waivers for PFB medical treatment periods are expanded from 
60 to 90 days or as prescribed by the attending military medical care 
provider. 
    f.  Evaluations for PFB diagnosed Sailors found to be unresponsive to 
medical or laser treatments is expanded to occur every two years vice 
annually unless more frequent evaluations are required by a military medical 
care provider. 
 
4.  Maintain a copy of this NAVADMIN until all policy changes are 
respectively reflected in references (a) and (b). 
 
5.  Questions and comments regarding this NAVADMIN should be addressed to Mr. 
Robert B. Carroll, OPNAV N13X, at robert.b.carroll3.civ(at)us.navy.mil or
