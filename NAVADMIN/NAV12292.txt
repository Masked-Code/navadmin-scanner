DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA).  FSSA IS CURRENTLY PAYABLE AT A RATE NOT TO 
EXCEED $1,100.00 PER MONTH.

HOWEVER, AT LEAST ONE MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD MUST BE A MILITARY DEPENDENT.  
INCOME LIMITS ARE UPDATED ANNUALLY ON 1 OCTOBER AND POSTED AT

3.  IF AN ELIGIBLE MEMBER IS RECEIVING FEDERAL BENEFITS UNDER THE SUPPLEMENTAL 
NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (SNAP), THE AMOUNT OF THE FSSA ENTITLEMENT WILL 
BE 
EQUAL TO THE CALCULATED FSSA OR THE SNAP ALLOTMENT, WHICHEVER IS HIGHER, NOT 
TO 
EXCEED THE $1,100 LIMIT.  DETAILED INFORMATION ON ELIGIBILITY REQUREMENTS CAN 
BE
