RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN extends reference (a) and announces the policy and 
guidance for Calendar Year (CY) 2024 season two Meritorious Advancement 
Program (MAP) for Active Duty (Active Component and Training and 
Administration of the Reserve (TAR)) Sailors.  MAP season two runs from 15 
September through 15 October 2024.  This season continues the added preseason 
window for commands to verify user hierarchies and Unit Identification Code 
(UIC) assignments ahead of the season.  The timeline in paragraph 3 contains 
details. 
 
2.  MAP quotas are distributed over two seasons during CY24, with roughly 
half of the available MAP quotas allocated for each of two MAP seasons during 
the year.  This aligns MAP with the Navy-wide Advancement Exam (NWAE) to 
ensure any unused MAP quotas are included in the NWAE cycle and to emphasize 
the intent of MAP to select and reward top-performing Sailors.  To meet 
required Time-In-Rate (TIR) for MAP advancement eligibility, Sailors must 
have a date of rank no later than the following: 
    a.  E5:  1 July 2023 
    b.  E5 (Nuclear-Trained Sailors):  1 July 2022 
    c.  E4:  No TIR requirement 
    d.  E3 and junior:  There will be no MAP to E2 through E4 this year in 
order to support transition to time-in-service based advancements to E2 
through E4 in line with reference (b). 
 
3.  Timeline: 
    a.  MAP Pre-season:  1-12 September 2024.  Budget Submitting Office 
Quotas will be promulgated separate coordination for planning purposes. 
    b.  MAP Quotas Uploaded:  13 September 2024. 
    c.  CY24 MAP Season 2:  15 September - 15 October 2024. 
 
4.  In line with references (c) through (f), MAP advancement is not 
authorized for Sailors that participate within Detailing Marketplace 
Assignment Policy (DMAP).  DMAP ratings not authorized for MAP are ABH2, 
ABF2, GSM2 CS2, MM2, IC2, DC2, RS2, ABE2, AME2, EM2, QM2, AO2, GM2.  Sailors 
in these ratings have advancement opportunities via Command Advance to 
Position (CA2P).  Additional details are located on the MyNavy HRs DMAP 
website, https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
Management/Detailing/Enlisted/Detailing-Marketplace/. 
 
5.  Commands are required to have two Navy Standard Integrated Personnel 
System (NSIPS) MAP user roles (command reviewer and command reporting senior) 
in order to submit MAP advancements, Exceptions to Policy (ETP) and 
additional MAP quota requests through NSIPS.  NSIPS Web Afloat users and 
commands without access to NSIPS should refer to paragraph 5a for 
instructions on submitting their MAP advancements.  The system uses 
authoritative data to determine eligibility.  However, commands are required 
to locally validate that MAP candidates have successfully completed the 
Professional Military Knowledge Eligibility Examination (PMK-EE) requirement 
for E5 and E6 MAP advancements prior to the first day of the MAP season (15 
September 2024) as line with in reference (c).  For training on user roles, 
log into NSIPS via https://www.nsips.navy.mil/, click on training tab, then 
click "MAP tutorial (JPA)". 
    a.  NSIPS Web Afloat users and commands without access to NSIPS must 
submit a MAP nomination request via e-mail directly to their Immediate 
Superior in Charge (ISIC), Type Commander (TYCOM) or Budget Submitting Office 
(BSO)/echelon II command using the Meritorious Certification Letter (MCL). 
The letter must be signed by the Commanding Officer and should 
address any ETP and/or additional quotas requested.  Sample MCLs and detailed 
information regarding the offline process can be found via MyNavy Portal 
(MNP) at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-promotion/a-enlisted-  
advancement-resources-and-links, then select the *Websites* tab in the blue 
banner, then select the MAP homepage. 
    b.  Quota usage, modifications, and distribution will be managed within 
the NSIPS environment.  BSO and command quotas will be uploaded into NSIPS on 
13 September 2024 and can be found under the quota summary report tab. 
Quotas can also be found via the MyNavy HR website: 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Enlisted-Career-Admin/Advancement/MAP/. 
    c.  Additional quotas can be requested using the quota request option by 
the command reviewer user role.  Commands must contact their BSO to determine 
timeline for additional quota requests. Whether or not command quotas are 
authorized, all commands have the opportunity to request quotas from their 
BSO/echelon II command, via their ISIC and TYCOM. 
    d.  NSIPS will automatically determine if an ETP is required using 
predetermined criteria.  Sailors in ratings requiring security clearances and 
rates/pay grades requiring TIR waivers will be automatically routed for 
adjudication.  The request will be routed through the ISIC, TYCOM, and 
BSO/echelon II command using a hierarchical workflow. 
    e.  NSIPS will not automatically generate an ETP for Nuclear-trained 
Sailors.  Commands desiring to advance a nuclear-trained Sailor not meeting 
the TIR requirement must send notification to the Nuclear Enlisted Community 
Manager (N133D) at bullnuke@navy.mil.
