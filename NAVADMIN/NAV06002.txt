GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THE POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR SAILORS TO
DESIGNATE A PERSON AUTHORIZED TO DIRECT DISPOSITION (PADD) OF

2.  ALL COMMANDS ARE DIRECTED TO INFORM SAILORS THAT THEY HAVE THE
OPTION TO DESIGNATE A PADD IN THE REMARKS PORTION OF THE RECORD OF
EMERGENCY DATA DD FORM 93 AND/OR NAVPERS 1070/602.  DEPLOYING UNITS

DESIGNATE A PADD, THE CURRENT PRIMARY NEXT OF KIN (PNOK) LISTED ON
THE DD FORM 93 OR NAVPERS 1070/602 WILL AUTOMATICALLY DEFAULT AS THE

DESIGNATED TO DIRECT DISPOSITION OF REMAINS:  THE SURVIVING SPOUSE;
BLOOD RELATIVES; ADOPTIVE RELATIVES; OR A PERSON STANDING IN
LOCO PARENTIS TO THE DECEDENT.  DODI 1300.18 STATES THE PERSON MOST
CLOSELY RELATED TO THE DECEDENT IS CONSIDERED PRIMARY
NEXT-OF-KIN (NOK) FOR DISPOSITION OF REMAINS, DISPOSITION OF
PERSONAL EFFECTS, AND THE RELEASE OF RECORDS AND OTHER INFORMATION
TO SECONDARY NOK AND THIRD PARTIES.  AN UNREMARRIED SURVIVING SPOUSE
IS CONSIDERED PRIMARY NOK.  OTHER NOK AND INTERESTED PARTIES ARE
RECOGNIZED AS:
    A.  NATURAL AND ADOPTED CHILDREN IN ORDER OF SENIORITY.  ORDER
OF SENIORITY REFERS TO AGE (OLDEST TO YOUNGEST).  THE AGE OF
MAJORITY IS 18 YEARS.  MINOR CHILDREN ARE NOT ENTITLED TO MAKE
DISPOSITION OF REMAINS.
    B.  PARENTS IN ORDER OF SENIORITY, UNLESS LEGAL EXCLUSIVE (SOLE)
CUSTODY WAS GRANTED TO A PERSON BY REASON OF A COURT DECREE OR
STATUTORY PROVISION.
    C.  THE REMARRIED SURVIVING SPOUSE.  THE TERM REMARRIED
SURVIVING SPOUSE DOES NOT INCLUDE ONE WHO OBTAINED A DIVORCE FROM
THE DECEDENT (AT ANY TIME) OR WHO REMARRIED BEFORE A FINDING OF
DEATH PURSUANT TO TITLE 37 U.S.C.
    D.  BLOOD OR ADOPTIVE RELATIVE WHO WAS GRANTED LEGAL CUSTODY OF
THE PERSON BY A COURT DECREE OR STATUTORY PROVISION.

    F.  GRANDPARENTS IN ORDER OF SENIORITY.
    G.  OTHER RELATIVES OF LEGAL AGE IN ORDER OF RELATIONSHIP TO THE
INDIVIDUAL ACCORDING TO CIVIL LAWS.  SENIORITY IN AGE CONTROLS WHEN
PERSONS ARE OF EQUAL DEGREE OF RELATIONSHIP.
    H.  PERSONS STANDING IN LOCO PARENTIS TO THE DECEDENT.
SENIORITY IN AGE WILL CONTROL WHEN THE PERSONS ARE OF EQUAL DEGREE
OF RELATIONSHIP.  FOR DISPOSING OF REMAINS, THE SECRETARY OF THE
MILITARY DEPARTMENT CONCERNED MAY BE DEEMED TO HAVE SUCH STANDING IF
NO OTHER SUCH PERSON IS AVAILABLE.
4.  INFORMATION PROVIDED FOR USE BY PSD/PSA.
    A.  DD FORM 93, RECORD OF EMERGENCY DATA IS CREATED AT THE
MILITARY ENTRANCE PROCESSING STATION WHEN A PERSON IS ENLISTED OR
INDUCTED INTO THE NAVY.  IT ALSO SERVES THE SAME PURPOSE AS NAVPERS
1070/602, PART II.
        (1) FOR MEMBERS WITH DEPENDENTS, THE DD FORM 93 WILL BE
REPLACED BY THE NAVPERS 1070/602 UPON ARRIVAL AT RECRUIT TRAINING;
OR, FOR THOSE MEMBERS NOT REQUIRED TO ATTEND RECRUIT TRAINING, UPON
ARRIVAL AT THEIR FIRST SHIP OR STATION FOR INDOCTRINATION, TRAINING,
OR DUTY.
        (2) FOR MEMBERS WITHOUT DEPENDENTS, THE DD FORM 93 MAY
REMAIN IN THE SERVICE RECORD IN LIEU OF THE NAVPERS 1070/602 UNTIL
MEMBERS REPORT TO FIRST PERMANENT DUTY STATION, UNLESS A CHANGE IS
REQUIRED TO UPDATE EMERGENCY DATA.  MEMBERS WHO MAINTAIN THE DD FORM
93 IN THEIR RECORDS SHALL ANNOTATE IN THE REMARKS PORTION OF THE
FORM, BLOCK 13, THE NAME, RELATIONSHIP, ADDRESS WITH ZIP CODE, AND
PHONE NUMBER OF THE PADD.  IF THE ADDRESS FOR THIS PERSON HAS BEEN
SHOWN IN A PRECEEDING BLOCK, IT IS UNNECESSARY TO REPEAT THE ADDRESS.
EXAMPLE:  PADD:  JOE SAILOR, FATHER, PHONE (XXX) XXX-XXXX, ADDRESS
IN BLOCK 6.
    B.  NAVPERS 1070/602, DEPENDENCY APPLICATION/RECORD OF EMERGENCY

5.  SAILORS WHO HAVE WILLS THAT CONFLICT WITH THE PROCEDURES
LISTED ABOVE OR WHO WISH FURTHER CLARIFICATION, SHOULD BE DIRECTED
TO THE NEAREST NAVY LEGAL SERVICE OFFICE FOR GUIDANCE.
6.  COMMANDS SHOULD ALSO REVIEW SERVICEMEMBERS' GROUP LIFE INSURANCE
(SGLI) ELECTION FORMS DURING THIS PROCESS.  OF PARTICULAR CONCERN
ARE THOSE SAILORS WHO ELECT TO NAME MINOR CHILDREN AS BENEFICIARIES.
WHILE THIS TYPE OF ELECTION IS AUTHORIZED AND CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD,
THE SAILOR MUST BE ADVISED THAT LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP ISSUES TO COMPLY
WITH STATE LAWS MAY PREVENT PROMPT PAYMENT OF BENEFITS.  MEMBERS
DESIRING TO PROVIDE INSURANCE PROCEEDS TO MINOR CHILDREN (LESS THAN
18 YEARS OF AGE) ARE ADVISED TO SOLICIT ADVICE AND GUIDANCE FROM
THE NEAREST NAVY LEGAL SERVICE OFFICE.
