RMKS/1.  As part of the ongoing transformation efforts of the Navy for a 
modernized pay and personnel system under Sailor 2025, this NAVADMIN 
announces the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Aviation Department Head Retention Bonus 
(ADHRB), and Aviation Command Retention Bonus (ACRB) updates for the Active 
Component (AC).

2.  AC ADHRB
    a.  The AC ADHRB eligibility criterion includes selection for Lieutenant 
Commander (LCDR).  The FY-20 ADHRB is intended for officers selected for 
promotion to LCDR in the FY-20 LCDR statutory board.  These officers will be 
considered for department head in the
FY-21 Aviation Department Head Screen Board (ADHSB) scheduled to convene in 
April 2020.  Additionally, eligible officers must have an active-duty service 
obligation (ADSO) associated with undergraduate flight training ending in FY-
19 or later.  The application opportunity commences with the release of this 
NAVADMIN and closes on 31 August 2020.
    b.  Contracts are offered with either a 3 or 5 year obligation that 
begins upon the expiration of the officers winging ADSO or contract approval, 
whichever is later.  The intent is to provide flexibility when making career 
decisions and to encourage officers to fulfill a department head tour and 
continue naval service.
    c.  The Navy values an early commitment and a 5 year obligation.
An officer who submits a 5 year contract prior to the ADHSB results being 
published will receive the maximum annual rate specific to their 
type/model/series and designator (T/M/S+D).  If an officer prefers a 3 year 
contract or wishes to wait until the ADHSB selection/slate results are 
public, the ADHRB annual amount reduces by $5,000 per year.
    d.  While all aviators who complete milestone assignments are equally 
valued, specific T/M/S+D rates vary according to respective community 
inventory health.  Those communities experiencing the greatest retention 
challenges are incentivized with the highest rates.  AC ADHRB retention bonus 
pay rates for FY-20 include:
5 year obligation, early rate:
HM Pilot                        $35,000/year ($175,000 total)

3.  AC ACRB
    a.  ACRB applicants must have screened on the FY-20 Aviation Command 
Screen Board (ACSB) as commanding officer (CO) of an eligible operational, 
operational training or special mission commander command in order to apply.  
Eligible commands are those for which the annual ACSB selects officers to 
serve as CO, excluding second-in-grade, sequential, bonus or fleet 
replacement squadron commands.  Consult the FY-20 ACRB program information 
for specific eligibility criteria and limitations.  The application 
opportunity commences with the release of this NAVADMIN and closes on 31 
August 2020.
    b.  All FY-20 ACRB contracts will be worth $100,000.  All eligible 
officers will receive an initial payment of $34,000 and two-anniversary 
payments of $33,000.  Participation in the FY-20 ACRB obligates contractees 
to 3 years of obligated service to include full completion of a post command 
commander (PCC) tour, which may be between 24 and 36 months depending on 
assignment.  ACRB obligation ends after 22 years of commissioned service, the 
projected rotation date of the assigned PCC tour or 3 years from contract 
acceptance date, whichever is later.  ACRB applications for those currently 
under ADHRB obligations will be accepted, held in abeyance and activated upon 
ADHRB contract expiration.

4.  Additional Aviation Bonus (AvB) Information

in the Career Intermission Program (CIP).  Officers interested in both AvB
