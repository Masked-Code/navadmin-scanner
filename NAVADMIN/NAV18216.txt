SUBJ/2018 VICE ADMIRAL JAMES BOND STOCKDALE LEADERSHIP AWARD WINNERS//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the 2018 recipients of the Vice Admiral 
James Bond Stockdale Leadership Award.  Commander Michael T. Lisa, former 
Commanding Officer of Electronic Attack Squadron ONE THREE FIVE (Pacific 
Fleet) and Commander Allen M. Siegrist, Commanding Officer of USS JAMES E. 
WILLIAMS (DDG 95) (U.S. Fleet Forces) were selected for their inspirational 
leadership.

2.  This fleet award was established in honor of VADM James Bond Stockdale, 
whose distinguished naval career symbolized the highest standards of 
excellence in both personal example and leadership.
The award is presented annually to two commissioned officers on active duty 
in the grade of commander or below who are serving in command of a single 
ship, submarine, aviation squadron, Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) team, naval special 
warfare squadron, SEAL delivery vehicle team, special boat team, explosive 
ordnance disposal mobile unit, mobile diving and salvage unit, or Navy 
special clearance team during the nomination cycle.  Candidates are nominated 
by peers who themselves must be eligible for the award.

3.  The 2018 winners were chosen from among seven outstanding finalists in a 
review process that included screening at the fleet commander level and final 
selection by a board of senior officers.

4.  The following finalists deserve well-earned congratulations:
    a.  Pacific Fleet finalists:
        - CDR Edward Angelinas, former Commanding Officer, USS
        MCCAMPBELL (DDG 85) and USS JOHN S. MCCAIN (DDG 56)
        - CDR Thomas ODonnell, Commanding Officer, USS OKLAHOMA
        CITY (SSN 723)
        - CDR Gerald Tritz, former Commanding Officer,
        Strike Fighter Squadron ONE NINE TWO (VFA-192)
    b.  U.S. Fleet Forces finalists:
        - CDR Jason Grizzle, Commanding Officer, USS PROVIDENCE
        (SSN 719)
        - CDR Edward Kribs, former Commanding Officer,
        Patrol Squadron EIGHT (VP-8)

5.  CDR Michael T. Lisa and CDR Allen M. Siegrist, as well as all nominees, 
should be justifiably proud of their achievements.

6.  Awards will be presented at a ceremony tentatively scheduled in the 
Pentagon on 14 November 2018.

7.  This NAVADMIN will be kept for record purposes, and will remain in effect 
until canceled or superseded.
