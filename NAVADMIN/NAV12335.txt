(PERSTEMPO) EVENTS.  REF B IS NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FY12 
AMENDING TITLE 37 U.S.C. 436.  REF C IS NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR

(DEPSECDEF) MEMO OF 8 OCTOBER 2001.   REF E IS NAVADMIN 068/01, INDIVIDUAL 
TEMPO (ITEMPO) PROGRAM.//

RMKS/1.   THIS NAVADMIN ADDRESSES A RECENT ANALYSIS OF THE NAVY'S ITEMPO 
SYSTEM DATA BASE WHICH REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY IN OUR NAVY-WIDE 
COMPLIANCE RATE FOR ITEMPO REPORTING.  AS DEPLOYMENT LENGTHS AND SCHEDULES 
CHANGE BASED ON WORLD EVENTS THE IMPACT TO SAILORS AND FAMILIES IS OF 
PARAMOUNT INTEREST.  THE NAVY'S ITEMPO DATA MUST BE ACCURATE; THEREFORE, 
REPORTING COMPLIANCE RATES MUST 
DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE. 

2.  PER REF A, THE TERM PERSONNEL TEMPO (NAVY ITEMPO EQUIVALENT) MEANS THE 
AMOUNT OF TIME MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES ARE ENGAGED IN THEIR OFFICIAL 
DUTIES AT A LOCATION OR UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAKE IT INFEASIBLE FOR A 
MEMBER TO SPEND OFF-DUTY TIME IN THE HOUSING IN WHICH THE MEMBER RESIDES.  
ITEMPO EVENTS CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO BROAD CATEGORIES; ITEMPO DEPLOYMENT 
EVENTS AND ITEMPO NON-DEPLOYMENT EVENTS.  REF B WAIVED THE REQUIREMENT TO 
TRACK NON-DEPLOYMENT ITEMPO. 

3.  RECAP OF CURRENT ITEMPO/PERSTEMPO POLICY.  
    A.  REF A MANDATED PERSTEMPO REPORTING BY SUBMISSION OF A PERSTEMPO 
TRANSACTION FILE.  RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUBMISSION OF ITEMPO TRANSACTIONS TO THE 
ITEMPO DATA SYSTEM SHALL RESIDE AT THE INDIVIDUAL UNIT LEVEL.
    B.  REF B CONVERTS HIGH-DEPLOYMENT ALLOWANCE FROM A MANDATORY ALLOWANCE TO 
AN ALLOWANCE PAYABLE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE SECRETARY OF THE MILITARY 
DEPARTMENT TO A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES FOR EACH MONTH DURING WHICH THE 
MEMBER IS DEPLOYED AND MEETS STATUTORY HIGH DEPLOYMENT GATES. 
    C.  REF C ESTABLISHES SECDEF REQUIREMENTS FOR PRESCRIBING DWELL TIME 
POLICY AND ESTABLISHING A SYSTEM FOR TRACKING, RECORDING AND MAINTAINING A 
CENTRAL REPOSITORY FOR, PERSTEMPO AND OPTEMPO 
    D.  REF D SUSPENDED, UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, APPLICABILITY OF TITLE 10 
U.S.C. 991 IN DETERMINING PAYMENTS UNDER TITLE 37 U.S.C. 436, BUT REITERATED 
THE REQUIREMENT TO CONTINUE PERSTEMPO TRACKING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN 
REF A.
    E.  THE ITEMPO USERS GUIDE CONTAINS THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION ON THE 
ITEMPO SYSTEM AND CAN BE RETRIEVED AT 
HTTP://WWW.PUBLIC.NAVY.MIL/BUPERS-NPC/SUPPORT/ITEMPO/PAGES/DEFAULT.ASPX.

4.  ITEMPO EVENTS CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO BROAD CATEGORIES; ITEMPO DEPLOYMENT 
EVENTS AND ITEMPO NON-DEPLOYMENT EVENTS.  REF E WAIVED THE REQUIREMENT TO 
TRACK NON-DEPLOYMENT ITEMPO. 
    A.  ITEMPO DEPLOYMENT EVENTS.  PER REF A, THERE ARE FIVE CATEGORIES OF 
EVENTS THAT REQUIRE TRACKING AND REPORTING, BY ALL NAVY ACTIVITIES, FOR EACH 
SAILOR.  ANY DAY AWAY FROM THE HOME THAT IS NOT EXCLUDED BY PARA 4C, MUST BE 
ACCOUNTED FOR IN ONE OF THESE FIVE CATEGORIES: 
        (1) OPERATIONS.  A MILITARY ACTION OR THE CARRYING OUT OF A STRATEGIC, 
TACTICAL, SERVICE, TRAINING OR ADMINISTRATIVEMILITARY MISSION.
        (2) EXERCISE.  A NAMED MILITARY MANEUVER OR SIMULATED WARTIME 
OPERATION INVOLVING PLANNING, PREPARATION AND EXECUTION.
        (3) UNIT TRAINING.  ALL OR PART OF A UNIT ACCOMPLISHING TRAINING 
OBJECTIVE AT A LOCATION OTHER THAN THE PERMANENT DUTY LOCATION.
        (4) HOME STATION TRAINING.  TRAINING/SERVICE PERFORMED ON BOARD THE 
PERMANENT DUTY STATION, OR WITHIN THE LOCAL AREA OF THE PERMANENT DUTY 
STATION/HOMEPORT, WHICH REQUIRES THE OVERNIGHT PRESENCE OF THE MEMBER.
        (5) MISSION SUPPORT TEMPORARY DUTY.  DUTIES THAT INCLUDE MEETINGS, 
CONFERENCES, STAFF VISITS, STAFF AUGMENTATION AND MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS.
    B.  ITEMPO DEPLOYMENT EVENT FOR A RESERVIST.  A RESERVIST IS CONSIDERED TO 
BE DEPLOYED WHEN PERFORMING ACTIVE SERVICE ON ANY DAY ON WHICH, PURSUANT TO 
ORDERS THAT DO NOT ESTABLISH A PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION (PCS), THE MEMBER 
IS PERFORMING THE ACTIVE SERVICE AT A LOCATION THAT:
        (1) IS NOT AT THE MEMBER'S PERMANENT TRAINING SITE (PTS); AND
        (2) IS AT LEAST 100 MILES ROUND TRIP OR THREE HOURS ROUND TRIP TRAVEL 
(VIA AUTOMOBILE) FROM THE MEMBER'S PERMANENT CIVILIAN RESIDENCE.
    C.  ITEMPO NON-DEPLOYMENT EVENTS (REPORTING REQUIREMENT IS WAIVED).  
        (1) DAYS IN WHICH A MEMBER IS TAD/TDY OUTSIDE THE LOCAL AREA OF THE 
PDS OR HOMEPORT TO AN "A" SCHOOL; 
        (2) DAYS IN WHICH THE MEMBER IS PERFORMING ADMINISTRATIVE, GUARD OR 
DETAIL DUTIES IN GARRISON AT THE PERMANENT DUTY STATION OR HOMEPORT.
        (3) DAYS IN WHICH A MEMBER IS HOSPITALIZED WITHIN THE LOCAL AREA OF 
THE PDS OR HOMEPORT; 
        (4) AND DAYS IN WHICH A MEMBER IS TAD/TDY TO A BRIG AS A PRISONER (OR 
IS OTHERWISE DEPLOYED SOLELY BECAUSE OF DISCIPLINARYREASONS).

5.  EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, ITEMPO REPORTING COMPLIANCE SCORECARDS WILL BE SENT 
TO EACH BUDGET SUBMITTING OFFICE.  NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (NPC) WILL MONITOR 
AND REPORT COMPLIANCE MONTHLY.  AN ITEMPO WORKING GROUP HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED 
TO CONDUCT A BOTTOM UP REVIEW OF THE NAVY ITEMPO POLICIES AND ITEMPO REPORTING 
SYSTEM PROGRAM AND PROCEDURES WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF RECOMMENDING FUTURE 
IMPLEMENTATION AND ACTIONS. 

6.  ADDITIONALLY, NPC RECENTLY REESTABLISHED A FORMAL ITEMPO PROGRAM 
MANAGEMENT OFFICE AT NPC PERS-3 TO ADMINISTER THE ITEMPO REPORTING SYSTEM 
PROGRAM, PROVIDE TRAINING, ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE TO THE FLEET REGARDING ITEMPO 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES, LIAISE WITH OPNAV N13 ON ITEMPO POLICY, PROVIDE ITEMPO 
SYSTEM ACCESS CONTROL/HELP DESK, MONITOR INDIVIDUAL TEMPO FIELD OPERATIONS,
