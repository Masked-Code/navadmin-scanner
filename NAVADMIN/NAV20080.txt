RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes references (a) through (c) and 
consolidates those NAVADMINs into one NAVADMIN for ease of 
reference.  It also adds implementing guidance in paragraph 3.H. for 
an Authorized Departure (AD) of DoD eligible family members (EFMs) 
and civilian employees in line with references (d) and (v).  This 
NAVADMIN contains measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 
throughout the Navy enterprise and amplifies DoD and DoN direction 
for Service Members and Navy civilians.  It summarizes and repeats 
applicable guidance where appropriate so that this will serve as a 
one-stop information source.  Authorized travelers will adhere to 
the Force Health Protection Guidelines (FHPG) as detailed throughout 
references (a) through (v) as summarized in this NAVADMIN, and later 
guidance. 
    1.A.  Background.  The DoD has transitioned to Phase Three 
(Respond) of reference (e), the global campaign in response to the 
COVID-19 outbreak.  Our workforce is our first line of defense.  All 
hands must proactively take action to ensure the health of our 
force, and to ensure we mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in order to 
maintain our readiness.  During the COVID-19 outbreak, the DoD and 
DoN will continue to protect and preserve the operational 
effectiveness of forces worldwide in accordance with (IAW) 
references (e) and (f).  Utilizing FHPG from the Under Secretary of 
Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&R)) provided in 
references (g) and (q), USNORTHCOM is executing its pandemic plan 
and geographic combatant commanders are executing their supporting 
pandemic plans IAW reference (h).  In compliance with updated USD 
(P&R) FHPG issued in references (i) and (j), Office of Chief Naval 
Operations (OPNAV) published initial reporting guidance supporting 
DoD response to the COVID-19 outbreak in reference (k) and updated 
that guidance in references (c), (l), and (m). 
    1.B.  Role of the CDC.  As the leading U.S. government Public 
Health Agency, the CDC continues to assess the risk of COVID-19 and 
to provide guidance for those residing in the U.S. and traveling 
abroad.  Because CDC guidance is principally tailored for persons 
residing in the U.S., some CDC COVID-19 guidance may have limited 
applicability for commanders, particularly those outside the United 
States, and is not recognized by other sovereign nations.  While DoD 
continues to follow the lead of the CDC, when needed, additional 
military specific measures are authorized to mitigate risk to U.S. 
forces stationed or deployed around the world, and to protect 
Service Members, Navy civilian employees, and their family members. 
USD (P&R) FHPG issued in reference (q) provides guidance for DoD 
personnel traveling during the novel coronavirus outbreak. 
    1.C.  CDC Travel Health Advisories.  The CDC provides travel 
health advisories at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- 
ncov/travelers/index.html.  The Advisory Levels are noted below and 
will be referenced in this NAVADMIN (note that CDC warning levels DO 
NOT apply to the U.S.): 
Level 1  Watch, practice usual precautions (risk of 
limited community transmission) 
Level 2  Alert, practice enhanced precautions 
(sustained (ongoing) community transmission) 
Level 3  Warning, avoid nonessential travel (widespread 
sustained (ongoing) transmission) 
    1.D.  DoN Civilian Guidance.  The DoN civilian workforce  more 
than 220,000 strong  plays an integral role in supporting our 
Sailors and building, manning and maintaining our ships, aircraft, 
and submarines.  Working shoulder to shoulder with our Service 
Members, it is imperative to have alignment between Navy civilian 
and military COVID-19 policy and guidance.  DoN civilian guidance is 
contained in references (r) and (t) as well as this NAVADMIN. 
    1.E.  Military Health Protection Guidance.  The Secretary of 
Defense (SECDEF) provided explicit FHPG in references (g) and (q) 
which is more restrictive than CDC guidance.  Commanders must read 
both documents in their entirety and ensure they are following the 
actions spelled out in this guidance.  Local Commanders can be more 
restrictive based on Command location, local community transmission, 
risk to mission and risk to force.  Each and every Sailor must 
ensure they proactively manage and minimize their personal risk to 
exposure, and that of their families.  Commands are charged with 
ensuring they track and monitor each Sailor and aggressively follow 
SECDEF guidance in these references. 
 
2.  Mission.  All commands will take specific actions to mitigate 
the spread of COVID-19 worldwide and adhere to the policies and 
reporting requirements contained in this NAVADMIN. 
 
3.  Policy.  This NAVADMIN applies to all Navy Service 
Members, Navy civilians, and their families assigned to DoD 
installations world-wide.  In order to maintain force health 
protection, readiness of the force and mitigate the risk of 
transmission among personnel, SECDEF directed an OCONUS 
travel stop movement to affected countries and areas 
effective 13 Mar 2020 in reference (s).  This includes all 
forms of travel (Permanent Change of Station (PCS), 
Temporary Duty (TAD/TDY), and government-funded leave).  For 
Service Members this also includes personal leave and other 
non-official travel.  On 13 March 2020 Deputy SECDEF 
directed a domestic travel stop movement in reference (u). 
In line with references (t) and (u), which provides domestic 
travel guidance, all Service Members will stop movement and 
Navy civilian personnel and family members whose 
transportation is government funded will also stop movement. 
The domestic travel stop movement applies to PCS and 
TAD/TDY, and Service Members are only authorized local 
leave.  Until the domestic travel restrictions prescribed 
above are lifted, Navy commands may only gain/onboard 
civilian employees within the local commuting area.  The 
following domestic travel is authorized:  (1) Travel by 
patients and medical providers for the purpose of medical 
treatment for Navy personnel and their family members (2) 
Individuals who have already initiated PCS or TDY travel 
(including intermediate stops) are authorized to continue to 
their final destination (see paragraphs 3.B. through 3.E. 
for further amplification) (3)  Individuals whose TDY and/or 
leave ends while this NAVADMIN is in effect are authorized 
to return to their home station at the end of their TDY 
and/or leave (see paragraph 3.C. through 3.F. for further 
amplification) (4)Individuals pending retirement or 
separation during this period are exempt.  This stop 
movement (both overseas and domestic) will remain in effect 
until 11 May 2020. 
    3.A.  Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Overseas.  Service 
Members, Navy civilians and dependents under OCONUS PCS orders to 
locations designated CDC COVID-19 Warning Level 3 or CDC COVID-19 
Alert Level 2 will follow the guidance in section 3.A. of this 
NAVADMIN.  Note that CDC warning levels DO NOT apply to CONUS. 
          3.A.1.  PCS orders to or from CDC COVID-19 Warning Level 3 
locations for Service Members.  Service Members and their dependents 
under PCS orders to or from a CDC COVID-19 Warning Level 3 location 
will stop movement.  This policy applies to currently designated CDC 
COVID-19 Warning Level 3 locations, or those designated Level 3 at a 
later date. 
                  3.A.1.a.  Service Members who have detached from 
their parent command prior to the date of this NAVADMIN and are in 
transit are directed to contact Navy Personnel Command (NPC) for 
follow-on guidance per paragraph 5.A.  NPC is standing by to address 
each specific case and will authorize entitlements based on current 
location and situation. 
                  3.A.1.b.  Detaching and gaining commands shall 
make every effort to contact affected Service Members enroute 
to/from their command to advise them of the contents of this 
message. 
          3.A.2.  PCS orders to CDC COVID-19 Alert Level 2 locations 
for Service Members.  Service Members under PCS orders to a CDC 
COVID-19 Alert Level 2 location will execute orders.  Dependents of 
Service Members executing accompanied PCS orders to a CDC COVID-19 
Alert Level 2 location will delay travel to the CDC COVID-19 Alert 
Level 2 location until 11 May 2020.  This policy applies to 
currently designated CDC Alert Level 2 locations and those 
designated at a later date. 
                  3.A.2.a.  Service Members who have detached from 
their parent command prior to the date of this NAVADMIN and are in 
transit are directed to contact NPC for follow-on guidance per 
paragraph 5.A.  NPC is standing by to address each specific case and 
will authorize entitlements based on current location and situation. 
                  3.A.2.b.  Detaching and gaining commands shall 
make every effort to contact affected Service Members enroute 
to/from their command to advise them of the contents of this 
message. 
          3.A.3.  PCS orders to or from CDC COVID-19 Warning Level 3 
locations for Navy civilians.  Navy civilians and their dependents 
under PCS orders to or from a CDC COVID-19 Warning Level 3 location 
will stop movement.  This policy applies to currently designated CDC 
COVID-19 Warning Level 3 locations, or those designated Level 3 at a 
later date.  Contact your supervisory chain of command for further 
guidance. 
          3.A.4.  PCS orders to CDC COVID-19 Alert Level 2 locations 
for Navy civilians.  Navy civilians under PCS orders to a CDC COVID- 
19 Alert Level 2 location will execute orders.  Dependents of Navy 
civilians executing accompanied PCS orders to a CDC COVID-19 Alert 
Level 2 location will delay travel to the CDC COVID-19 Alert Level 2 
location until 11 May 2020.  This policy applies to currently 
designated CDC Alert Level 2 locations and those designated at a 
later date.  Additionally, until the travel restrictions are lifted 
Navy civilian hiring actions for positions in Level 2 and Level 3 
countries are postponed for non-essential civilian personnel who 
have not yet begun travel.  Contact your supervisory chain of 
command for further guidance. 
    3.B.  PCS in the United States and its territories.  Service 
Members, Navy civilians and dependents under domestic PCS orders 
will follow the guidance in section 3.B. of this NAVADMIN. 
          3.B.1. Navy Civilians.  All Department of the Navy 
civilian employees whose transportation is government funded will 
stop movement.  Navy commands may continue civilian hiring actions, 
but may only onboard civilian employees in the local commuting area. 
Contact your supervisory chain of command for further guidance. 
          3.B.2.  Service Members. 
                  3.B.2.a.  Service Members who have not yet 
initiated PCS travel as of the effective date of this 
NAVADMIN are directed to contact NPC for follow-on guidance 
per paragraph 5.A.  NPC is standing by to address each 
specific case and will authorize entitlements based on 
current location and situation. 
                  3.B.2.b. For Service Members who have 
already initiated PCS travel, detaching and gaining commands 
shall make every effort to contact those Service Members to 
advise them of the contents of this message. 
                  3.B.2.c. A local PCS move may be executed without 
an exception since it does not involve travel outside of the local 
area.  To be clear, same geographic location PCS moves will only be 
executed with due regard to the operational readiness of the 
commands involved.  Losing and gaining commands are encouraged to 
coordinate with placement coordinators and detailers in PERS-4 as 
required.  PERS-4 shall adjudicate same geographic location PCS move 
decisions in situations where losing and gaining commands do not 
agree on an execution timeline.  This adjudication may be delegated, 
but no lower than the O-6 Division Director level at PERS-4. 
    3.C.  Other Official Overseas Travel (Meetings, Conferences, 
Site Visits, etc).  All other official travel by Service Members and 
Navy civilians to or from a country designated as CDC COVID-19 
Warning Level 3, is prohibited and will require an exception IAW

promulgated by the Chief of Navy Reserves. 
    3.E.  Travel for Official Training (Overseas and Domestic). 
          3.E.1.  Service Member and Navy civilian travel to attend 
formal training will require an exception IAW paragraph 3.G prior to 
travel, will require advance coordination with the training command 
and will comply with Navy Component Commander guidance concerning 
pre- and post- travel medical screening and reception procedures to 
include restriction of movement (ROM) if applicable. 
          3.E.2.  Service Members and Navy civilians currently under 
PCS or TAD/TDY orders and attending training and/or schools will 
complete their current training and/or school.  For those on TAD/TDY 
orders, Service Members and Navy civilians are directed to contact 
the command that issued the orders for returning 
instructions/guidance.  Navy civilians executing PCS orders are 
directed to contact the command that issued the orders for further 
guidance.  Service Members executing PCS orders are directed to 
contact Navy Personnel Command for guidance and potential orders 
modification.  Once the current school/training is complete, Service 
Members should expect to take one of the following actions:  (1) 
Return to their previous Permanent Duty Station (PDS), (2) Remain at 
the school/training site if prudent for health protection, (3) If 
the next school/training is in the same location and the course is 
still being offered, continue training.  Reevaluate after 
school/training completion, (4) Proceed to the ultimate PDS. 
Decisions will be based on force health protection considerations. 
Throughout the process, Service Members should consult with their 
affected command (current, losing or future) as well as their 
detailer where applicable. 
   3.F.  Personal Leave and Liberty (overseas and domestic). 
Commanding Officers (CO) and officers in charge may authorize local 
leave IAW command policy for Service Members.  Leave or personal 
travel outside of the local area, as defined by Commanding Officers 
and officers in charge, requires an exception as outlined in 
paragraph 3.G.  For those Service Members currently on leave, COs or 
officers in charge are delegated authority to terminate leave early 
or allow completion of leave as authorized based on location, 
duration and risk to Service Member.  For Navy civilians, approval 
or denial of civilian annual leave requests will be based on mission 
requirements.  While intended travel outside the local commuting 
area may be considered in determining impact to mission 
requirements, leave requests for Navy civilians cannot be denied 
solely because an employee is travelling outside of the local 
commuting area.  In line with reference (t) paragraph 3(b), Navy 
civilian employees are strongly encouraged to avoid personal leave 
outside of the local area. 
  3.G.  Exceptions. 
          3.G.1.  Individuals pending retirement or separation 
within the next 60 days are exempt from this stop movement. 
          3.G.2.  Commanding officers and officers in charge may 
request an exception to paragraphs 3.A. through 3.F. in the 
following cases:  (1) determined to be mission essential, (2) 
necessary for humanitarian reasons, or (3) warranted due to extreme 
hardship.  Mission-essential travel refers to work that must be 
performed to ensure the continued operations of mission essential 
functions, as determined by the local Commander. 
                  3.G.2.a.  Navy Personnel Command (PERS-4) is 
authorized to approve or deny stop movement exceptions for Service 
Member PCS travel in paragraphs 3.A., 3.B., and 3.E.2.  Approvals of 
exception requests shall be made via message traffic to all 
concerned and will specify whether dependents are authorized to 
accompany the Service Member.  Detaching Commander endorsement is 
required.  Upon receipt of an approved exception, Transaction 
Service Center or Personnel Support Detachment/personnel offices 
will process the Service Member for transfer to the gaining command. 
Send all exception requests to pers451(at)navy.mil with the subject 
line PCS EXCEPTION REQUEST.  Exception request formats will be 
provided by PERS-4 and posted on MyNavy Portal.  Service Members who 
are granted an exception and are traveling from a CDC COVID-19 
Warning Level 3 or Alert Level 2 location will receive guidance from 
NPC concerning Navy Component Commander pre- and post- travel 
medical screening and reception procedures to include ROM. 
                  3.G.2.b.  Authority to approve or deny stop 
movement exceptions for Service Members in the case of:  (1) 
Official travel in paragraph 3.C. and 3.D., and (2) Official 
training, not associated with a PCS, in paragraph 3.E., and (3) 
Leave requests that include travel outside of the local area in 
paragraph 3.F, is delegated to the echelon 2 commander.  The echelon 
2 commander may further delegate exception authority, but no lower

chain of command of the Service Member.  Those who are granted an 
exception will comply with the echelon 2 guidance concerning pre- 
and post- travel screening and reception procedures. 
                3.G.2.c.  Exceptions for PCS of Navy civilians. 
Authority to approve or deny exceptions of the PCS of Navy civilians 
from outside the local commuting area in paragraphs 3.A. and 3.B is 
delegated to the echelon 2 commander.  The echelon 2 commander may 
further delegate exception authority, but no lower than the first 
flag officer or SES in the chain of command of the command or 
activity performing the hiring action.  Those who are granted an 
exception will comply with the echelon 2 guidance concerning pre- 
and post- travel screening and reception procedures. 
                3.G.2.d.  Authority to approve or deny stop movement 
exceptions for Navy civilians in the case of: (1) Official travel in 
paragraph 3.C. and 3.D. and (2) Official training, not associated 
with a PCS, in paragraph 3.E. is delegated to the echelon 2 
commander.  The echelon 2 commander may further delegate exception 
authority, but no lower than the first flag officer or SES in the 
Service Member or Navy civilian employee chain of command.  Those 
who are granted an exception will comply with the echelon 2 guidance 
concerning pre- and post- travel screening and reception procedures. 
    3.H.  Authorized Departure. 
          3.H.1.  The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Personnel and Readiness) has announced an Authorized Departure (AD) 
as outlined in reference (d).  In line with reference (v), Navy 
Service Member eligible family members (EFMs) and Department of the 
Navy civilian employees who have determined they are at higher risk 
of a poor health outcome if exposed to COVID-19 or who have 
requested departure based on a commensurate justification in foreign 
areas as well as a civilian employee and/or other eligible family 
members who may need to accompany them - are authorized to depart 
their current duty station.  DoN civilian employees who wish to 
depart their duty station must consult with their chain of command. 
          3.H.2.  The designated safe-haven for departing Service 
Member eligible family members is the contiguous United States (US). 
The designated safe-haven for departing DoN civilian employees is 
Arlington, Virginia.  Members should work with their commands and 
local travel office to arrange for transportation to their safe- 
haven.  Authorized departures are only permitted when appropriate 
transportation and reception procedures are in place consistent with 
reference (s).  Travelers should be aware that preventative health 
measures to include restricted movement and business closures have 
been implemented in the United States to various degrees by federal, 
state and local governments.  Travelers shall be advised to check 
the restrictions applicable to their situation, based on their 
departure location, any enroute locations (foreign and in the United 
States) and their ultimate safe-haven, as well as availability of 
lodging, prior to commencing travel.  IAW the Joint Travel 
Regulations (JTR), chapter 6, dependents must designate their 
specific safe haven location in the United States upon, or prior to, 
entry to the United States.  Once designated, the specific safe- 
haven cannot be changed.  Dependents of uniformed personnel will be 
processed for safe-haven allowances IAW with the JTR, Chapter 6, 
paragraph 0602.  DoN civilian employees and their eligible family 
members will be processed for allowances IAW with the JTR, Chapter 
6, paragraph 0604. 
          3.H.3.  It is strongly recommended that eligible family 
members and civilian employees after traveling to, through and from 
a location with a Center for Disease Control Travel Health Notice 
for COVID-19 take the following measure for the next 14 days:  (a) 
Implement self-observations for symptoms of fever, cough or 
difficulty breathing (b) Implement social distancing, e.g., remain 
out of congregate settings, avoid mass gatherings, and maintain 6 
feet distance from others when possible (c) If individuals feel 
feverish or develop measured fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, 
immediately self-isolate, limit contact with others, and seek advice 
by telephone from the appropriate healthcare provider to determine 
whether medical evaluation is required,. 
          3.H.4.  The following provides general information for 
Service Member eligible family members regarding allowances. Members 
are advised that the impact of this authorized departure on their 
specific allowances is highly dependent on member individual 
circumstances.  For questions regarding specific allowances, members 
should contact their nearest Personnel Support Detachment or My Navy 
Career Center (MNCC) or consult the JTR, chapter 6. 
                  3.H.4.a. Per diem:  Transportation expenses and 
travel per diem are authorized from the time the family departs the 
evacuation site, through the time they reach their selected safe 
haven location in the continental United States including processing 
time at both the evacuation and receiving site.  A non-command 
sponsored dependent is only authorized transportation and per diem. 
Other allowances will not be paid. 
                  3.H.4.b.  Escort allowances:  Travel and 
transportation allowances are also payable to a member, a U.S. 
government civilian employee, or a person who travels under an 
official travel authorization/order as an escort for an evacuated 
dependent who is incapable of traveling alone to the safe haven due 
to age, physical or mental incapacity, or other extraordinary 
circumstances. 
                  3.H.4.c.  Household goods (HHG)/shipping 
allowance: upon a dependent departing for a safe haven, 
unaccompanied baggage (for the dependent), and HHG items as needed 
for dependent comfort and well-being, may be transported at 
government expense.

          3.L.1.  IAW reference (q), Commanders should identify and 
track all Service Members who travel or have a history of travel in 
the prior 14 days.  This includes travel by military or commercial 
means as well as private conveyance and includes all forms of travel 
to include PCS, temporary duty and leave.  Commanders shall ensure 
Service Members implement the following actions for the next 14 
days: 
                  3.L.1.a.  Implement self-observation, i.e., take 
temperature twice a day and remain alert for fever (>100.4 degrees F 
or 38 degrees C) and remain alert for fever, cough or difficulty 
breathing. 
                  3.L.1.b.  To the extent possible implement social 
distancing, i.e., remain out of congregate settings, avoid mass 
gatherings and maintain 6 feet or 2 meter distance from others when 
possible. 
                  3.L.1.c.  If individuals feel feverish or develop 
measured fever, cough or difficulty breathing, immediately self- 
isolate, limit contact with others and seek advice by telephone from 
the appropriate healthcare provider to determine whether medical 
evaluation is required. 
          3.L.2.  Commanders will adhere to DoD guidance for 
personnel traveling during the novel coronavirus outbreak per 
reference (q) to include COVID-19 screening at overseas military 
transportation terminals per reference (n).  Commanders will review 
the supplemental risk-based measures and observe the operational 
risk level mitigation actions for COVID-19 outlined in reference 
(f). 
          3.L.3.  For individuals traveling OCONUS to OCONUS, 
Commanders will ensure travel is mission essential and follow the 
guidance listing in reference (s) if compelling exceptions are 
necessary.  Military air crew are exempt from the requirements in 
this NAVADMIN, but will ensure they actively practice social 
distancing and prudent measures to mitigate potential contact and 
COVID-19 transmission. 
          3.L.4.  Commanders will comply with status of forces 
agreements when applicable. 
          3.L.5.  Consider measures to place mission essential shore 
staffs on alternating day or split shift rotations. 
          3.L.6.  Use maximum latitude to authorize telework, 
liberal leave, permissive TDY as necessary to minimize spread within 
your teams. 
          3.L.7.  Implement social distancing techniques for any 
meetings you conduct. 
          3.L.8.  Ensure the health of your force by conducting 
regular screenings and restrict movement of those potentially

    3.M. Entitlements.  Changes to entitlements associated with a 
ROM have been approved and put in place by DoD.  The entitlements 
include, but are not limited to per diem for Service Members and 
dependents directed to ROM after arrival at a duty station after a 
PCS move and the implementation of Hardship Duty Pay (HDP)  ROM for 
members who incur unreimbursed lodging expenses when directed to ROM 
at their PDS.  Additionally, the Pay and Personnel Management Branch 
(PERS-2) has released Pay and Personnel Information Bulletin (PPIB) 
20-5 and 20-6 which provided Navy Pay Offices with information 
regarding recent JTR changes regarding self-isolation and 
establishment of HDP-ROM.  Eligibility for entitlements varies based 
on individual circumstances.  If you have questions about 
entitlements, please contact the MyNavy career center (1-833-330- 
6622) or via e-mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil. 
 
4.  Regular Reporting.  For CONUS commands, ensure your points of 
contact (POC) submit accurate and timely COVID-19 daily reports and 
CCIRs to USFFC, with an information copy to the local installation 
commander, for consolidation and subsequent reporting to OPNAV.  For 
OCONUS commands, ensure your POCs submit accurate and timely COVID- 
19 daily reports and CCIRs to the Navy Component Command/echelon 2 
command, with an information copy to the local installation 
commander, for consolidation and subsequent reporting to OPNAV. 
Given potential rapid escalation of case numbers and impact on 
readiness, additional reporting is required.  Navy commands will 
report the following through their chain of command and via OPREP 
where appropriate: 
    4.A.  COVID-19 daily reports.  COVID-19 Case Information broken 
out by Active-Duty, DON Civilian, Military Family Members and Navy

5.  Points of Contact. 
    5.A.  Sailor Support.  Service Members with questions regarding 
this stop movement or entitlements for PCS travel should contact the 
MyNavy Career Center (1-833-330-6622) or email ASKMNCC(AT)NAVY.MIL. 
Detailers are ready to support all order modifications and commands 
should work with their placement officers. 
    5.B.  Medical Questions.  BUMED Watch:  703-681-1087/1125 or 
NIPR EMAIL:  usn.ncr.bumedfchva.list.bumed---2019-ncov-response- 
cell(AT)mail.mil. 
    5.C.  Reporting Requirements.  OPNAV Battle Watch Captain at 
703-692-9284 or BWC.PTGN(AT)NAVY.MIL. 
    5.D.  Navy civilians.  Navy civilians with questions regarding 
this guidance should contact their supervisory chain of command. 
 
6.  The Navy will ensure the best possible Navy-wide Force Health 
Protection for its Sailors, civilian employees and family members. 
However, all members of the Navy family must do their part by 
adhering to CDC guidelines as they relate to basic hygiene and human 
interaction.  The Navy will remain focused on meeting our global 
commitments while also ensuring the health and well-being of our 
Service Members, Navy civilians and our families. 
 
7.  Our understanding of COVID-19 is rapidly evolving and 
this guidance will continue to be evaluated as conditions 
change.  We recognize many of the policies in this NAVADMIN 
will place a strain on our force, but they are absolutely 
necessary to preserve our ability to conduct the mission. 
Local Commanders will exercise prudent judgement when 
determining mission essential travel and granting waivers 
and err on the side of conservatism.  This is not business 
as usual.  The expectation is that these exceptions are 
done on a case by case basis and that they are very limited 
in number.  The entire team must understand their role in 
minimizing the spread of COVID-19 among our ranks.  All 
efforts should be taken to combat the spread of COVID-19 
and to minimize impact on our force.  The Navy will remain 
focused on meeting our global commitments while also 
ensuring the health and well-being of our Service Members, 
Navy civilians and our families. 
 
8.  As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, Commander 
feedback is an important part of issuing revised or additional 
guidance.  It is virtually impossible to address all specific cases 
or situations.  However, Commanders have the latitude to adjust 
direction based upon their unique situation.  For example, a unit 
that has been at sea for 14 days with no COVID-19 cases may make the 
decision to relax social distancing requirements until they pull 
into port.  Thank you for your leadership at the tip of the spear, 
wherever that may be.  We know that it is not easy and simply ask 
that you make the best call possible  we will back you up.
