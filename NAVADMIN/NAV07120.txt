SUBJ/MILITARY SPOUSE APPRECIATION DAY// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS FRIDAY, 11 MAY, IS MILITARY SPOUSE 
APPRECIATION DAY.  I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN ME IN THANKING THE WONDERFUL 
HUSBANDS AND WIVES OF OUR NAVY'S SAILORS AND CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES FOR ALL 
THEY DO TO MAKE OUR SERVICE POSSIBLE.
2.  NO ONE CAN SUCCEED IN THIS BUSINESS ALONE.  NO ONE.  IT IS TOO 
TOUGH, TOO DEMANDING -- ESPECIALLY TODAY AS WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT A LONG 
AND TREACHEROUS WAR AGAINST AGILE FORCES OF TERROR AROUND THE GLOBE.  
WE ALL NEED HELP FROM TIME TO TIME.  WE ALL NEED SOMEONE TO TURN TO FOR 
LOVE, SUPPORT, AND EVEN A LITTLE GUIDANCE.  WE ALL NEED A SHOULDER AT 
HOME.  FOR MANY OF US THAT SHOULDER BELONGS TO A SPOUSE.  I KNOW THAT 
HAS CERTAINLY BEEN THE CASE IN MY HOME AND IN MY FAMILY FOR MORE THAN 
36 YEARS.
3.  OUR SPOUSES SERVE AS WE SERVE, EVERY BIT AS MUCH.  THEY DO NOT BEAR 
THE ARMS, BUT THEIR OPEN ARMS PROVIDE STRENGTH AND COMFORT.
THEY DO NOT SET THE SHIP'S COURSE, BUT THEIR INTERNAL COMPASS KEEPS THE 
FAMILY READY AND ON TRACK.  THEY DO NOT FORD THE STREAM OR BUILD THE 
BRIDGE, BUT THE BRIDGE THEY PROVIDE BACK TO THE HOME SUSTAINS AND 
IMPROVES THE MORALE AND PERFORMANCE OF ENTIRE UNITS.
4.  THE TRUTH IS THAT MILITARY SPOUSES PLAY A SPECIAL, VITAL ROLE IN 
NATIONAL SECURITY, PERHAPS EVEN MORE THAN THEY REALIZE.  COMBAT 
READINESS IS TIED TO FAMILY READINESS, AND OUR SPOUSES ARE VITAL TO 
BOTH.  I AM NOT SURE WE CAN EVER SAY ENOUGH OR DO ENOUGH TO TRULY THANK 
THEM FOR THAT EFFORT, BUT WE SHOULD TRY.  IF YOU ARE A MARRIED SAILOR 
OR NAVY CIVILIAN, I URGE YOU TO TAKE TIME OUT THIS FRIDAY TO RECOGNIZE 
THE ONE WHO SERVES ALONGSIDE YOU.  I ALSO ENCOURAGE COMMANDS TO THANK 
THE HUSBAND AND WIFE PARTNERSHIPS UPON WHOSE BROAD, BRAVE SHOULDERS OUR 
GREAT NAVY RESTS.
