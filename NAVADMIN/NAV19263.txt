RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and provides amplifying 
guidelines for the execution of reference (b) during Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20). 
This NAVADMIN does not supersede, supplant, or re-state existing policy 
called out in references (b) through (j).  As local policy may be more 
restrictive, all subordinate commands should refer to their Echelon II 
Command Information Officer (CIO) for additional guidance in regards to this 
NAVADMIN.  Note:  Deputy DON Chief Information Officer (Navy) (DDCIO(N)) will 
conduct a thorough assessment of all ITPR thresholds and Echelon I Subject 
Matter Expert (SME) review criteria established herein to find efficiencies 
and reduce administrative burden.  Navy Information Technology Procurement 
Request
(ITPR) policy and process documentation will be updated, as necessary.

2.  The ITPR process ensures efficient expenditure of Information Technology
(IT) funding; prevents duplicative investments; provides visibility into all 
Navy IT-related expenditures; achieves strategic sourcing for IT capabilities 
and procurements; and enforces compliance with Federal, Department of Defense 
(DoD), Department of the Navy (DON), and Navy laws, regulations, policies, 
and guidance (LRPGs).  All ITPRs will be submitted electronically via the 
Navy Information Technology Approval System (NAV-ITAS) in accordance with 
reference (b).

3.  The following FY20 guidelines will be used for the submission of ITPRs in
FY20:
    a.  SME Speed Pass:  The SME Speed Pass was devised to make it easier for
    commands to expedite ITPR reviews.  The SME Speed Pass may only be used 
    for the following IT procurements to allow for expedited review and only when
    authorized by the applicable Echelon II CIO or similar authority.
        (1) All active programs of record (POR).  POR information must be
        supplied within the ITPR if this option is selected.
            (a) Active Business Category (BCAT) programs that have been
            certified for the year of execution (YOE) in accordance with 10 
            U.S.C. 2222.
            Active BCAT programs that were not certified (e.g., below the 
            certification threshold) are not eligible for SME Speed Pass; and
            (b) Active Acquisition Category (ACAT) programs currently 
            registered in the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, (ASN) Research, 
            Development and Acquisition (RDA) Information System (RDAIS) 
            (https://rdais.navy.mil).  Only Those programs that appear in the list of Navy Programs in RDAIS 
            are considered active ACAT programs and are eligible for SME Speed Pass.  ACAT 
            programs that are currently in an inactive status in RDAIS or greater than 90 
            percent fielded are not eligible for SME Speed Pass.
        (2) Covered purchases under the FY17 National Defense Authorization Act
        (NDAA) Section 233 Pilot Program (reference (c)) and the ASN(RDA) 
        approved process.  Additional direction regarding the Section 233 ITPR process 
        will be promulgated separately by ASN(RDA) and DDCIO(N).
        (3) Procurements that are out of scope of the ITPR policy per 
        reference (b); and
        (4) Procurements that are exempt from the ITPR requirements in FY20, 
        as noted in paragraph 5 of this document.
    b.  Multi-Function Device (MFD) and print device products and/or 
    services:
    The following guidelines are applicable for the procurement of any MFD 
    product and/or service in FY20:

        to all-in-one MFDs, single-use printers, additive manufacturing products 
        (e.g., 3-D printers), copiers, scanners, fax machines, and all other print 
        device products and/or services not documented herein but determined by 
        DDCIO(N) to be in scope of reference (d).
        (2) Per reference (d), all procurement actions for MFD and print 
        device products and/or services made outside of the Defense Logistics Agency 
        (DLA) or The Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) marketplace must submit 
        a waiver for approval by the appropriate Echelon I SME.
        (3) All ITPRs for the procurement of MFD and print device products 
        and/or services from DLA must be submitted by 22 June 2020 in order to 
        meet the DLA procurement cut-off date of 1 July 2020.  Requests submitted after 22 
        June 2020 will not be considered without documented extenuating circumstances.
    c.  Windows 10 Secure Host Baseline (WIN 10 SHB) Migration:  Per 
    reference (e), all DoD component organizations must migrate from Microsoft legacy
    operating systems to the Defense Information Service Agency approved WIN 10 SHB

    accepted starting 1 June 2020.
        (1) ITPRs requesting approval for execution of FY21 funding submitted

        in support of a Defense Business System (DBS) are subject to FY21 DBS 
        certification by the appropriate approval authority.  Approving this request will not 
        cause an Anti-Deficiency Act violation and/or an unauthorized commitment on behalf 
        of the government.

            statement must be included in the ITPR executive summary:  The

5.  Unless otherwise directed by the Echelon II command, the following are 
exempt from the ITPR requirements in FY20 and, therefore, do not require 
submission or approval of an ITPR:

    communications weapon systems.  This is not a blanket exemption for all
    Warfighting Mission Area systems, lab infrastructure, or other types of
    National Security Systems.  This exemption does not apply to embedded 
    software and/or systems that will be purchased using a DON, DoD, or Joint ELA or
    ESI.  This exemption does include IT embedded in replicas of weapons 
    systems for Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation lab use.
        (1) Embedded software is computer software, written to control 
        machines or devices that are not typically thought of as computers.
        (2) An embedded system is a programmed controlling and operating 
        system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical 
        system, Often with real-time computing constraints.  It is embedded as part 
        of a complete device, often including hardware and mechanical parts.

    to MFDs or print device products and/or services as defined in paragraph 3.b.(1).
        (1) Per reference (j), a consumable item is an item of supply or an
        individual item (except explosive ordnance and major end items of 
        equipment) that is normally expended or used up beyond recovery in the use for

        (2) A peripheral device is an internal or external device that 
        connects to and works with a computer to expand the functionality of the 
        computer.  A peripheral device is optional (i.e., not required for the computer to 
        operate), and can only function when connected to a computer.   Peripheral 
        devices connect with a computer through an input/output (I/O) interface 
        (e.g., Universal Serial Bus (USB) or serial port), or may be connected 
        wirelessly.  A peripheral device may also be referred to as an external peripheral, 
        integrated peripheral, auxiliary component, computer peripheral, or I/O device.
