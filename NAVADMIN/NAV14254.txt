RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the FY-14 flight hour verification process 
for conditional Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP) and Hazardous Duty 
Incentive Pay for Flying (HDIP-F).  Per reference (a), all recipients of 
conditional ACIP or HDIP-F are required to track flight hours per month, and 
report them to Navy Personnel Command (NPC) ACIP Program Manager (PERS-435).  
Commanding officers and other reporting seniors are responsible for verifying 
the accuracy and completeness of flight hour verification letters for 
officers under their charge, and reporting such by endorsing verification 
letters on command letterhead.  Templates for the reporting senior*s 
endorsement, as well as an example of the verification letter, can be found 
in reference (a).  A downloadable pre-formatted template for the verification 
letter is also available on the NPC ACIP website at 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/Detailing/aviation/OCM/Pages/ACIP.aspx.

2.  Conditional ACIP may be paid to those aeronautically designated officers 
in the following categories:
    a.  Aeromedical officers.
    b.  Aviation officers who would otherwise be eligible for continuous ACIP 
but have not met the months of operational flying requirements at the 12-year 
or 18-year gate.
    c.  Aviation officers, O-6 and below, with more than 25 years of aviation 
service.

3.  In order to be eligible for conditional ACIP, an officer must be under 
orders to Duty in a Flying Status Involving Operational or Training Flights 
(DIFOPS), must occupy a billet designated XXX1 or XXX2 (a DIFOPS billet), and 
must fly the minimum hours prescribed in reference (b).

4.  HDIP-F may be paid to non-aeronautically designated officers and 
aeronautically designated Flag officers required by competent orders to 
participate in regular and frequent aerial flights as crew or non-crew 
members.  HDIP-F eligibility requires a non-aeronautically designated officer 
to be under orders to duty involving flying as a technical observer.  An 
aeronautically designated Flag officer must be under DIFOPS orders to 
maintain HDIP-F eligibility.  All must fly the minimum hours prescribed in 
reference (b).  Officers entitled to ACIP are not entitled to HDIP-F.

5.  Any officer who received any conditional ACIP or HDIP-F payment during 
FY-14 is required to provide total flight hours, by month, from 1 October 
2013 through 30 September 2014 to PERS-435 no later than 31 December 2014.  
Required format for flight hour submissions and commanding officer 
endorsement letters are located in reference (a).  If a member did not 
complete the minimum flight hour requirements as established in reference 
(b), unearned ACIP/HDIP-F will be recouped.  Underpayments will also be 
corrected.  If no flight hours are submitted by 31 December 2014, the 
officer*s entitlement to ACIP or HDIP-F will stop and he or she will forfeit 
the entire FY-14 entitlement to conditional ACIP or HDIP-F.  The repayment 
process of the ACIP received will be initiated as applicable.  It is the 
responsibility of each individual recipient of conditional ACIP/HDIP-F to 
ensure that the flight hour verification letter and endorsement are completed 
in accordance with reference (a), to deliver them on time by mail/e-mail/fax 
to PERS-435, and to verify that they have been received by PERS-435 (see e-
mail contacts below).

6.  Members shall send original flight hour submissions and command 
endorsements by mail to:

    Commander, Navy Personnel Command
    PERS-435
    5720 Integrity Drive
    Millington, TN 38055-4300

Submission of backup copies via e-mail or fax is authorized to ensure receipt 
by PERS-435, but hardcopy of the original documents must be submitted to the 
address above.  E-mail submissions should be made to Mr. Paul Boundy at 
paul.boundy@navy.mil and Ms. Mindy Weeden at melinda.weeden@navy.mil.  If e-
mail is not possible, please fax submissions to (901) 874-2721/2756, 
attention PERS-435.

7.  Once flight hours are received, verification of hours flown and monthly 
entitlement(s) earned will be calculated by PERS-435.
Overpayment and underpayment cases will be forwarded to Defense Financing and 
Accounting Service for appropriate corrective action.
Negotiation of repayment plans for recoupment may be discussed directly with 
the member*s servicing personnel support detachment.
Verification of flight hours in FY-13 and earlier will not be accepted.

8.  Point of contact for ACIP and HDIP-F policy is LCDR Gregory Jonic (PERS-
435), at (901) 874-3484/DSN 882 or via e-mail at gregory.jonic(at)navy.mil.

9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
