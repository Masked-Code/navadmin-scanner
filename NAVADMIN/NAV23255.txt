SUBJ/248TH CHAPLAIN CORPS ANNIVERSARY MESSAGE// 
 
RMKS/1.  On 28 November 1775, the Continental Congress directed that 
divine services be held aboard all naval ships, and thus the Navy 
Chaplain Corps was born.  For 248 years, Navy Chaplains have cared 
for Sailors and Marines around the globe and through every conflict, 
at sea and ashore. 
 
2.  Today, the men and women of the Chaplain Corps continue to 
enhance the spiritual readiness of our people.  Readiness for the test 
of war is impossible without Sailors and Marines who are ready in 
body, mind, and spirit.  It is the work of our Chaplains and Religious 
Program Specialists that enables our people to be spiritually ready 
for the challenges ahead. Thank you for your legacy of care to our people. 
 
3.  Happy 248th birthday, Chaplains! 
 
4.  Released by Mr. Andrew S. Haeuptle, Director, Navy Staff on behalf of 
Rear Admiral Gregory Todd, Chief of Chaplains.//
