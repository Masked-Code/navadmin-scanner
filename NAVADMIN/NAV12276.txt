SUBJ/2012 OMBUDSMAN APPRECIATION DAY//

RMKS/1. 14 SEPTEMBER 2012 MARKS THE 42ND ANNIVERSARY OF THE NAVY 
FAMILY OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK 
ALL OF THE DEDICATED VOLUNTEER NAVY OMBUDSMEN WORLDWIDE, WHO WORK 
TIRELESSLY TO SUPPORT OUR SAILORS, NAVY CIVILIANS, AND FAMILIES.    

2. EVERY DAY, OUR OMBUDSMEN SERVE AS VITAL LIAISONS BETWEEN 
COMMAND LEADERSHIP AND FAMILIES. THEY ALLOW SAILORS AND NAVY 
CIVILIANS TO FOCUS ON THE MISSION AND ALWAYS BE READY. WITH THE 
MULITITUDE OF CHALLENGES THAT SAILORS AND FAMILIES FACE, THEIR ROLE 
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER MAINTAINING MISSION AND FAMILY READINESS.  

3. ALTHOUGH THEIR SERVICE IS APPRECIATED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, WE SET 
ASIDE 14 SEPTEMBER AS OMBUDSMAN APPRECIATION DAY. I ENCOURAGE ALL 
COMMANDS TO HOST APPROPRIATE FUNCTIONS THAT EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE AND 
APPRECIATION.

4. OMBUDSMEN, YOUR DEVOTION AND PERSERVERANCE IS UNPARALLELED. ON 
BEHALF OF OUR ENTIRE NAVY FAMILY, THANK YOU!
