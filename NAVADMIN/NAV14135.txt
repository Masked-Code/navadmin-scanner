SUBJ/COMMERCIAL SATCOM - IRIDIUM USER INFORMATION// 

REF/A/EMAIL/OPNAV N2N6FP31/10 JAN 14//
AMPN/REF A SENT TO ALL NAVY BUDGET SUBMITTING OFFICES REQUESTING FUNDING 
INFORMATION FOR NAVY COMMAND USAGE OF IRIDIUM.// 

RMKS/1.  The purpose of this NAVADMIN is to provide information to all Navy 
users of the Commercial SATCOM (Iridium) capability. 

2.  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) awarded a new Iridium 
airtime contract on October 22, 2013, which is effective through October 21, 
2018.  One significant change from the previous contract is that the DISA 
Enhance Mobile Satellite Services program will now bill a fixed enterprise 
cost to all Department of Defense (DoD) and Federal Government agency 
customers.  Billing is no longer applied on a per device basis.  There are no 
additional costs for increasing subscriptions and or usage.  The services 
provided are global secure voice, short burst data (SBD), router-based 
unrestricted digital interworking connectivity solution, paging, and 
distributed tactical communication systems (DTCS -also known as Netted 
Iridium).

3.  With this new DISA contract, the services and federal partners are 
required to program funding prior to the start of each fiscal year and pay 
all use with a single bill payer.  Starting FY-2014, (1 October 2013) 
individual Navy commands will no longer pay for Iridium airtime.  The airtime 
will be resourced by OPNAV N2/N6 via a single DISA Program Designator Code 
(PDC).  N2/N6 coordinated with the Office of Budget/Fiscal Management 
Division and the Budget Submitting Offices (BSOs) during the President's 
Budget (PB) FY-2015 to realign BSO Iridium resources to the N2/N6 PDC, 
central budget line item at SPAWAR PB-2015, Program Budget Information System 
(PBIS) Issue 71373.  Individual Navy commands must continue to maintain their 
PDC line of accounting in order to purchase new Iridium communications 
devices, and pay the activation fee for SBD radios, DTCS radios, and DTCS 
networks.  The cost of equipment and activation will be the only costs for 
users. 

4.  All Navy commands utilizing Iridium to meet voice requirements must 
acquire the Iridium 9505A handset, tamper seal, and the Iridium secure module 
through the DISA direct order entry website for connection to the DoD 
enhanced mobile satellite services gateway in Hawaii.  Contact the Navy 
Iridium helpdesk for assistance.
