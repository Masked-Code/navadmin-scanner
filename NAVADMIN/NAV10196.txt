AMPN/OPNAVINST 5530.14E CHAP I, NAVY PHYSICAL SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 
PROGRAM.// 

RMKS/1.  MISHAPS INVOLVING PERSONAL FIREARMS HAVE RESULTED IN SERIOUS INJURY 
AND DEATH.  IN FY08, AT LEAST 28 ACTS OF SAILOR MISCONDUCT OR SUICIDE OCCURRED 
ONBOARD NAVY INSTALLATIONS, AND ANOTHER 111 SUCH INCIDENTS OCCURRED OFF-BASE; 
26 RESULTED IN DEATH.  THIS MESSAGE SUMMARIZES RECENT CHANGES IN POLICY 
INTENDED TO PREVENT THESE TRAGIC MISHAPS.

2.  A RECENT REVIEW OF FIREARMS POLICY RESULTED IN UPDATED GUIDANCE FOR THE 
INTRODUCTION, POSSESSION, AND STORAGE OF PERSONAL WEAPONS ONBOARD NAVY 
INSTALLATIONS.  REF A ESTABLISHES MINIMUM REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
REQUIREMENTS, AND DIRECTS INSTALLATION COMMANDING OFFICERS TO ESTABLISH A 
PROCESS FOR THE STRICT CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF PERSONAL FIREARMS 
AUTHORIZED ONBOARD NAVY INSTALLATIONS.  AN IMPORTANT CHANGE IN POLICY IS THAT 
SAILORS MAY NOW STORE PERSONAL WEAPONS IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS ONBOARD NAVY 
INSTALLATIONS UNDER CAREFULLY CONTROLLED CIRCUMSTANCES AND WITH THE PRIOR 
WRITTEN APPROVAL OF THE INSTALLATION COMMANDING OFFICER. 

3.   INSTALLATION COMMANDING OFFICERS MAY AUTHORIZE THE STORAGE OF PROPERLY 
REGISTERED PERSONAL WEAPONS IN ON-BASE MILITARY FAMILY HOUSING AREAS 
(INCLUDING ON-BASE PUBLIC-PRIVATE VENTURE (PPV) HOUSING) AND IN EXISTING 
ARMORIES.  PERSONAL FIREARMS STORAGE IN OTHER LOCATIONS ON-BASE, SUCH AS 
BACHELOR QUARTERS, AUTOMOBILES, AND WORK CENTERS, IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED. 
A.  PERSONAL FIREARMS MUST BE STORED IN EITHER A LOCKED CONTAINER, A LOCKED 
GUN RACK, OR SECURED WITH AN APPROVED INDIVIDUAL TRIGGER OR CHAMBER-STYLE GUN 
LOCK THAT PREVENTS LOADING OR FIRING.  AMMUNITION MUST BE STORED IN A SEPARATE 
LOCKED CONTAINER. 
B.  INDIVIDUALS STORING PRIVATELY-OWNED FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION IN ON-BASE 
MILITARY FAMILY HOUSING (INCLUDING ON-BASE PPV HOUSING) WILL ENSURE THEY ARE 
INACCESSIBLE TO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS AND MINORS. 

4.  ALL PERSONAL FIREARMS APPROVED BY THE INSTALLATION COMMANDING OFFICER FOR 
TRANSPORT ON A NAVY INSTALLATION SHALL BE TRANSPORTED ONLY AFTER INSTALLATION 
SECURITY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED, THE FIREARMS ARE UNLOADED, AND THEY ARE IN THE 
TRUNK OF THE VEHICLE.  IF THE VEHICLE HAS NO TRUNK, THE FIREARM MUST BE 
DISASSEMBLED, OR SECURED WITH A TRIGGER OR CHAMBER-STYLE LOCK, AND STORED IN A 
LOCKED CONTAINER. AMMUNITION WILL BE TRANSPORTED IN A SEPARATE COMPARTMENT 
FROM THE ONE IN WHICH THE FIREARM IS STORED. 

5.  IN ALL CASES, INDIVIDUALS WILL COMPLY WITH ALL FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL 
LAWS AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING FIREARM OWNERSHIP, POSSESSION, REGISTRATION, 
TRANSPORTATION, AND USE. FURTHERMORE, STATE LICENSE PERMITS TO CARRY CONCEALED 
HANDGUNS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED OR VALID ON NAVY INSTALLATIONS. 

6.  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ALL SAILORS WHO OWN WEAPONS TAKE THEIR 
RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY AND COMPLY WITH REF A.  VIOLATIONS OF THE 
REGULATIONS CONTAINED IN REF A BY MILITARY PERSONNEL MAY SUBJECT THEM TO 
ADMINISTRATIVE AND/OR DISCIPLINARY ACTION UNDER THE UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY 
JUSTICE.  CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINARY ACTION OR 
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION UNDER APPLICABLE CIVILIAN PERSONNEL INSTRUCTIONS. 

7.  FOR FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF NAVY POLICY ON PERSONAL WEAPONS, REFER TO REF 
A, CHAPTER 0306, PARAGRAPH A-H.  NAVY POINT OF CONTACT FOR THIS POLICY IS ERIC 
HAMMETT, OPNAV N46, AT (202) 433-9567 OR E-MAIL:  ERIC.HAMMETT@NAVY.MIL.
