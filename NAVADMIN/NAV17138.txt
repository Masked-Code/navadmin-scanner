Gentext/Remarks/1. This message convenes and provides administrative updates

(TRB).

2. As a result of the Naval Research Working Group (NRWG) meeting aboard the 
Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), 43 Navy sponsors have submitted 291 proposed 
research topics. NPS faculty members have selected those topics on which they 
desire to conduct research during FY18 and have initiated an Initial Research 
Estimate Form (IREF) for each research topic that they desire to have compete 
for NRP funding.  Those IREFs will be reviewed, validated as requirements, 
and allocated funding based on topic sponsor prioritized rankings at the TRB.

3. Per ref A, TRB will be held 24 July 2017 at the Office of Naval Research, 
One Liberty Center, 875 N. Randolph St, Arlington, VA 22203 in conference 
room 1420 in order to review, validate, prioritize, and recommend assignment 
of resources toward the proposed IREFs generated as a result of the NRWG.

4. The TRB is led by the executive director of the Office of Naval Research. 
The board is composed of O6 (or equivalent) representatives from every Navy 
sponsor organization with proposed work for consideration or review.  The TRB 
will verify that the proposed research is relevant, review proposals for 
combining research efforts with other existing or proposed work in order to 
avoid duplication, and recommend assignment of resources toward proposed 
research.  TRB output will be a list of Navy research to be undertaken by the 
students and faculty of NPS for FY18.  The TRB end state is vetted research 
proposals that directly address Navy research requirements and are resourced 
for execution by students and faculty at NPS.

5. Every topic sponsor who has approved at least one IREF is requested to
