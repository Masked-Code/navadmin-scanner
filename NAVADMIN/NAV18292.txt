RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN standardizes execution of Husbanding Service 
Provider (HSP) Program policy by directing an interim change to 
reference (a).  Effective immediately, Fleets, Naval Components, and 
Numbered Fleet Commanders will add the following guidance to reference 
(a) paragraph 5.g.
     a.  Contracting Officer Representatives (COR) on HSP contracts
     will support deployed units including USS and USNS Government-
Owned
     /Government-Operated MSC vessels and specific homeport services
     contracts.  HSP CORs will not be assigned to or conduct 
acceptance
     on non-HSP contracts.
     b.  Continuously enforce cost avoidance procedures with ships
     preparing for port visits (PVST) through effective communication 
and
     coordination among stakeholders.
     c.  Identify conditions and locations whereby CORs provide
     onsite PVST support.  At a minimum, CORs will be onsite for:
            (1) A ships first multi-day PVST in each OCONUS AOR
            (2) Fleet weeks / high visibility exercises / multiple
            ship visits
            (3) CVN / LHD / LHA PVSTs
            (4) Ports anticipating or previously experiencing
            significant logistics challenges
     d.  Deployed units requesting items or quantities in excess of
     approved standard Logistics Requests (LOGREQs) require deviation
     approval.  At a minimum, Numbered Fleet N4s will approve or
     disapprove requests for deviations.  Individual or aggregate
     deviations for a specific PVST equal to or in excess of the
     tripwires listed below, require coordination with the associated
     Type Commander to ensure adequate funding is available:
            (1) COMNAVAIRLANT/COMNAVAIRPAC - $100,000
            (2) COMNAVSURFLANT/COMNAVSURFPAC - $20,000
            (3) COMNAVSUBLANT/COMNAVSUBPAC - $20,000
            (4) Military Sealift Command - $20,000
            (5) Navy Expeditionary Combat Command - $10,000
     e.  Numbered Fleets maintain a log documenting all deviation
     requests and associated actions.
     f.  Fleets and Numbered Fleets review and update their
     standardized LOGREQs quarterly.
     g.  Utilize reference (b) to further standardize processes and
     reinforce training with operational units.  Reference (b) is
     available on the HSPortal system.
