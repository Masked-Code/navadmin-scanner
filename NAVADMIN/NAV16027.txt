SUBJ/2016 ACTIVE DUTY FUND DRIVE IN SUPPORT OF THE NAVY-MARINE CORPS RELIEF 
SOCIETY//

REF/A/DOC/SECNAVINST 5340.7/08FEB1999//

AMPN/REF A IS SECNAVINST 5340.7, ACTIVE DUTY FUND DRIVE IN SUPPORT OF THE 
NAVY-MARINE CORPS RELIEF SOCIETY (NMCRS)//

RMKS/1.  THE NAVY-MARINE CORPS RELIEF SOCIETY'S (NMCRS) ANNUAL ACTIVE DUTY 
FUND DRIVE, DIRECTED BY REFERENCE (A), IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE FUNDS FOR 
THE DIRECT BENEFIT OF OUR SHIPMATES AND FELLOW MARINES.

2.  NMCRS CONTRIBUTES TO MISSION READINESS AND IS OFTEN A LIFELINE WHEN AN 
UNFORESEEN CRISIS EXCEEDS A SAILOR'S ABILITY TO MAKE ENDS MEET.  THE SOCIETY 
RECEIVES NO GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND DEPENDS UPON THE SUPPORT OF ACTIVE DUTY 
AND RETIRED SAILORS AND MARINES TO HELP THOSE IN NEED AT HOME AND AROUND THE 
GLOBE.  USING OUR CONTRIBUTIONS, NMCRS PROVIDES INTEREST-FREE LOANS AND 
GRANTS FOR THOSE FACING FINANCIAL CHALLENGES, THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DISPLACED 
BY NATURAL DISASTERS, OR ARE DEALING WITH UNEXPECTED FAMILY EMERGENCIES.

3.  IN 2015, NEARLY 60,000 SAILORS AND MARINES RECEIVED MORE THAN $45 MILLION 
IN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE NMCRS.  TODAY, MANY NAVY FAMILIES ARE BETTER 
PREPARED TO ADDRESS THE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF MARRIAGE, ARRIVAL OF NEW 
FAMILY MEMBERS, AND CAR AND HOME OWNERSHIP BECAUSE OF THE BUDGET COUNSELING 
AND FINANCIAL EDUCATION PROVIDED BY SOCIETY VOLUNTEERS.  THE SOCIETY HAS KEPT 
FAITH WITH SAILORS.

4.  THIS MARCH IS OUR CHANCE TO GIVE BACK.  THE NMCRS' CAMPAIGN THEME, "BY 
OUR OWN - FOR OUR OWN" EMBODIES THE PRIVILEGE AND OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE TO TAKE 
CARE OF OUR SHIPMATES.  IN 2015, NEARLY TWELVE PERCENT OF SAILORS SUPPORTED 
THE NMCRS THROUGH PAYROLL ALLOTMENT.  I AM GRATEFUL FOR THOSE WHO HAVE 
GENEROUSLY GIVEN IN THE PAST AND AM CONFIDENT THAT, WORKING TOGETHER, WE CAN
ACHIEVE EVEN MORE IN 2016.

5.  THE KEY TO SUCCESS IS ASSIGNING DEDICATED FUND DRIVE COORDINATORS AND KEY 
PEOPLE TO ENSURE 100 PERCENT OF OUR SAILORS ARE AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
LEARN ABOUT THE SOCIETY'S MISSION. I ENCOURAGE ALL OF US WHO ARE ABLE TO GIVE 
TO CONSIDER A CONTRIBUTION TO HELP THOSE OF US IN NEED - WE NEED TO HELP 
OURSELVES THROUGH THE 2016 CAMPAIGN.
