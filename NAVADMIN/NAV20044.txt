3.  Each applicant should take pride in knowing the superior performance 
documented in the evaluations reviewed by the board required the members to 
dedicate long hours in making hard choices to ensure only the best and fully 
qualified applicants were selected.  I am confident that each selectee will 
justify their selection in their career as naval officers.  Those not 
selected are highly encouraged to seek out an LDO in your area for advice on 
ways to grow professionally and improve opportunity for future selection.
Bravo Zulu to all who were willing to answer the call.

4.  This message is not authority to issue appointments.  Frocking is 
prohibited.  COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806) will deliver appointments under 
separate correspondence approximately 60 days prior to the commissioning 
date.

5.  Commanding Officers are directed to:
    a.  Notify selectee.
    b.  Notify PERS-803 via official correspondence not later than
10 days following release of this message of selectees who do not accept 
appointment.  Selectees who decline their commission within this 10 day 
period will be considered by the FY-21 Enlisted Selection Boards.  After the 
10 day period, PERS-802 will invalidate all FY-21 Active-Duty Navy Nuclear 
LDO In-Service Procurement Selection Board selectees eligibility for the FY-
21 Active-Duty Enlisted Selection Boards.
    c.  Per reference (a), ensure LDO selectees obtain a commissioning 
physical within 90 days preceding the appointment month.  Notify the Nuclear 
LDO/CWO Detailer (PERS 422B) upon completion.
    d.  Hold execution of all permanent change of station orders in abeyance, 
if applicable and immediately notify PERS-40 of member's selection.
    e.  Administer official physical fitness assessment (PFA) within
4 months of commissioning date.  Selectees must hand carry test results to 
Officer Indoctrination School, Newport, RI.  If selectee fails to achieve 
Satisfactory Medium score, notify the Nuclear LDO/CWO Detailer (PERS 422B).  
Hold commissioning in abeyance until successful completion of PFA.
    f.  Hold appointment in abeyance if it is determined that a selectee is 
no longer mentally, physically, morally or professionally qualified or if 
they fail to meet PFA requirements.
Immediately forward documentation citing reason to PERS-803.

6.  Nuclear LDO selectees who do not successfully complete a final technical 
interview will maintain their enlisted status and not be commissioned as 
LDOs.  Technical interviews will be scheduled by PERS-422B and selectees 
notified via separate correspondence.

7.  If a LDO selectee's enlistment (including any extensions) expires after 
the date of appointment, they are not reenlistment eligible unless 
appointment is declined.

regard to personal information and history cards, and inform PERS-806 of 
address changes to facilitate appointment delivery.
