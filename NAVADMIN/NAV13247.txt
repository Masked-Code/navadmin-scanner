RMKS /1.  This NAVADMIN announces the observance of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month 
(NDVAM) for the month of October.  In 1989, Congress designated October of that year as NDVAM.  The 
observance provides an opportunity to raise domestic violence awareness, inform service members and 
their families about domestic violence prevention efforts, and reporting options for victims.  This year's 
theme is "Silence Hides Violence."   

2.  Domestic violence happens in all types of families and relationships.  Persons of any class, culture, 
religion, sexual orientation, marital status, age, and gender can be victims or perpetrators of domestic 
violence.  Ref (a) requires Navy personnel to report any suspicion of domestic violence to family 
advocacy.  
Fleet and Family Support Centers (FFSC) along with other community agencies provide services designed 
to promote healthy relationships by reducing family maltreatment.

3.  Navy is absolutely committed to strengthening families and preventing abusive behavior.  We must 
continually strive to create an organizational culture that encourages speaking out and taking action to 
prevent domestic violence incidents.  We cannot remain silent; prevention and intervention programs 
are available for anyone who needs help.

4.  Commands are strongly encouraged to integrate short, key leadership messages into their monthly 
training plans and participate in local NDVAM events sponsored by FFSC.  To facilitate delivery of 
NDVAM messaging and obtain event materials, including discussion scripts, leadership videos, event 
planning materials, and plan of the day/plan of the week notes, contact your local FFSC family advocacy 
manager.  Material will also be available at 
http://www.cnic.navy.mil/ffr/family_readiness/fleet_and_family_
support_program/family_advocacy.html.

5.  Point of contact is Ms. Lolita Allen, Family Advocacy Program/ Victim Advocacy Program at (202)433-
4683 or via e-mail at lolita.allen(at)navy.mil.
