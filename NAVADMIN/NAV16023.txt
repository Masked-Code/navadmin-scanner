SUBJ/INFORMATION DOMINANCE CORPS REDESIGNATED INFORMATION WARFARE COMMUNITY//

MSGID/NAVADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/N2N6/FEB//

RMKS/1.  Effective immediately, the Information Dominance Corps is 
redesignated as the Information Warfare Community.

2.  This redesignation reflects the rising influence of global information 
systems and the increasing rate of technological creation and adoption, as 
reflected in the Chief of Naval Operations A Design for Maintaining Maritime 
Superiority.  This transition also aligns Information Warfare as a 
predominant warfare area.  The name change highlights three fundamental 
capabilities which form the mission of the Information Warfare Community: 
providing sufficient overmatch in command and control, understanding the 
battlespace and adversaries, and projecting power through and across all 
domains.

3.  OPNAV N2N6, in conjunction with key Fleet stakeholders, is developing a 
plan to accomplish the many actions required to reflect the name change (to 
include, but not limited to, updating command names and relevant OPNAV 
instructions and manuals).  Details of this plan will be communicated over 
the coming months.

4.  Designators and ratings within the new Information Warfare Community will 
remain unchanged.  However, the community of officers with the 181X/681X/781X 
designators will be renamed and communicated via separate correspondence.

5.  The OPNAV N2N6 point of contact is CAPT John Lewin at (703) 604-5842/DSN 
664 or via e-mail at john.j.lewin(at)navy.mil.

6.  Released By Vice Admiral Ted N. Branch, Deputy Chief of Navy Operations 
for Information Warfare, N2N6.//
