    j.  The preferred method to submit a LTB is via encrypted e-mail to 
cscselboard(at)navy.mil.  This is still a valid e-mail address for MyNavy 
Career Center (MNCC).  E-mailed LTBs must be encrypted to protect personally 
identifiable information.
    k.  Trouble with the file encryption or certificates or any other 
communication errors that prevent the MNCC from reading a submission do not 
justify a late LTB.  To verify receipt of a LTB, go to 
https://npccontactcenter.ahf.nmci.navy.mil/OA_HTML/npc.html or call the MNCC.  
Although late or unsigned LTBs may be accepted by the MNCC, they will not be 
presented to the board and no feedback will be provided to the candidate.
    l.  If unable to e-mail, candidates may mail a LTB to the addresses 
below.  Mailed LTBs should be on plain white paper and paper clipped (no 
staples, binders, folders or tabs).
