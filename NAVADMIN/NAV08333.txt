AMPN/REF A IS NAVADMIN 082/01, STANDARD ENLISTED RETENTION MEASURES.//

RMKS/1.  THIS MESSAGE SUPERCEDES REF A AND PROMULGATES STANDARD 
ENLISTED RETENTION MEASURES FOR BOTH THE ACTIVE DUTY AND THE SELECTED 
RESERVES (SELRES).

2.  RETAINING QUALITY, TRAINED PERSONNEL IS INTEGRAL TO SHAPING NAVY'S 
TOTAL WORKFORCE TO MEET CURRENT AND FUTURE WARFIGHTING REQUIREMENTS.
WITH THIS IN MIND, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT OUR NAVY HAS ACCURATE, TIMELY, 
AND STANDARDIZED ENLISTED RETENTION DATA.  THE NAVY FIRST STANDARDIZED 
ACTIVE DUTY ENLISTED RETENTION MEASURES IN 2001.  THIS NAVADMIN 
REPRESENTS THE FIRST TIME STANDARD MEASURES ARE FORMALLY ESTABLISHED 
FOR THE SELRES.
ACTIVE DUTY RETENTION MEASURES ARE CALCULATED IN THE NAVY RETENTION 
MONITORING SYSTEM (NRMS), NAVY'S AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE OF RETENTION 
INFORMATION AND THE TOOL USED TO DETERMINE WHICH COMMANDS MEET THE 
FLEET RETENTION EXCELLENCE AWARD CRITERIA.  THE SELRES RETENTION 
MEASURES WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO NRMS IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

3.  THIS PARAGRAPH DEFINES ACTIVE DUTY RETENTION MEASURES.
    A.  THE RETENTION MEASURES WILL BE COMPUTED BY ZONE CONSISTENT WITH 
SRB ZONES A, B AND C.  TWO ADDITIONAL ZONES ARE INCLUDED TO PROVIDE 
PERSONNEL PLANNERS INCREASED CAPABILITY FOR RETENTION ANALYSIS:  ZONE D 
INCLUDES SAILORS WITH OVER
14 UP TO 20 YEARS OF SERVICE, AND ZONE E INCLUDES SAILORS WITH OVER 20 
YEARS OF SERVICE.
    B.  ATTRITION RATE MEASURE.  NAVY'S STANDARD ATTRITION RATE 
MEASURES THE PROPORTION OF SAILORS WHO LEAVE ACTIVE DUTY PRIOR TO 
REACHING THEIR EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE (EAOS).  THE 
ATTRITION RATE IS COMPUTED AS FOLLOWS:
(NON-EAOS LOSSES) DIVIDED BY (NON-EAOS INVENTORY) NOTE 1:  NON-EAOS 
LOSSES ARE LOSSES OCCURRING GREATER THAN 90 DAYS FROM EAOS.
THE EAOS IS COMPUTED TO INCLUDE ALL NON-OPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  NON-EAOS 
LOSSES DO NOT INCLUDE SAILORS WHO ENTER OFFICER COMMISSIONING PROGRAMS, 
NOR ARE HIGH-YEAR TENURE OR EARLY RELEASE LOSSES INCLUDED.
NOTE 2:  NON-EAOS INVENTORY INCLUDES ALL SAILORS WHO ARE GREATER THAN 
90 DAYS FROM EAOS.  WHEN COMPUTING ATTRITION RATE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME 
GREATER THAN ONE MONTH, THE NAVY RETENTION MONITORING SYSTEM USES AN 
AVERAGE OF THE NON-EAOS INVENTORIES FROM EACH MONTH IN THE PERIOD.
NOTE 3:  THE NAVY RETENTION MONITORING SYSTEM ALWAYS, REGARDLESS OF THE 
LENGTH OF THE TIME PERIOD, COMPUTES ATTRITION ON AN ANNUALIZED (12-
MONTH) BASIS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY IN REPORTING.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, IF A COMMAND HAS ONE NON-EAOS LOSS IN A PARTICULAR MONTH 
(PROJECTED TO BE 12 OVER A ONE-YEAR PERIOD) AND A NON-EAOS INVENTORY OF 
100,  THE REPORTED ATTRITION RATE IS 12 PERCENT
((1 NON-EAOS LOSS) TIMES (12 MONTHS) DIVIDED BY (NON-EAOS INVENTORY OF 
100)) VICE ONE PERCENT.
NOTE 4:  NATIONAL CALL TO SERVICE SAILORS ARE NOT COUNTED IN ANY PART 
OF THE ATTRITION RATE MEASURE.
    C.  REENLISTMENT RATE MEASURE.  NAVY'S STANDARD REENLISTMENT RATE 
MEASURES THE PROPORTION OF SAILORS WHO MAKE LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS TO 
STAY ON ACTIVE DUTY UPON REACHING THEIR EAOS.  IT ALSO INCLUDES THOSE 
WHO DECIDE TO REENLIST EARLY.
THE REENLISTMENT RATE IS COMPUTED AS FOLLOWS:  (REENLISTMENTS PLUS LONG 
TERM EXTENSIONS (LTE)) DIVIDED BY (REENLISTMENTS PLUS LTE PLUS EAOS 
LOSSES) NOTE 1:  LTE ARE EXTENSIONS OF 24 MONTHS OR GREATER.  LTE DOES 
NOT INCLUDE THE 24-MONTH EXTENSION INCURRED BY A SIX-YEAR ENLISTMENT 
OBLIGATION.
NOTE 2:  EAOS LOSSES ARE LOSSES OCCURRING AT OR WITHIN 90 DAYS OF THE 
EAOS.
THE EAOS IS COMPUTED TO INCLUDE ALL NON-OPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.
NOTE 3:  ALL HIGH-YEAR TENURE AND EARLY RELEASE LOSSES, REGARDLESS OF 
WHEN THEY OCCUR IN RELATION TO THE EAOS, ARE COUNTED AS EAOS LOSSES.  
SAILORS ENTERING OFFICER COMMISSIONING PROGRAMS ARE NOT COUNTED AS EAOS 
LOSSES.
NOTE 4:  NATIONAL CALL TO SERVICE SAILORS ARE NOT COUNTED IN ANY PART 
OF THE REENLISTMENT RATE MEASURE.
    D.  RESERVE AFFILIATION (RA) MEASURES.  THERE ARE TWO MEASURES, RA 
RATE AND REENLISTMENT RATE WITH RA, WHICH CREDIT THE SAILOR'S LAST 
ACTIVE DUTY COMMAND WITH THE RA.  A RA IS ONLY COUNTED IN THESE 
MEASURES IF THE SAILOR AFFILIATES WITH THE SELECTED RESERVE WITHIN 180 
DAYS OF LEAVING ACTIVE DUTY.  RA RATE IS COMPUTED AS
FOLLOWS:  (RA) DIVIDED BY (EAOS LOSSES ELIGIBLE TO AFFILIATE)
NOTE:  ELIGIBILITY TO AFFILIATE IS DETERMINED BY REENLISTMENT 
ELIGIBILITY CODE.
THE REENLISTMENT RATE WITH RA CONSIDERS RA THE SAME AS A REENLISTMENT 
IN THE REENLISTMENT RATE MEASURE DEFINED IN PARA 3C.  THE REENLISTMENT 
RATE WITH RA IS COMPUTED AS FOLLOWS:  (REENLISTMENTS PLUS LTE PLUS 
RESERVE AFFILIATIONS) DIVIDED BY (REENLISTMENTS PLUS LTE PLUS EAOS 
LOSSES)

4.  A WORKING GROUP CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM DCNO(MPTE), THE 
FLEET, AND THE NAVY RESERVE FORCE ESTABLISHED RETENTION MEASURES THAT 
WILL PROVIDE LEADERSHIP A CLEARER VIEW OF SELRES ATTRITION AND 
REENLISTMENT BEHAVIOR.  THIS PARAGRAPH DEFINES THE SELRES RETENTION 
MEASURES.
    A.  LIKE THE ACTIVE DUTY, SELRES RETENTION MEASURES WILL BE 
COMPUTED BY ZONE, BUT THE ZONES USE PAY ENTRY BASE DATE (PEBD) AND 
ACCOUNT FOR CAREER GATES UNIQUE TO THE SELRES.  SELRES ZONE A INCLUDES 
SAILORS FROM ZERO TO EIGHT YEARS FROM PEBD, WHICH COINCIDES WITH THE 
END OF THE INITIAL MILITARY SERVICE OBLIGATION.  SELRES ZONE B INCLUDES 
SAILORS WITH OVER 8 YEARS UP TO 14 YEARS FROM PEBD, WHICH COINCIDES 
WITH THE SELRES E4 HIGH YEAR TENURE GATE.  SELRES ZONE C INCLUDES 
SAILORS WITH OVER
14 YEARS UP TO 20 YEARS FROM PEBD, WHICH COINCIDES WITH RETIREMENT 
ELIGIBILITY.
SELRES ZONE D INCLUDES SAILORS WITH OVER 20 YEARS AND UP TO 24 YEARS 
FROM PEBD, WHICH COINCIDES WITH THE SELRES E6 AND E7 HIGH YEAR TENURE 
GATE.  SELRES ZONE E INCLUDES SAILORS WITH OVER 24 YEARS FROM PEBD.
    B.  SELRES ATTRITION.  THERE ARE TWO MEASURES, SELRES ATTRITION 
RATE AND SELRES FOCUSED ATTRITION RATE, WHICH MEASURE THE PROPORTION OF 
SAILORS WHO LEAVE A DRILL PAY STATUS MORE THAN 90 DAYS PRIOR TO THE END 
OF OBLIGATED SERVICE (EOS).  SELRES ATTRITION RATE INCLUDES ALL 
ENLISTED LOSSES TO NON-PAY AND IS REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED TO THE OFFICE 
OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE; IT IS COMPUTED AS FOLLOWS:
(NON-EOS LOSSES TO NON-PAY (LNP)) DIVIDED BY (NON-EOS INVENTORY) SELRES 
FOCUSED ATTRITION RATE IS A BETTER INDICATOR OF COMMAND RETENTION 
CLIMATE THAN IS SELRES ATTRITION RATE; IT IS COMPUTED AS FOLLOWS:  
(NON-EOS FOCUSED LOSSES TO NON-PAY (FLNP)) DIVIDED BY (NON-EOS 
INVENTORY) NOTE 1:  THE LARGE MAJORITY OF LNP NOT COUNTED IN FLNP 
INCLUDES TRANSFERS TO ACTIVE DUTY AND TRANSFERS TO THE VOLUNTEER 
TRAINING UNIT FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN ADMINSTRATIVE SEPARATION 
PROCESSING.
NOTE 2:  NON-EOS LNP INCLUDES ALL LOSSES TO NON-PAY OCCURRING GREATER 
THAN 90 DAYS FROM THE EOS.  NON-EOS FLNP INCLUDES ALL FOCUSED LOSSES TO 
NON-PAY OCCURRING GREATER THAN 90 DAYS FROM THE EOS.  THE EOS IS 
COMPUTED TO INCLUDE ALL NON-OPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.
NON-EOS LNP AND NON-EOS FLNP DO NOT INCLUDE SAILORS WHO ENTER OFFICER 
COMMISSIONING PROGRAMS.
NOTE 3:  NON-EOS INVENTORY INCLUDES ALL SELRES SAILORS WHO ARE GREATER 
THAN 90 DAYS FROM EOS.  WHEN COMPUTING ATTRITION MEASURES FOR A PERIOD 
OF TIME GREATER THAN ONE MONTH, THE AVERAGE NON-EOS INVENTORY FROM ALL 
MONTHS IN THE PERIOD WILL BE USED.
NOTE 4:  SELRES ATTRITION MEASURES WILL ALWAYS, REGARDLESS OF THE 
LENGTH OF THE TIME PERIOD, BE REPORTED ON AN ANNUALIZED (12-MONTH) 
BASIS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY IN REPORTING.  NOTE 3 IN PARA 3B 
ILLUSTRATES THE CONCEPT OF REPORTING ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS.
    C.  SELRES REENLISTMENT RATE.  THE SELRES REENLISTMENT RATE 
MEASURES THE PROPORTION OF SAILORS WHO MAKE LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS TO 
STAY IN THE SELRES UPON REACHING THEIR EOS.  IT ALSO INCLUDES THOSE WHO 
DECIDE TO REENLIST EARLY.  THE SELRES REENLISTMENT RATE IS COMPUTED AS 
FOLLOWS:  (REENLISTMENTS PLUS LTE) DIVIDED BY (REENLISTMENTS PLUS LTE 
PLUS EOS FLNP LOSSES) NOTE 1:  LTE ARE EXTENSIONS OF 24 MONTHS OR 
GREATER.
NOTE 2:  EOS FLNP LOSSES ARE FOCUSED LOSSES THAT OCCUR AT OR WITHIN 90 
DAYS OF THE EOS.  THE EOS IS COMPUTED TO INCLUDE ALL NON-OPERATIVE 
EXTENSIONS.
NOTE 3:  ALL FORCED ATTRITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL READY RESERVE AND HIGH-
YEAR TENURE LOSSES, REGARDLESS OF WHEN THEY OCCUR IN RELATION TO THE 
EOS, ARE COUNTED AS EOS LOSSES.  SAILORS ENTERING OFFICER COMMISSIONING 
PROGRAMS ARE NOT COUNTED AS EOS LOSSES.
    D.  TRANSFER TO ACTIVE DUTY (TA) RATE.  THE TA RATE MEASURES THE 
PROPORTION OF SELRES SAILORS WHO VOLUNTARILY TRANSFER TO ACTIVE DUTY; 
IT IS COMPUTED AS FOLLOWS:
(TA) DIVIDED BY (INVENTORY)
NOTE 1:  TA EXCLUDES TRANSFERS DUE TO MOBILIZATION AND ACTIVE DUTY FOR 
SPECIAL WORK.
NOTE 2:  INVENTORY INCLUDES ALL SELRES SAILORS.  WHEN COMPUTING THE 
SELRES TA RATE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME GREATER THAN ONE MONTH, THE AVERAGE 
OF THE INVENTORIES FROM EACH MONTH IN THE PERIOD IS USED.
NOTE 3:  SELRES TA RATE IS ALWAYS, REGARDLESS OF THE LENGTH OF THE TIME 
PERIOD, REPORTED ON AN ANNUALIZED (12-MONTH) BASIS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN 
CONSISTENCY IN REPORTING.  NOTE 3 IN PARA 3B ILLUSTRATES THE CONCEPT OF 
REPORTING ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS.
