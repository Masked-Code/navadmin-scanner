REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/15AUG16//

AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1500.78, FLEET SCHOLARS EDUCATION PROGRAM.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the fiscal year 2019, academic year
(AY) 2019 and 2020 Fleet Scholars Education Program (FSEP).

2.  FSEP is a Navy talent management initiative that is aimed at ensuring the 
highest performing individuals are sought out, encouraged and given an 
opportunity to attend numerous elite and competitive educational programs.  
The goal is to recognize and reward our top talent.  Each of the educational 
opportunities are based on community selection criteria of their top 
performing unrestricted line (URL) and information warfare community (IWC) 
officers.  Selected participants will attend in-residence graduate school at 
an accredited institution of their choice (Continental United States, Alaska 
and Hawaii).

3.  FSEP participants have up to 24 months to complete a graduate degree 
while in a full-time student status.  Distance learning, executive master of 
business administration, night/weekend/part-time programs structured for the 
working professional, medical, and legal education programs are not 
authorized graduate programs under FSEP.

4.  Community sponsors will develop and implement selection criteria and 
policies to identify their most talented and proven performers for FSEP 
participation.  Community sponsors will make selections no later than 31 
October 2018 and submit to Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Manpower, 
Personnel, Training and Education) (N1), Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) 
Civilian Institutions (CIVINS) program office, and Navy Personnel Command, 
Graduate Education and Training Placement (PERS-440) in order to meet AY 19-
20 fall/winter semester/quarter start dates.  The Navy Expeditionary Combat 
Command (NECC, 1140) community selection notification will be made to the 
selectees in December 2018.  FSEP is nominally focused on lieutenant
(O-3) URL and IWC officers.  Each community sponsor may select up to their 
annual allocated graduate education opportunities shown below:
Community    Designator                       Opportunities
AIRFOR       1310, 1320                          (7)
SURFOR       1110                                (9)
SUBFOR       1120                                (5)
NSWC         1130                                (3)
NECC         1140                                (3)
IWC          1810, 1820, 1830                    (3)

5.  Officers who have already received fully funded graduate education are 
not eligible to participate.  This does not include graduate degrees obtained 
through Post 9-11 G.I. Bill, tuition assistance or Navy College Program for 
Afloat College Education.
Selectees will be assigned a unique additional qualification designation for 
purposes of tracking and career management.

6.  Upon notification of selection by the Navy, FSEP selectees should apply 
to at least three accredited graduate education institutions of their choice.  
Participants may be reimbursed for up to three application and transcript 
fees after beginning their first semester/quarter.  Participants shall 
consult the list of schools that already have education service agreements 
(ESA) with the Navy on the NPS CIVINS website FSEP page at 
http://my.nps.edu/web/civins/fsep.  In cases where the school of choice is 
not on the ESA listing, the selectee shall notify the NPS CIVINS office no 
less than 7 months prior to program start to allow sufficient time to pursue 
additional ESAs.  Participants are responsible for researching and completing 
prerequisites including graduate record examinations where applicable.  
Starting enrollment and permanent change of station orders should be for no 
earlier than
1 July 2019 to begin the fall/winter term of AY 19-20.

7.  Service Obligation:  In line with reference (a), FSEP selectees shall 
agree to remain on active-duty for 3 years following graduation or withdrawal 
from the program.  A member who voluntarily or through misconduct fails to 
complete the active-duty time agreed upon shall be required to reimburse the 
cost of the education received, prorated for the obligated time served.

8.  Additional information regarding FSEP is available at the NPS CIVINS 
website at http://my.nps.edu/web/civins/fsep, and in reference (a).

9.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or
31 January 2019, whichever occurs first.
