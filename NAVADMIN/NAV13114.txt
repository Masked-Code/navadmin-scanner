4.  LESSONS LEARNED
    A.  EACH YEAR COMMANDS SUBMIT THEIR SDAP RECERTIFICATIONS ON 31 AUGUST AND 
DO NOT ALLOW TIME FOR ERRORS TO BE CORRECTED PRIOR TO THE DEADLINE.  IN ORDER 
TO AVOID OVERPAYMENTS AND INADVERTENT STOPPAGE OF SDAP, COMMANDS ARE 
ENCOURAGED TO COMPLETE SDAP RECERTIFICATION EARLY IN THE RECERTIFICATION 
WINDOW (PRIOR TO 31 JULY 2013).

STATION ORDERS OR DISTRIBUTION NECS.
SAILORS MUST HOLD THE REQUIRED NECS.

MADE BY NPC DURING THE ANNUAL RECERTIFICATION PROCESS.
