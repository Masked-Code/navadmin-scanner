NAVADMIN and reference (a), this NAVADMIN takes precedence.  This world-class 
program offers deep knowledge of ocean processes, ocean vehicles and 
instrumentation, acoustics, and signal processing.  Furthermore, it seeks to 
enhance understanding and application of operational oceanography as it 
pertains to the Undersea Warfare domain.
