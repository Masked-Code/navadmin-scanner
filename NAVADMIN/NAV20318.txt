RMKS/1.  Reference (a) is a call for every Sailor, active and reserve, and 
civilian to place a positive focus on demonstrating Signature Behaviors to 
drive a Culture of Excellence (COE), where Sailors are included, respected 
and empowered.  The Cultural Champion Network (CCN) is a driver in achieving 
an enduring COE.  In order to achieve this goal this NAVADMIN introduces the 
term *Cultural Champion,* and the concept of the CCN and directs its 
implementation in accordance with reference (b).  Our goal in this effort is 
to develop an environment in which all Sailors:
    a.  Are trained and motivated to navigate life events effectively.
    b.  Assist their Shipmates through periods of stress or difficulty.
    c.  Are attentive to their personal well-being and feel confident seeking 
help from available resources to proactively promote their long-term health.

2.  Reference (b) defines the CCN as an inter-disciplinary network, 
maintained by the command triad, designed to create an integrated Sailor 
support system at each command supported by leaders, partners, processes and 
products.
    a.  The role of the CCN is to:
        (1) Allow leaders to *connect the dots* on issues impacting a 
Sailor*s overall fitness (psychological, spiritual, physical and emotional).
        (2) Clearly identify resources that are needed to ensure resilience 
while fostering toughness and connectedness.
        (3) Improve current operating procedures for Sailor support systems 
across commands.
        (4) Drive commands towards unit mission readiness and a stronger 
foundation for the future by promoting positive behaviors and healthy norms 
at all levels.

3.  Through the CCN, the command triad will implement the following in 
accordance with references (b) through (g):
    a.  Ensure every member of the CRT completes the Basic Primary Prevention 
and Human Factors Process (HFP) online training available at 
https://erau.edu/navy-crt-training.  To register for training, members must 
enter code 8LKE79.
    b.  Ensure Command Resilience Team Human Factors Councils
(CRTHFCs) are designed to review the human factors that impact the wellness 
of individuals within the command and identify primary prevention efforts to 
reduce relevant risk(s).  CRTHFC training is located on the COE Webpage (see 
paragraph 6) and will be available on 31 December 2020.  CRTHFC mandatory 
members identified in reference (b) shall additionally complete the 
Intermediate Primary Prevention and HFP online training available at 
https://erau.edu/navy-crt- training.  The training will be available on 31 
January 2021.  Basic Primary Prevention and HFP online training is a 
prerequisite for the intermediate training.
    c.  Ensure deckplate leadership engagement with CRT members to provide 
commanders with a better understanding of issues impacting Sailor resilience, 
implement positive measures to promote Sailor well-being, build resilience 
and make Sailors and commands more combat ready.

4.  Similar processes may be already conducted in the Fleet (e.g., Force 
Preservation Councils or SUBFOR*s TOBI Program) that meet the goals and 
intent identified herein.  Commands already utilizing these existing non-
punitive processes are encouraged to continue to do so and leverage the tools 
provided within reference (b) to enhance functions.

5.  The 21ST Century Sailor Office (OPNAV N17) will incorporate CCN 
requirements across OPNAV N17 programs and policies in support of COE 
initiatives.  Command inspections to ensure all commands execute the 
requirements of this NAVADMIN will be conducted by Command Climate 
Specialists and the Navy Inspector General.  The provisions of this NAVADMIN 
and Fleet best-practices for executing CRTs and CRTHFCs identified during 
command inspections will be incorporated into a forthcoming CCN instruction 
scheduled for release in 2021.  The provisions of this NAVADMIN must be fully 
implemented at each command no later than 1 March 2021.

6.  Reference (a) and all links and resources for the COE may be found on the 
Navy Personnel Command website via My Navy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/sailor-and-family-support under the 21ST 
Century Sailor tab, then Culture of Excellence.

7.  Point of contact is OSCM(SW/AW) Jerald Baker, who can be reached at (901) 
874-2487/DSN 882-2487 or via e-mail at jerald.d.baker(at)navy.mil.

8.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
