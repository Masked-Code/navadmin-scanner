SUBJ/ENROLLMENT IN THE EXCEPTIONAL FAMILY MEMBER PROGRAM//

REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/3NOV10/
AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1754.2D, EXCEPTIONAL FAMILY MEMBER PROGRAM.// 

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN directs commands to review their Exceptional Family 
Member Program (EFMP) enrolled sponsors within their units and ensure service 
members have a current EFMP enrollment status.  Currently over 25 percent of 
family members enrolled in the Navy's EFMP have an expired enrollment status.  
An expired enrollment status causes delays in the assignment process until 
the EFM's enrollment is updated.

2.  Per ref (a), service members should ensure their enrollment is updated 12 
months prior to negotiating for orders, or a permanent change of station.  At 
a minimum, service members are required to update their enrollment status 
every three years or whenever a family member's condition changes.

3.  If the status of a Sailors EFMP changes through divorce, death, or no 
longer residing with the service member due to court-ordered change in 
custody, the command should provide the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) EFMP 
coordinator with an official letter requesting disenrollment.

4.  All commands are directed to ensure an EFMP command point of contact 
(POC) is identified in writing and that enrollment statuses of EFMP sponsors 
are reviewed at least quarterly to ensure enrollment statuses are current.
    a.  Commands shall review Enlisted Data Verification Reports And Officer 
Distribution Control Reports to identify EFMP enrolled sponsors.
    b.  Automated messages will be sent to commands notifying them of 
enrolled sponsors whose status needs to be updated.  Commands shall ensure 
that identified sponsors update their EFMP enrollment.
    c.  POC for enrollment verification is Ms. Ricka Socha, PERS-456, at 901-
874-4149/DSN 874 or via e-mail at ricka.socha(at)navy.mil.

5.  POC for the EFM Program is CDR David Mater, PERS-456, at (901) 874-
2435/DSN 874 or via e-mail at david.mater(at)navy.mil.
