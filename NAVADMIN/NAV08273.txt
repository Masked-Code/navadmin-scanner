THE RETENTION OF OUR SAILORS.

VOLUNTARY EDUCATION TO ENABLE SAILORS TO OBTAIN A COLLEGE DEGREE ON 
ACTIVE DUTY.  TO SUPPORT THIS OBJECTIVE NCP PROVIDES SAILORS THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLETE THEIR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION BY EARNING AN 
EQUIVALENCY DIPLOMA, IMPROVE READING AND MATH LITERACY LEVELS, AND

DEGREE PROGRAMS.

SKILLS, AND NCPACE.  WHILE ON ACTIVE DUTY, NAVY OFFERS TUITION 
ASSISTANCE TO ACTIVE-DUTY SAILORS FOR COURSES OFFERED BY OVER ONE 
THOUSAND ACCREDITED COLLEGES, UNIVERSITIES OR VOCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.  
THE ACADEMIC SKILLS PROGRAM PROVIDES THE EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION TO 
ENHANCE SUCCESS IN HIGHER EDUCATION.  ACADEMIC SKILLS PREPARE SAILORS

RATING.  FOR DEPLOYED SAILORS, THE NAVY COLLEGE PROGRAM FOR AFLOAT 
COLLEGE EDUCATION (NCPACE) PROVIDES ACADEMIC SKILLS AND COLLEGE 
(UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE) COURSES.  NCPACE IS DELIVERED VIA 
INSTRUCTOR-LED AND DISTANCE LEARNING.  
4.  BECAUSE SAILORS' EDUCATION PURSUITS ARE COMPETING WITH DEMANDS OF 
WORK AND FAMILY, NAVY HAS PARTNERED WITH APPROXIMATELY 30 ACADEMIC 
INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE NAVY COLLEGE PROGRAM DISTANCE LEARNING 
PARTNERSHIP (NCPDLP).  NCPDLP ALLOWS MAXIMUM USE OF MILITARY TRAINING 
AND EXPERIENCE, AND COLLEGE LEVEL TESTS TO FULFILL DEGREE REQUIREMENTS 
THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING METHODS AT AN ACCELERATED RATE.
