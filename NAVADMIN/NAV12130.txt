REF/B/DOC/SECNAV/23MAY11//
REF/C/DOC/OPNAV/4JUN09//
NARR/REF A IS INITIATION OF EXPANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUG URINALYSIS 
TESTING.  REF B IS SECNAVINST 5300.28E, MILITARY SUBSTANCE ABUSE 
PREVENTION AND CONTROL.  REF C IS OPNAVINST 5350.4D, NAVY ALCOHOL 
AND DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL.//

RMKS/1.  EFFECTIVE 1 MAY 2012, NAVY DRUG SCREENING LABS WILL ADD TWO 
MORE COMMONLY ABUSED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO THE STANDARD TESTING PANEL 
FOR ALL URINALYSIS SAMPLES SUBMITTED FOR TESTING.  THE PRESCRIPTION 
DRUG FAMILIES TESTED WILL NOW INCLUDE BENZODIAZEPINES AND HYDROCODONES 
(E.G. XANAX, VICODIN).  THESE DRUG FAMILIES ARE POTENTIALLY HIGHLY 
ADDICTIVE, AND THEIR USE OUTSIDE OF MEDICAL SUPERVISION PLACES THE 
SAILOR, THEIR FAMILY AND SHIPMATES AT RISK.  

2.  SAILORS SHOULD ENSURE AUTHORIZED PRESCRIPTIONS ARE PROPERLY 
DOCUMENTED IN THEIR MEDICAL RECORD, PER REFS A AND B.  SAILORS WHO ARE 
CURRENTLY USING DRUGS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PRESCRIBED OR USING THEM 
INAPPROPRIATELY ARE ENCOURAGED TO VOLUNTARILY SEEK MEDICAL TREATMENT 
AND REHABILITATION IN A MILITARY MEDICAL FACILITY ON A SELF-REFERRAL 
BASIS PRIOR TO INITIATION OF THIS NEW TESTING PROTOCOL.  NAVY MEDICAL 
TREATMENT FACILITIES ARE READY TO ASSIST ANY SAILOR OR FAMILY MEMBER 
WHO SELF-REFERS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG MISUSE OR ABUSE.

3.  NAVY'S POLICY IS ZERO TOLERANCE FOR DRUG ABUSE.  PER REF C, 
SAILORS WHOSE URINALYSIS SAMPLES ARE IDENTIFIED POSITIVE FOR CONTROLLED 
SUBSTANCES FOR WHICH THEY DO NOT HAVE A VALID PRESCRIPTION RECORDED IN 
THEIR MEDICAL RECORD MAY BE CONSIDERED IN VIOLATION OF THE UCMJ FOR 
DRUG MISUSE/ABUSE.  PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE INAPPROPRIATELY USED WHEN 
THEY ARE USED OUTSIDE THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE, BEYOND THEIR PRESCRIBED 
DATES, IN EXCESS OF THE PRESCRIBED DOSING REGIMEN, OR WHEN A SAILOR 
USES ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL'S PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS.

4.  POINT OF CONTACT IS MS. DORICE S. FAVORITE, DIRECTOR, NAVY ALCOHOL 
AND DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION OFFICE, (901) 874-4400/DSN 882-4400 OR VIA
