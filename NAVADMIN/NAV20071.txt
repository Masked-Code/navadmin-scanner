SUBJ/PHYSICAL READINESS POLICY UPDATE//

REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/11JUL11//

NARR/REF A IS OPNAVINST 6110.1J, PHYSICAL READINESS PROGRAM.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces immediate suspension of the Navy physical 
readiness program physical fitness assessment (PFA) for Cycle 1, 2020 to 
minimize the risk from COVID-19 to Sailors and adhere to social distancing 
requirements.  All personnel will be excused from participation in Cycle 1, 
2020, including those who have already completed the PFA.

2.  Suspension includes both the official Body Composition Assessment and 
Physical Readiness Test components of the PFA.
    a.  All official PFA records affected by this policy will be updated by 
the Physical Readiness Program office.  The Physical Readiness Program office 
will work with Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS) On-line to *EXCUSE* all 
Service Members in the Physical Readiness Information Management System 
(PRIMS) for Cycle 1, 2020.
Commands that have already begun or completed the official PFA testing should 
stop immediately and take no further action in PRIMS.
Commands that have not started the PFA should not enter any data in PRIMS for 
Cycle 1 2020.
    b.  All Navy commands are directed to immediately suspend all organized 
or group physical training (PT) (i.e. Command, Department or Division PT and 
the Fitness Enhancement Program) until further notice.
    c.  Exceptions to paragraph 2.a and 2.b for accessions missions (e.g. 
recruit training) and unit mission training requirements may be granted by 
the appropriate Echelon II commander with authority to delegate to the first 
flag officer in the chain of command.

3.  Enlisted Service Members with a Soft End of Active Obligated Service 
before 30 July 2020 who are ineligible for retention or cannot submit a 
Career Waypoint (C-WAY) application due to adverse evaluations as a result of 
past PFA failure history and desire to stay Navy are authorized an extension 
to regain eligibility with command endorsement as follows:
     a.  Requested extension length should be of sufficient duration to allow 
for processing of a future special evaluation and application in C-WAY (if 
applicable), but must not exceed 30 September 2020.
     b.  Because this is an exception to policy, this action will not require 
a C-WAY quota (if applicable).
     c.  Once the Service Member successfully passes the official Cycle 2, 
2020 PFA and has retention eligibility restored from the Commanding Officer 
(CO), the Service Member can submit their reenlistment/extension request 
directly to their CO, or BUPERS Enlisted Community Manager for enlisted 
Service Members who must use C-WAY.  For Nuclear-trained Service Members, all 
requests must be submitted via their CO to Deputy Chief of Naval Operations 
Nuclear Program Manager.  In all cases, PRIMS results must show the Cycle 2,
2020 results.

4.  Officers who may be impacted by this NAVADMIN should contact the Officer 
Performance and Separations Branch.

5.  Points of Contact.
    a.  Physical Readiness Program.  AMCS Eric Anderson, Physical Fitness 
Branch, at (901)-874-4376, DSN 882 or via email at eric.anderson(at)navy.mil.
    b.  Personnel Issues.  MyNavy Career Center, 1-833-330-6622 or via e-mail 
at askmncc(at)navy.mil.

6.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.

7.  Released by Vice Admiral John B. Nowell, Jr, N1.//
