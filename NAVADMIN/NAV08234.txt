130/06, SEA SHORE ROTATION (SSR) TOUR LENGTH REVISIONS.// RMKS/1.  THIS 
NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SEA SHORE FLOW
(SSF) ENLISTED CAREER PATHS AND REPRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE 
WAY THE NAVY DEFINES AND MANAGES ENLISTED SEA TOUR LENGTHS.  IT 
REPLACES THE EXISTING SEA SHORE ROTATION (SSR) TOUR LENGTHS NAVADMIN 
AND SHOULD BE READ IN ITS ENTIRETY.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEA 
SHORE FLOW, INCLUDING A COMPARISON OF SEA TOUR LENGTHS UNDER THE NEW 
SEA SHORE FLOW ENLISTED CAREER PATHS VICE SEA SHORE ROTATION TOUR 
LENGTHS, CAN BE FOUND AT 
HTTP://WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/ABOUTUS/BUPERS/TOTALFORCEDIV/.
2.  TRADITIONALLY, THE NAVY HAS BEEN AND WILL ALWAYS REMAIN, FIRST AND 
FOREMOST, THE PREEMINENT SEA-GOING SERVICE.  HOWEVER, OVER THE LAST 
SEVERAL YEARS, THE NAVY HAS BECOME AND IS PROJECTED TO CONTINUE TO 
BECOME INCREASINGLY SEA-CENTRIC.  THIS IS DUE IN PART TO BILLET 
STRUCTURE CHANGES THAT HAVE REDUCED BILLETS ASHORE WHILE INCREASING THE 
NEED FOR MORE EXPERIENCED YET FEWER SAILORS AT SEA.  THE TRANSITION TO 
A MORE SEA-CENTRIC NAVY HAS NECESSITATED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS NEW 
SEA SHORE FLOW MANNING CONSTRUCT TO ENSURE PROPER MANNING OF ALL SEA 
DUTY AND FRONT LINE OPERATIONAL BILLETS.  
AT THE SAME TIME, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A DESIRABLE LIFE/WORK BALANCE 
OVER A SAILOR'S CAREER, THE NAVY RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO OFFSET THE 
ARDUOUS NATURE OF SEA DUTY WITH PREDICTABLE PERIODS OF MEANINGFUL WORK 
ASHORE.  SEA SHORE FLOW PROVIDES THE OPTIMAL BALANCE BETWEEN SEA DUTY 
AND SHORE DUTY WHILE IMPROVING FIT (RIGHT SAILOR, RIGHT PLACE, RIGHT 
TIME) TO THE FLEET.  FOR SAILORS THIS MEANS THAT SEA TOUR LENGTHS WILL 
NO LONGER BE DETERMINED BY THEIR PAY GRADE, BUT RATHER BY THEIR 
EXPERIENCE LEVEL IN TERMS OF SEA TOURS COMPLETED.  
SEA SHORE FLOW WILL ENHANCE THE STABILITY AND IMPROVE THE 
PREDICTABILITY OF THE CAREER PATHS FOR EVERY SAILOR IN A SEA-CENTRIC 
NAVY.  IN FACT, MOST SAILORS WILL SEE EITHER NO CHANGE OR A DECREASE IN 
SEA TOUR LENGTHS AS THE NAVY MOVES CLOSER TO ACHIEVING DESIRED FIT.  
SAILORS IN VERY SEA-INTENSIVE COMMUNITIES WILL BENEFIT FROM PROGRAMS 
LIKE SEA DUTY INCENTIVE PAY (SDIP) OR EXTENDED GEOGRAPHIC STABILITY FOR 
VOLUNTEERING TO SERVE MORE TIME AT SEA OR FOR SIGNING UP FOR BACK-TO-
BACK SEA TOURS.
3.  THE SEA SHORE FLOW ENLISTED CAREER PATHS ANNOUNCED IN THIS MESSAGE 
APPLY TO ALL ACTIVE DUTY ENLISTED PERSONNEL AND SUPERSEDE THE SEA SHORE 
ROTATION TOUR LENGTHS ANNOUNCED IN REF A.  HIGH YEAR TENURE (HYT) 
LIMITS REMAIN IN EFFECT.  CURRENT FULL-TIME SUPPORT
(FTS) SEA/SHORE ROTATION POLICY WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL COMPLETION 
OF THE INITIATIVE TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE OPERATIONAL RESERVE.
4.  COMNAVPERSCOM WILL ADJUST PROJECTED ROTATION DATES (PRDS) BASED ON 
LENGTH OF TOUR REMAINING.  IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE TURBULENCE IN PERSONAL 
PLANNING, PRDS OF OCT 09 OR EARLIER WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED.
COMNAVPERSCOM IS AUTHORIZED TO ADJUST A PRD TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL SEA 
TOUR EXPERIENCE FOR SAILORS WHO ARE CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO A SEA TOUR.  
THIS DECISION WILL BE MADE BASED ON OVERALL MANNING IN THE COMMAND, 
PROJECTION OF FUTURE ROTATIONS TO FILL THE NEW PRD, AND ENHANCEMENT TO 
THE CAREER DEVELOPMENT OF THE SAILOR.
