GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  TO ENSURE OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS NOW AND IN
THE FUTURE, NAVY MUST BOTH RETAIN THE TALENTS OF OUR SAILORS AND
ATTRACT AND COMPETE FOR THE HIGHEST QUALITY RECRUITS POSSIBLE.  THIS
STRATEGY FOR OUR PEOPLE REQUIRES FLEXIBLE TOOLS TO ENSURE WE ARE
ALSO RETAINING THE CORRECT NUMBER OF SAILORS WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS
TO OPTIMIZE OUR WAR-FIGHTING CAPABILITY.  THE SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT
BONUS PROGRAM FOR DESIGNATED NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATIONS IS
PROVIDED AS AN INCENTIVE TO MEET CURRENT OR FUTURE FLEET
REQUIREMENTS, AND ALLOWS AWARD LEVELS TO BE ADJUSTED AS NECESSARY.
2.  THIS NAVADMIN SUPERCEDES NAVADMINS 070/05, 100/05, AND 109/05
AND PROVIDES NEW AWARD LEVELS.  INCREASED AWARD LEVELS ARE EFFECTIVE
13 JANUARY 2006 AND DECREASED AWARD LEVELS ARE EFFECTIVE 13 FEBRUARY
2006.  ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES IN THE DEFENSE JOINT MILITARY PAY
SYSTEM PROCEDURES TRAINING GUIDE REMAIN IN EFFECT.
3.  NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION SPECIFIC SELECTIVE REEENLISTMENT
BONUS.  ACCEPTANCE OF A NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION SPECIFIC
SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS CONTRACT INDICATES AWARENESS OF AN
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE SAILOR AND THE NAVY TO UTILIZE THE SKILLS
ATTRIBUTED TO THE NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION DURING THE SAILOR'S
ENLISTMENT TO MEET FLEET READINESS REQUIREMENTS.  IN SUBSEQUENT
TOURS A SAILOR MUST BE WILLING TO BE DETAILED DURING THE NORMAL
PROJECTED ROTATION DATE WINDOW TO A BILLET AVAILABLE WITHIN THE
SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS CONTRACTED NAVY ENLISTED
CLASSIFICATION, CONSISTENT WITH SEA-SHORE ROTATION REQUIREMENTS.
4.  INFORMATION ON INCREASED AND DECREASED AWARD LEVELS.  AN
ELIGIBLE MEMBER WITH A COMNAVPERSCOM APPROVED SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT
BONUS REQUEST WHO HAS NOT YET REENLISTED OR EXECUTED A SELECTIVE
REENLISTMENT BONUS QUALIFYING EXTENSION AND WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM A
HIGHER AWARD LEVEL UNDER THIS PLAN MUST RESUBMIT A SELECTIVE
REENLISTMENT BONUS REENLISTMENT REQUEST TO QUALIFY FOR A HIGHER
AWARD LEVEL.  A MEMBER IN A SKILL LISTED FOR REDUCTION OR
TERMINATION OF AWARD LEVEL WHO HAS AN APPROVAL MESSAGE OR A PENDING
PRECERT FOR A REENLISTMENT DATE AFTER 13 FEBRUARY 2006 MUST RESUBMIT
A REENLISTMENT REQUEST FOR A NEW REENLISTMENT DATE PRIOR TO 13
FEBRUARY 2006 TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE HIGHER AWARD LEVEL.  INDICATE
THE DATE-TIME-GROUP OF THE ORIGINAL COMNAVPERSCOM PRECERT RESPONSE
IN THE REMARKS SECTION OF THE NEW REENLISTMENT REQUEST SO THE
ORIGINAL REQUEST CAN BE CANCELLED.
5.  PERFORM-TO-SERVE REQUIREMENTS.  A REQUEST FOR A MEMBER WHO
REQUIRES PERFORM-TO-SERVE APPROVAL BEFORE REENLISTING SHALL NOT BE
SUBMITTED UNTIL THE MEMBER HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THEIR
PERFORM-TO-SERVE APPROVAL.  ANY REQUEST SUBMITTED IN ADVANCE OF
PERFORM-TO-SERVE APPROVAL WILL BE DISAPPROVED.  THE STATUS OF
PERFORM-TO-SERVE APPROVAL MAY BE VIEWED ON THE OFFICER PERSONNEL
INFORMATION SYSTEM UZ4/UN4 SCREEN.
6.  REENLISTMENT PROCEDURES.  A MEMBER MAY REQUEST TO REENLIST FOR A
SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS ANY TIME WITHIN THE SAME FISCAL YEAR AS
THEIR EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE.  IT IS RECOMMENDED
THAT A MEMBER REENLIST AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THEIR EXPIRATION OF
ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE TO PRESERVE THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF THEIR
SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS PAYMENT.  BECAUSE A SELECTIVE
REENLISTMENT BONUS IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF MONTHS FOR
WHICH A MEMBER REENLISTS BEYOND HIS OR HER CURRENT EXPIRATION OF
ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE, REENLISTING EARLY REDUCES THE SELECTIVE
REENLISTMENT BONUS PAYMENT.  A MEMBER WHO MUST OBLIGATE SERVICE TO
EXECUTE A PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION MOVE MAY REENLIST ANY TIME
WITHIN THE SAME FISCAL YEAR AS THE DETACHMENT MONTH, BUT NOT LATER
THAN THE DATE OF DETACHMENT FROM THE LAST INTERMEDIATE DUTY STATION.
A MEMBER WHO MUST OBLIGATE SERVICE TO EXECUTE A HOMEPORT CHANGE
CERTIFICATE MOVE MAY REENLIST ANY TIME WITHIN THE SAME FISCAL YEAR
AS THE SHIFT MONTH.  A SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS REENLISTMENT
UNDER THE SELECTIVE TRAINING AND REENLISTMENT PROGRAM FOR PERSONNEL
OTHER THAN THOSE QUALIFIED IN NUCLEAR PROPULSION ARE LIMITED TO
EXECUTION WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THEIR EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED
SERVICE.
7.  OBLIGATE SERVICE TO TRAIN AND THEN REENLIST.  A MEMBER WHO IS
NOT ELIGIBLE FOR A SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS IN THEIR PRESENT
RATING OR WHO DOES NOT HOLD A SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS ELIGIBLE
NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION MAY QUALIFY FOR A SELECTIVE
REENLISTMENT BONUS IF THEY CONVERT TO, OR TRAIN FOR, A SELECTIVE
REENLISTMENT BONUS ELIGIBLE SKILL.  THE MEMBER MUST AGREE TO
OBLIGATE SERVICE TO TRAIN FOR THE SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS-NAVY
ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION AND THEN REENLIST AFTER THE NEW NAVY
ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION IS ATTAINED OR RATING CONVERSION IS
COMPLETED.  THE NEW RATING OR NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION MUST BE
DESIGNATED FOR AWARD OF A SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS AT THE TIME
OF THE AGREEMENT TO OBLIGATE SERVICE TO TRAIN.  A SELECTIVE
REENLISTMENT BONUS MAY BE PAID FOR THAT SPECIALTY:
    A.  IF ELIGIBLE TO CHANGE RATINGS OR TO TRAIN FOR THE NAVY
ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION AND DESIGNATION PER THE MANUAL OF NAVY
ENLISTED MANPOWER AND PERSONNEL CLASSIFICATIONS AND OCCUPATIONAL
STANDARDS (NAVPERS 18068).
    B.  IF APPROVED FOR THIS OPTION BY THE MEMBER'S DETAILER
(COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-40XX)) AND ENLISTED COMMUNITY MANAGER
(COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4011)).
    C.  UPON COMPLETION OF QUALIFICATION TRAINING AND REENLISTMENT
IN THE SPECIALTY.
    D.  AT THE AWARD LEVEL IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE AGREEMENT OR
AT THE AWARD LEVEL IN EFFECT AT REENLISTMENT, WHICHEVER IS HIGHER
(AND AS DETAILED IN THE APPROVED SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS
PRECERT).  IF A MEMBER CROSSES ZONES BETWEEN OBLIGATED SERVICE TO
TRAIN APPROVAL AND REENLISTMENT, THE MEMBER CAN ONLY RECEIVE THE
REENLISTMENT BONUS APPLICABLE TO THE NEW ZONE.
    E.  IF OTHERWISE QUALIFIED UNDER THE SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT
BONUS ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.
    F.  IF THE SPECIALTY FOR WHICH THE MEMBER IS RECEIVING TRAINING
IS NO LONGER DESIGNATED FOR A SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS AWARD AT
THE TIME OF GRADUATION FROM TRAINING, THE MEMBER IS STILL AUTHORIZED
FOR THE AWARD LEVEL THAT WAS IN EFFECT THE DAY THAT THE OBLIGATION
OF SERVICE TO TRAIN WAS APPROVED.  A SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS
ELIGIBLE MEMBER CANNOT USE THIS OPTION TO DELAY REENLISTMENT TO
ACQUIRE ADVANCE TRAINING OR OTHER NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION TO
QUALIFY FOR A HIGHER PAYING AWARD LEVEL.  A MEMBER WHO CAN COMPLETE
TRAINING REQUIREMENTS BEFORE THEIR EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED
SERVICE IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THIS OPTION.  THE ABOVE CRITERIA SHALL
NOT BE WAIVED.  AFTER APPROVAL OF OBLIGATE SERVICE TO TRAIN AND
WITHIN 35-120 DAYS OF SCHOOL GRADUATION, THE REENLISTING SAILOR'S
COMMAND MUST SUBMIT A REQUEST TO REENLIST FOR A SELECTIVE
REENLISTMENT BONUS UNDER CODE 1CC IN THE TYPE AND CITE "OBLISERV TO
TRAIN AND THEN REENLIST" IN THE REMARKS SECTION ON THE PRECERT.
8.  COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES. A COMMAND MUST SUBMIT A
SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS REENLISTMENT REQUEST BETWEEN 35-120
DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE MEMBER'S EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED
SERVICE OR REENLISTMENT DATE TO ENSURE THE APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL
MESSAGE WILL REACH MEMBER'S COMMAND AND THE DEFENSE FINANCE AND
ACCOUNTING SERVICE BEFORE THE REENLISTMENT DATE.  TIMELINESS IS
CRITICAL BECAUSE THE APPROVED PRECERT NOTIFIES THE DEFENSE JOINT
MILITARY PAY SYSTEM OF THE MEMBERS INTENT TO REENLIST, PREVENTS
INTERRUPTION OF PAY, AND ENSURES THE INITIAL SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT
BONUS PAYMENT POSTS TO THE MEMBER'S ACCOUNT.  A MEMBER MUST HAVE AN
APPROVED PRECERT BEFORE REENLISTING, THOUGH THEY MAY WAIT TO
REENLIST UP TO THEIR EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE.  A
MEMBER WITH AN APPROVED PRECERT WHO DOES NOT REENLIST ON THE DATE
SPECIFIED ON THE PRECERT MESSAGE MUST CONTACT COMNAVPERSCOM
(PERS-4811F) (SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS EXECUTION SECTION AND
HELP DESK).  A COMMAND INITIATING A SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS
PRECERT MUST ENSURE ALL OF THE DATA INCLUDED IN THE PRECERT REQUEST
MATCHES DATA IN THE MEMBER'S SERVICE RECORD OR THE COMMAND'S
ENLISTED DISTRIBUTION VERIFICATION REPORT.  MANY SELECTIVE
REENLISTMENT BONUS REQUESTS ARE REJECTED DUE TO ERRONEOUS DATA
(E.G., SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, ACTIVE DUTY START DATE, OR EXPIRATION
OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE) OR DATA THAT CONFLICTS WITH THE
ENLISTED MASTER FILE.
9.  CANCELLATION OF NON-OPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  ANY MEMBER MAY CANCEL
UP TO 24 MONTHS OF A NON-OPERATIVE EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT PROVIDED:
    A.  THE EXTENSION IS CANCELLED BEFORE IT BECOMES OPERATIVE.
    B.  THE MEMBER IMMEDIATELY REENLISTS FOR AT LEAST 2 YEARS BEYOND
THE EXTENDED EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE, DAY-FOR-DAY.
THE CANCELLED INOPERATIVE EXTENSION WILL COUNT AGAINST MEMBER'S
SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS AWARD UNLESS THE REENLISTMENT IS FOR
GREATER THAN THE PERIOD OF THE INOPERATIVE EXTENSION PLUS 2 YEARS.
10.  PRECERT REQUIREMENTS.  THE FOLLOWING ARE REQUIRED WHEN
SUBMITTING PRECERT REQUESTS:
     A.  TO VALIDATE AN OPERATIVE EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT AND TO
EXPEDITE PROCESSING OF A SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS REQUEST,
INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN THE REMARKS PARAGRAPH OF THE REQUEST:
TERM, NARRATIVE REASON, AUTHORITY, AND EXECUTION DATE OF ALL
OPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  FAILURE TO VERIFY EXTENSIONS WILL RESULT IN
REJECTION OF THE REQUEST AND MAY DELAY ITS PROCESSING.
     B.  A CONDITIONAL EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT (ANY EXTENSION LESS
THAN 24 MONTHS) MUST MEET THE REASONS AND TERMS SPECIFIED IN
OPNAVINST 1160.6A AND MILPERSMAN 1160-040 AND 1160-080 AND MUST BE
APPROVED BY COMNAVPERSOM (PERS-4811).  FAILURE TO GET AN APPROVAL
FOR EXTENSION MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS
ELIGIBILITY.
     C.  PERSONNEL IN A CLOSED LOOP NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION CAN
REENLIST BY THE NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION ONLY.
11.  REVISED AWARD PLAN.  A "-" SYMBOL PRECEDING AN AWARD LEVEL
INDICATES A DECREASE TO THAT AWARD LEVEL FOR THAT SPECIFIC ZONE.  A
"+" SYMBOL PRECEDING AN AWARD LEVEL FOR A SPECIFIC ZONE OR PRECEDING
A RATING INDICATES AN INCREASE TO THAT AWARD LEVEL FOR THAT SPECIFIC
ZONE OR THE ADDITION OF THE RATING TO THE SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT
BONUS AWARD PLAN.
