6.  Eligibility Criteria.  Candidates must meet the eligibility requirements 
outlined in chapters 2 and 11 of reference (a) and this NAVADMIN prior to the 
scheduled board convening date.  All requirements must reflect in the 
respective EMF prior to the board convening.  Requirements achieved or posted 
to the record of the candidate after the scheduled board convening date are 
considered late and will not make a candidate eligible for the regularly 
scheduled board or entitle a candidate to an enlisted special selection 
board.  Refer to paragraph 616 of reference (a) for E-8 through E-9 candidate 
validation procedures.  Eligibility requirements include:
    a.  The name of the candidate appears on the selection board eligibility 
list in the correct competitive group on their profile sheet.  Candidates 
should register for e-mail notification for profile sheet updates via MNP at
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/navy-advancement-center/my-
advancement.  Candidates and commands share equal responsibility to ensure 
the eligibility list is accurate.  Because eligibility status can change 
without direct notification, candidates should verify their profile sheet on 
a continuous basis and commands must verify their ESVR weekly through the 
projected board adjourn date.
    b.  In line with reference (a), the terminal eligibility date used to 
compute the TIR is 1 October 2020.  The TIR date for E-8 candidates must be 
on or before 1 September 2017.  The TIR date for
E-9 candidates must be on or before 1 July 2017.
    c.  High year tenure (HYT) waivers must be approved prior to the board 
convening.  HYT date or approved HYT waivers for the current paygrade must be 
1 July 2020 or later.  Candidates who will be at HYT on 1 July 2020 for the 
next higher paygrade are ineligible for advancement, regardless of any 
approved HYT waiver.
    d.  Commands must revalidate members whose disapproved or cancelled 
retirement authorization is adjudicated prior to the selection board 
convening date by sending an e-mail with the reason for revalidation to the 
Selection Board Eligibility Branch (PERS- 802).  See paragraph 208 of 
reference (a) for Fleet Reserve request impacts to eligibility.
    e.  Security clearance requirements.  See paragraph 203 of reference (a).  
Ratings requiring a security clearance are AC, AE, AG, AO, AT, AWF, AWO, AWR, 
AWS, AWV, AZ, CTI, CTM, CTN, CTR, CTT, EOD, ET, FC, FCA, GM, HT, IC, IS, IT, 
LN, MA, MC, MN, ND, OS, QM, SB, SO, STG and YN, as well as all nuclear and 
submarine ratings.
    f.  Rate specific and competitive group eligibility requirements.  
Candidates must meet special requirements for certain ratings, as outlined in 
paragraph 203 of reference (a).  Commands must verify and submit a message 
formatted e-mail to NETPDC (N321) and PERS-802 requesting invalidation of 
those selection board eligible candidates who no longer meet the rate 
specific and competitive group qualifications by the scheduled board 
convening date.
    g.  Non-nuclear submarine Sailors must be designated as either SS, SU or 
SQ in line with reference (b) as of the board convening date to be eligible.  
Candidates designated as SG or SP are not eligible for advancement.
    h.  While reference (c) required personnel who were selected for
E-8 in FY-17 and FY-18 to successfully graduate from the senior enlisted 
academy (SEA) to be eligible for E-9 board consideration, increased 
throughput requirements made this unachievable.
Therefore, this requirement is waived for E-8s selected in FY-17 and FY-18.  
Reference (c) will be revised with guidance for SEA requirements in future 
selection boards.
