SUBJ/NAVY'S MARITIME SUSTAINMENT STRATEGY: SUSTAINING NAVAL FORCES ACROSS THE 
COMPETITION CONTINUUM.// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the release and distribution of the Navy's 
Maritime Sustainment Strategy (MSS): Sustaining Naval Forces Across the 
Competition Continuum. 
 
2.  The MSS combines and updates the Navy Global Strategy Ashore (September 
2021) and Transforming Naval Logistics for Great Power Competition (January 
2021) into a single authoritative document for a more holistic and integrated 
approach to naval sustainment across the spectrum of conflict. 
 
3.  The MSS further defines outcome-oriented actions to guide the development 
of Sustainment in Depth: a layered, systemic approach to fielding diverse 
sustainment capabilities, necessary capacities, alternate lines of 
communication, and required posture from the industrial base through the 
inter-and intra-theater, to the point of need. 
 
4.  The MSS also addresses the Navy's structural, process, and cultural 
challenges with the intent to close warfighting gaps with the capabilities, 
capacities, and competencies needed to deliver combat effective sustainment 
in a contested environment against a peer adversary. 
 
5.  The MSS can be accessed on SIPRNET via Intelink at the following
