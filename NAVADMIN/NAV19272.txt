RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces revised selective reenlistment bonus (SRB) 
award levels and reenlistment policy for Active Component (AC) and Full-Time 
Support (FTS), updates to the pay for performance pilot (a Sailor 2025 
initiative) and changes to how future SRB award levels will be announced.  
SRB award levels and reenlistment policy listed in this NAVADMIN supersede 
those contained in reference (a).  Additionally, it expands the pay for 
performance pilot program, a Sailor 2025 initiative designed to better reward 
our top Sailors, where eligible Sailors can receive an additional 0.5 
multiple or *kicker* in their SRB multiple if they meet specific criteria 
outlined in paragraph 6.  Finally, all future SRB award level updates, to 
include the addition and closure of skills, will be published on the SRB 
website as opposed to being published via NAVADMIN.  This change is part of a 
concerted effort to increase the agility of the SRB program by publishing 
updates more frequently.  Updates will be posted on MyNavy Portal (MNP) under 
the *SRB* tab at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/pay-and-benefits.  SRB policy 
updates will continue to be announced via NAVADMIN.  SRBs aid in manning the 
Fleet by ensuring retention of qualified talent in critical skills, while the 
pay for performance pilot under Sailor 2025 rewards superior performance.

2.  Increased award levels are effective immediately and decreased levels are 
effective 30 days after the release of this NAVADMIN.
Annual bonus amounts may not exceed $30K per 12 months of additional 
obligated service as stated in reference (b).  Additional bonus calculation 
information can be found via MNP.

3.  Reenlistment requests for the listed SRB award levels will be approved 
based on quota availability.  SRB reenlistment requests for FTS are currently 
not being accepted.  SRB reenlistment requests for AC must be submitted to 
the Community Management Support Branch (BUPERS-328) via Officer Personnel 
Information System (OPINS) or Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System 
(NSIPS) 35 to 120 days in advance of the requested reenlistment date for the 
Sailor.  Eligible Sailors desiring SRB reenlistment are encouraged to work 
with their chain of command as early as possible within their reenlistment 
window to maximize potential for SRB.  For information on the current list of 
SRB eligible ratings/skills based on available quotas and to ensure all 
requirements and timelines are met, visit MNP.  Addendums to the current 
award message are posted on this site and provide notification of skill 
closures and supersede the current NAVADMIN.  For commands with limited 
internet access, command career counselors (CCC) should contact BUPERS-328 
directly for the latest updates.

4.  AC SRB award levels are as follows (Note:  A * indicates a level located 
in other sections of paragraph 4, a - indicates a reduction from previous 
award level and a + indicates an increase from previous award level.  The  
and + are used solely to represent a trend):

    b.  Notes:
        (1) Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) 0000, commonly referred to as 
quad zero, is listed here to establish that Sailors in these ratings/career 
fields can hold any or no NEC and still be qualified for the SRB provided 
they meet all other applicable non- NEC related criteria.
        (2) Subsurface or surface designation does not mean an individual 
must be subsurface or enlisted surface warfare specialist qualified, but it 
indicates the component of the rating in which they can reasonably be 
expected to serve.  Training, qualifications and previous or projected duty 
assignments at-sea will indicate the appropriate rating component.  When 
using the force management system and OPINS to input an SRB precertification 
request, use the rating (with appropriate suffix designation/NEC) as 
specified in this NAVADMIN.  For example, a surface electronics technician 
with no NEC would submit *ET(SW)* on precertification for rating.
        (3) An SRB approval for all CT, IS, IT and ITS ratings will be 
contingent upon the Sailor having a current Single Scope Background 
Investigation (SSBI) or Tier 5 investigation, an active SSBI/Tier 5 or recent 
submission of an SSBI/Tier 5 package.
Commands must verify the Sailor has a current SSBI/Tier 5, active SSBI/Tier 5 
or has submitted an SSBI/Tier 5 package and make a note of this in the 
comments section of the precertification request.
        (4) E-3 to E-6 Sailors only.  Sailors selected for E-7 advancement 
are not eligible for SRB.
        (5) X is used as a placeholder to identify where multiple NECs within 
a rating are eligible for a stated award level.  Sailors in the specified 
rating who hold an NEC that includes the numbers preceding X are eligible for 
SRB.  For example, SO O9XA includes SO O91A and SO O92A, and T1XB includes 
all subsurface Electronics Technician navigation NECs contained in T1XA 
series.
        (6) Reenlistment bonuses for nuclear-trained Sailors.
            (a) Reenlistment compensation for zones 1 through 3 nuclear-
trained Sailors holding a nuclear supervisor NEC shall be provided under the 
Enlisted Supervisor Retention Pay (ESRP) Program in line with policies and 
procedures detailed in reference (c) along with current ESRP multiples.
            (b) SRB entitlement for eligible nuclear-trained Sailors who 
reenlist after applying for an officer program will be held pending selection 
results.  For nuclear-trained Sailors only, the date on which conditional 
release is approved by Nuclear Propulsion Program Manager (OPNAV N133) as 
directed in reference (d), is considered the date of the application to an 
officer program with the exception of Seaman-to-Admiral-21 Nuclear Option 
(STA-21(N)) and Limited Duty Officer (LDO).  For STA-21(N) and LDO, the 
application deadline is considered the suspense date.
        (7) E-4 to E-6 Sailors only.  Sailors selected for E-7 advancement 
are not eligible for SRB.
        (8) E-3 to E-5 Sailors only.  Sailors selected for E-6 advancement 
are not eligible for SRB.
        (9) FCA SRB eligibility contingent upon holding an Aegis Weapon 
System baseline technician or element supervisor NEC.
        (10) CTIs must meet minimum language readiness standard
(L2/R2) for SRB eligibility, unless they possess a valid *Inability to Test* 
waiver from the Navy Language, Regional Expertise and Culture Office (OPNAV 
N13F).  Sailors holding a CTI NEC must be differentiated by the Enlisted 
Manning Code (EMC).  Only Sailors having one of the following NECs and 
assigned in the respective EMC are eligible for SRB:
            (a) NEC:  813A/9RUS, EMC:  B516.
            (b) NEC:  9ARB/9HEB, EMC:  B511.
            (c) NEC:  9CMN/9KOR, EMC:  B512.
        (11) Sailors are eligible for a +0.5 pay for performance SRB kicker 
contingent upon meeting all requirements specified in paragraph 6 below.
        (12) For submarine Sailors only.

5.  Sailors must reenlist within 270-days of their end of active obligated 
service (EAOS), except in the following cases:
    a.  Nuclear-trained Sailors.
    b.  Sailors who must obligate service (OBLISERV) to execute a permanent 
change of station move will be allowed to reenlist early any time within 1 
Calendar Year of the detachment month, but not later than the date of 
detachment from the last intermediate duty station.

6.  The pay for performance program is being piloted as part of the Navys 
overall talent management process improvement effort called Sailor 2025.  
Sailor 2025 is modernizing personnel management and training policies and 
systems to more effectively identify, recruit and train talented people and 
manage the force while improving warfighting readiness.  Eligibility and 
submission requirements are as follows:
    a.  To be eligible, Sailors must:
        (1) Be in the EM, EN, GSM, MM(SW), DC, HT, MR, CSS or AWS rating.
        (2) Have received two Early Promotes (EPs) in block 45 of their three 
most recent periodic evaluations.  Block 8 may indicate REGULAR, FROCKED or 
SELECTED.  Block 10 must be checked for periodic.  No transfer, concurrent or 
special evaluations will apply.  Evaluations are not limited to performance 
documented in the last three years.  The intent is to evaluate the last three 
periodic evaluations, irrespective of how far back in a career that may go, 
so as not to limit eligibility to only those who have served at a single duty 
station for at least three years.
        (3) Have not received Non-Judicial Punishment within the last 3 
years.
        (4) Have not failed any part of the physical fitness assessment in 
the last 3 years.
    b.  Commands must submit a NAVPERS 1306/7, Enlisted Personnel Action 
Request, requesting the SRB kicker, signed copies of the evaluations of the 
Sailor and a printout of their physical readiness information management 
system data to BUPERS-328 once their precertification has been submitted.  
This requirement is only for those who fall under the provisions of this 
paragraph.
    c.  Award ceiling cap values under $100,000 will be raised by $5,000 for 
Sailors eligible for the performance kicker.  For example EN Zone A award 
ceiling will be raised from $30,000 to $35,000 for Sailors who qualify for 
the performance kicker.  Award ceiling caps will not be adjusted over 
$100,000 under these provisions.

7.  SRB Submission Requirements
    a.  Commands are required to submit SRB reenlistment requests to
BUPERS-328 via OPINS or NSIPS 35 to 120 days in advance of the requested 
reenlistment date of the Sailor.  Requests submitted less than 35 days prior 
to the requested reenlistment date will be rejected.  However, commands may 
contact BUPERS-328 for waiver eligibility and procedures.  Sailors must have 
an approved SRB request before reenlisting.  The servicing personnel office 
is responsible for verifying the reenlistment, posting the contract, 
releasing the first payment and verifying the master military pay account.  
Commands shall immediately notify the Military Pay and Compensation Branch 
(OPNAV N130), when a Sailor fails to maintain eligibility in the skill for 
which SRB was paid (e.g., loss of security clearance, medical 
disqualification, loss of eligible NEC, misconduct) or when a Sailor has an 
approved separation with a remaining SRB contract obligation.
    b.  Career Waypoints - Reenlistment (C-WAY-REEN).  Commands are 
authorized to submit SRB reenlistment requests prior to a Sailor receiving a 
C-WAY-REEN quota.  However, the C-WAY-REEN quota request must be submitted.  
In these cases, the SRB request will not be processed until the Sailor has 
received C-WAY-REEN confirmation.
SRB requests without C-WAY-REEN quota approval will be rejected in OPINS to 
keep the command informed of potential SRB approval issues.
Once a Sailor has an approved C-WAY-REEN quota, the command should contact 
BUPERS-328 to clear any rejections.  Failure to submit an SRB reenlistment 
request within the required 35 to 120-day submission window due to awaiting a 
C-WAY-REEN quota does not meet eligibility requirements for a 35-day 
submission waiver.
    c.  Sailors with approved SRB requests who do not reenlist on the date or 
for the term specified in the precertification message must have their 
command contact BUPERS-328 to initiate a reenlistment cancelation to avoid 
placing Sailors in an overpaid status.
    d.  To validate an inoperative extension of enlistment and expedite 
processing of an SRB request, include the following information in the 
remarks paragraph of the request:  term, narrative reason, authority and 
execution date of all inoperative extensions.  Failure to verify extension 
will cause processing delays and may result in rejection of the request or 
approval at a lower amount.
    e.  Sailors must obtain approval for an extension from BUPERS-328 in 
order to minimize the potential for loss of SRB eligibility.

8.  Acceptance of an NEC-specific SRB contract indicates an agreement between 
the Sailor and the Navy to use skills attributed to the NEC during the 
enlistment of the Sailor to meet Fleet readiness requirements.  In subsequent 
tours, a Sailor must be willing to be detailed during the normal projected 
rotation date window to an available billet within the SRB contracted NEC, 
consistent with sea-shore flow requirements.  Lateral conversions must follow 
reference (e), subparagraph 12d.  Lateral conversion requests will normally 
not be processed more than 9 months before the EAOS.  Conversions to a rate 
with a lower award level normally will not be approved.  Personnel in a 
closed-loop NEC can reenlist by the NEC only.

9.  Reference (e), paragraph 16f, provides OBLISERV to Train (OTT) guidance.  
Requests are to be submitted to BUPERS-328 extension desk via e-mail.  A copy 
of the authorization message should be retained by the Sailor until the SRB 
reenlistment on graduation day from the course of instruction.  Use code 1CC 
for OTT SRB request in OPINS or NSIPS.  Additionally, OBLISERV requirements 
for schools are provided in reference (f).  OBLISERV will be determined based 
on the course length, as provided in paragraph 3b of reference (f). Paragraph 
3c(1) no longer applies.

10.  In keeping with Department of Defense (DoD) policy, Sailors who accepted 
an enlistment bonus for extended enlistment (EBEE), as reflected on their 
Enlisted Bonus Payment Checklist (NAVCRUIT 1133/52, Enlistment Guarantees, 
New Accession Training Program Enlistment Guarantee or Professional 
Apprenticeship Career Track Program Enlistment Guarantees), are not 
authorized to use this inoperative extension time in the SRB calculation.  
Sailors who have inoperative extension time through a 5-year obligation or 6-
year obligation program may continue to have up to 24 months of inoperative 
extension time count towards the SRB calculation provided the reenlistment 
results in a new EAOS that is at least 24 months day-for-day past the current 
extended EAOS.  This calculation is performed automatically by BUPERS-328.  
Local commands are not authorized to cancel or change extensions for the 
purpose of immediate SRB reenlistments.  Commands must verify and annotate on 
the precertification request whether any inoperative extension time noted is 
part of an EBEE contract.

11.  Repayment policy is governed by section 373 of Title 37, U.S. Code, DoD 
Financial Management Regulation (FMR) Chapter 2, Volume 7A and reference (e), 
which collectively determines when repayment of the unearned portion of a 
bonus is required or not required but left to Secretarial discretion or 
prohibited.  Section 373 of Title 37, U.S. Code, requires repayment with 
certain exceptions.  As a general rule, repayment of any unearned portion of 
a bonus will be sought.

12.  Sailors who have reenlisted and have not received their SRB payment or 
have questions concerning the taxation of their SRB and annual installments 
should work with their Command Pay and Personnel Administrator to contact the 
servicing pay office or personnel support detachment to resolve those issues.  
SRB tax information is also discussed in DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 44, 
table 44-1, rule

5.  The point of contact for a Sailor with questions regarding the SRB 
program or any information on their on-line personnel account is their CCC.  
For questions regarding current award levels, check the SRB website via MNP 
at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/pay-and-benefits, then click on the *SRB* 
tab.  For technical questions or clarification, CCCs, not individual Sailors, 
are encouraged to contact BUPERS-328 at (901) 874-3215 or (901) 874-3915/DSN 
882 or via e-mail at mill_incen_pays(at)navy.mil or contact the SRB Help Desk 
at (901) 874-2526/DSN 882.

13.  We will continue to assess retention behavior and adjust SRB award 
levels accordingly.

14.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
