RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN SUPERSEDES REF A AND ESTABLISHES BONUS ELIGIBILITY FOR 
DESIGNATED MILITARY SKILLS AND ANNOUNCES REVISED RETENTION BONUS AWARD LEVELS 
FOR DRILLING SELECTED RESERVE (SELRES) ENLISTED PERSONNEL BY RATE/RATING, NEC 
AND ZONE.  WHERE REF B AND  THIS NAVADMIN DIFFER, THIS NAVADMIN TAKES 
PRECEDENCE.

2.  EFFECTIVE DATE OF AWARD LEVELS.  INCREASED AWARD LEVELS ARE EFFECTIVE 
IMMEDIATELY AND DECREASED AWARD LEVELS ARE EFFECTIVE 30  DAYS AFTER RELEASE OF 
THIS MESSAGE.

3.  TO ENSURE OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS NOW AND IN THE FUTURE, THE  NAVY MUST 
RETAIN THE MOST TALENTED SAILORS OF THE RESERVE COMPONENT (RC).
 AN
EFFECTIVE RETENTION PLAN REQUIRES FLEXIBLE TOOLS TO ENSURE RETENTION  OF THE 
CORRECT NUMBER OF SAILORS WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS TO OPTIMIZE OUR WARFIGHTING 
CAPABILITY.  THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CLARIFY THE BONUS PROGRAM.
    A.  GENERAL.
        (1) ALL BONUSES GOVERNED BY THIS NAVADMIN WILL BE PAID IN 
INSTALLMENTS.  THE INITIAL PAYMENT WILL EQUAL 50 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL BONUS 
AMOUNT, AND SUBSEQUENT PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE IN EQUAL  ANNIVERSARY PAYMENTS.  
ELIGIBILITY FOR CONTINUED ANNIVERSARY PAYMENTS IS  CONTINGENT UPON MEMBER 
MAINTAINING SATISFACTORY PARTICIPATION IN THE DESIGNATED RATE/RATING FOR EACH 
YEAR OF THEIR BONUS CONTRACT.  SAILORS ARE  HIGHLY ENCOURAGED TO REENLIST SIX 
YEARS TO MAXIMIZE THEIR BONUS OPPORTUNITY.
        (2) A SAILOR'S CURRENT END OF OBLIGATED SERVICE (EOS) DATE  MUST FALL 
WITHIN FY 2012.  SEE PARAGRAPH 5A FOR REENLISTMENT POLICY  REGARDING MEMBERS 
WHO ARE IN ZONE A ELIGIBILITY.
        (3) SAILORS MUST HAVE LESS THAN 16 YEARS TOTAL MILITARY  SERVICE AS 
CALCULATED FROM THEIR PAY ENTRY BASE DATE (PEBD) ON THE DATE OF  THE 
QUALIFYING REENLISTMENT.
        (4) EXTENSIONS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO GAIN ELIGIBILITY FOR REENLISTMENT 
BONUSES.
        (5) NAVY RESERVE SAILORS CURRENTLY SERVING UNDER A  CONTRACTUAL 
OBLIGATION FOR A PRIOR SERVICE AFFILIATION OR ENLISTMENT BONUS MUST  BE WITHIN 
90 DAYS OF COMPLETION OF THAT OBLIGATION PRIOR TO REENLISTING  TO QUALIFY FOR 
A REENLISTMENT BONUS.  FAILURE TO MEET THIS REQUIREMENT  WILL RESULT IN EARLY 
TERMINATION OF THE PRIOR BONUS AND RECOUPMENT OF THE UNEARNED PORTION OF THAT 
BONUS.
        (6) PER REF B, SAILORS MAY ONLY RECEIVE ONE 6-YEAR OR TWO CONSECUTIVE 
3-YEAR BONUSES FOR REENLISTMENT (EXCLUSIVE OF  PRIOR-SERVICE AFFILIATION 
BONUS) IN A CAREER.
    B.  RATING CONVERSION.  NAVY RESERVE SAILORS CURRENTLY SERVING IN THE 
SELECTED RESERVE WHO ARE APPROVED FOR CHANGE OF RATE TO A BONUS ELIGIBLE 
RATING LISTED IN PARA 6 MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR A REENLISTMENT  BONUS AS FOLLOWS:
        (1) CHANGE OF RATE APPROVED VIA DIRECT CONVERSION.
            (A) SAILORS APPROVED FOR A CHANGE OF RATE WHO ARE WITHIN
 12
MONTHS OF THEIR EOS, AND WHOSE EOS CONFORMS TO THE DATES IN PARAGRAPH 2, MAY 
REENLIST IMMEDIATELY UPON CHANGE OF RATE APPROVAL TO GAIN ENTITLEMENT FOR A 
REENLISTMENT BONUS.
            (B) THE INITIAL BONUS PAYMENT SHALL BE PROCESSED AND PAID TO 
SAILORS IN THIS CATEGORY AFTER THEIR REENLISTMENT AND IMMEDIATELY  UPON 
RECEIPT OF THEIR BONUS APPLICATION BY CNRFC N11.
        (2) CHANGE OF RATING APPROVED VIA SUCCESSFUL COMPETITION OR CONCURRENT 
CHANGE OF RATING.
            (A) SAILORS WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE RATE-CONVERSION 
REQUIREMENTS, ARE WITHIN 12 MONTHS OF THEIR CURRENT  EOS, AND WHOSE EOS 
CONFORMS TO THE DATES IN PARAGRAPH 2, MAY REENLIST FOR  A REENLISTMENT BONUS.
            (B) SAILORS WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE CHANGE OF RATE 
REQUIREMENTS, BUT HAVE MORE THAN 12 MONTHS REMAINING ON THEIR  CURRENT EOS, 
MAY REQUEST EARLY REENLISTMENT FROM PERS-812 TO QUALIFY FOR A QQQQ 
REENLISTMENT BONUS.  BOTH THE EARLY REENLISTMENT REQUEST AND THE  CHANGE OF 
RATE REQUEST MUST BE SUBMITTED AT THE SAME TIME.
            (C) THE INITIAL BONUS PAYMENT SHALL BE PROCESSED AND PAID TO 
SAILORS IN THIS CATEGORY ONLY AFTER COMPLETING ALL REQUIREMENTS TO PERMANENTLY 
EFFECT THE CHANGE OF RATE.
    C.  ALL OTHER BASIC ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA CONTAINED IN REF B  REMAIN IN 
EFFECT.
