RMKS/1. THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE FY09 ENERGY CONSERVATION AWARDS  
IAW REF A.  ALTHOUGH THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR OVER A  
DECADE, IT TAKES ON INCREASED SIGNIFICANCE THIS YEAR AS THE NAVY

MEETING THE SECNAV GOAL OF 50% ALTERNATE FUELS BY 2020  REQUIRES US AS 
A NAVY TO CONSUME FUEL AT A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RATE  THAN IN THE PAST.  
ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS THE LEAST COSTLY WAY TO MAKE  THE GREATEST 
DIFFERENCE IN FUEL REDUCTION AND BEHAVIORIAL CHANGES  ARE ESSENTIAL TO 
THE NAVY'S ABILITY TO REACH THESE GOALS.  THE  OBJECTIVE OF THE ENERGY 
CONSERVATION AWARDS PROGRAM IS TO PROMOTE  EXCELLENCE IN ENERGY 
CONSERVATION AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE  DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY.  
RECOGNITION WILL BE GIVEN FOR OUTSTANDING  LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY 
MANAGEMENT, INNOVATIONS IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF  ENERGY EFFICIENCY,

HOUSEKEEPING, AND MAINTENANCE.  THIS PROGRAM REINFORCES  NAVYS 
LEADERSHIP AS AN OUTSTANDING STEWARD OF THE ENVIRONMENT.
