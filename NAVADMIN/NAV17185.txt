RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits applications for the Academic Year
(AY18-19) Pol-Mil Masters (PMM) Program.  The PMM Program provides junior 
Navy officers a graduate education in strategy and politico- military affairs 
at leading civilian universities throughout the United States.  Ultimately 
the PMM program is a key component of the Navy Strategic Enterprise, creating 
through education a naval strategist cadre to be utilized in subsequent 
strategy and policy- related billets.
    a.  Eligibility.  Active duty O3-O5 Unrestricted Line (URL) and 
Restricted Line (RL) 1710, 1810, 1820, and 1830-designated officers are

the start of the academic year.  Preference will be given to junior officers 
(03-04).  Full Time Support (FTS) officers are not eligible. Officers who

education program are not eligible; however, those officers who earned a 
degree through the Tuition Assistance Program or Service war college retain 
their eligibility for PMM.

selected for the one-year PMM program.  The two-year PMM and Arthur S. Moreau

requirements.  When completing the university applications, prospective

candidate.  PMM candidates should verify the university's work experience 
requirements and are advised to apply to at least three schools.
