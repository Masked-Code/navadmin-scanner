SUBJ/NAVY RESERVE BIRTHDAY MESSAGE// 
RMKS/1.  HAPPY 94TH BIRTHDAY TO OUR NAVY RESERVE.  AS WE MARK THIS 
OCCASION ON 3 MARCH, I EXTEND MY SINCERE APPRECIATION TO ALL 
SAILORS WHO ARE SERVING OUR NATION AT HOME AND ABROAD, AND TO OUR 
COMMUNITIES, EMPLOYERS, FAMILIES, AND FRIENDS WHO PROVIDE THE 
SUPPORT WHICH ENABLES US TO SERVE.
2.  SINCE THOMAS JEFFERSON FIRST PROPOSED A NAVAL MILITIA IN 1805, 
THROUGH FORMAL CONGRESSIONAL ACTION TO ESTABLISH A FEDERAL NAVAL 
RESERVE IN 1915, TO CURRENT OPERATIONAL AUGMENTATION REQUIREMENTS, 
IN PEACE AND WAR, NAVY RESERVISTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO 
OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE IN EVERY MAJOR CONFLICT.  TODAY, 4,900 RESERVE 
COMPONENT SAILORS ARE FILLING KEY NAVY COMBAT AND COMBAT SUPPORT 
REQUIREMENTS IN THE CENTRAL COMMAND AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY, 
INCLUDING MISSIONS IN DETAINEE OPS, EOD, NAVAL CONSTRUCTION, 
ELECTRONIC WARFARE, MEDICAL, INTELLIGENCE, AVIATION, AND CUSTOMS 
INSPECTIONS.
3.  WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE NAVY AND NAVY 
RESERVE DURING THE PAST 94 YEARS.  THE RELEASE OF THE NAVY 
RESERVE'S NEW STRATEGIC PLAN THIS WEEK DEMONSTRATES ITS ONGOING 
COMMITMENT TO BE "READY NOW, ANYTIME, ANYWHERE" AS A FULL PARTNER 
IN NAVY'S TOTAL FORCE.  IN DOING SO, OUR RESERVE COMPONENT 
CONTINUES TO PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN PROJECTING NAVAL POWER TO SUPPORT 
OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS.  THE RESPONSIVENESS, CONTINUED READINESS, 
AND DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT TO SERVICE OF OUR RESERVISTS ARE 
CRITICAL ELEMENTS ENABLING OUR NAVY TO ACCOMPLISH MANY OF ITS 
MISSIONS.  FROM YOUR SUPPORT OF HOMELAND DEFENSE TO DEPLOYING 
FORWARD FOR OPERATIONS ENDURING FREEDOM AND IRAQI FREEDOM, I THANK 
EACH OF YOU, YOUR FAMILIES, AND SUPPORTING EMPLOYERS FOR CONTINUED 
COMMITMENT TO SERVICE AND INDIVIDUAL READINESS.  
4.  I AM PROUD OF YOU AND WHAT YOU CONTINUE TO DO FOR OUR 
COMMUNITIES, NAVY, AND NATION.
5.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
