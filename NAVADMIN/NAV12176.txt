SUBJ/FAMILYGRAM 03-12 - SAILOR AND FAMILY RESILIENCE//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN DISCUSSES TOOLS TO REGAIN BALANCE IN THE PRESENCE OF 
STRESS.  NAVY'S 21ST CENTURY SAILOR AND MARINE INITIATIVE ENCOMPASSES FIVE 
FOCUS AREAS DESIGNED TO BUILD RESILIENCE AND WAR FIGHTING CAPABILITY IN OUR 
FORCE:  READINESS, SAFETY, PHYSICAL FITNESS, INCLUSION, AND CONTINUUM OF 
SERVICE.  IN THE NAVY, RESILIENCE IS DEFINED AS THE "CAPACITY TO WITHSTAND, 
RECOVER, GROW, AND ADAPT IN THE FACE OF STRESSORS AND CHANGING DEMANDS." 

2.  THE FOLLOWING FOUR TOOLS PROVIDE TANGIBLE CHOICES TO IMPROVE YOUR 
RESILIENCE:
    A.  MAINTAIN YOUR BODY FOR ITS UNIQUE OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE. 
        (1) EAT DELIBERATELY.  WE DECIDE WHAT WE CONSUME AND HOW WE TAKE CARE 
OF OUR BODIES.  BALANCED AND NUTRITIOUS MEALS WITH MODERATE PORTIONS HELP FUEL 
THE BODY.  MAKE HEALTHY CHOICES.
        (2) GET ENOUGH SLEEP.  SLEEP IS CRITICAL TO PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL 
WELL-BEING.  FIND WAYS TO "WIND DOWN" AND PREPARE YOUR BODY FOR REST. 
        (3) MAKE EXERCISE A HABIT.  REGULAR EXERCISE HELPS YOU PHYSICALLY AND 
IMPROVES YOUR MOOD.  IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN EXERCISING, CHECK WITH YOUR 
PHYSICIAN BEFORE STARTING AN EXERCISE PROGRAM.
    B.  DEVELOP POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS.  
        (1) NURTURE AT LEAST ONE TRUSTED FRIEND.  A STRONG POSITIVE 
RELATIONSHIP CAN HELP ACHIEVE PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS.  A FRIEND CAN 
PROVIDE SUPPORT, INFLUENCE PERSONAL GROWTH, AND PROVIDE A SOURCE OF STRENGTH 
DURING DIFFICULT TIMES.  
        (2) CONNECT BY SOCIAL MEDIA.  IT IS A METHOD TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH 
FRIENDS WHO LIVE AROUND THE WORLD; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR FACE-
TO-FACE COMMUNICATION.  REMEMBER 7 PERCENT OF COMMUNICATION IS COMPRISED OF 
THE ACTUAL WORDS WE USE WHICH MEANS 93 PERCENT IS BODY LANGUAGE AND THE TONE 
OF OUR WORDS WHICH IS NOT CAPTURED IN SOCIAL MEDIA.
    C.  MANAGE YOUR FINANCES - DON'T LET THEM MANAGE YOU. DEVELOP AND FOLLOW A 
BUDGET.  FINANCES CAN BE A MAJOR FAMILY STRESSOR.  NAVADMIN 377/11 CONTAINS 
FINANCIAL PLANNING TIPS. 
    D.  CONSIDER YOUR SPIRITUAL WELLNESS.  A TALK WITH A CHAPLAIN, MENTOR OR 
TRUSTED ADVISOR CAN BE A GREAT OUTLET FOR STRESS REDUCTION AND RESILIENCY.  
VISIT HTTP://CHAPLAINCARE.NAVY.MIL/ FOR SUPPORT.

3.  STRESS IS A FACT OF LIFE.  IT IS NORMAL AND IT CAN HELP YOU EXCEL AND 
SUCCEED, BUT THERE IS A POINT WHEN STRESS MAY IMPACT YOUR ABILITY TO COPE.  
INJURIES MAY OCCUR AFTER PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO STRESSFUL SITUATIONS.  WHEN IT 
BECOMES OVERBEARING TO YOUR WELL-BEING, ASK FOR ASSISTANCE.  ASKING FOR HELP 
IS A SIGN OF STRENGTH AND A COMMITMENT TO YOURSELF TO PERFORM AT YOUR OPTIMAL 
LEVEL.  FRIENDS, FAMILY, AND CO-WORKERS PROVIDE SUPPORT, BUT THERE ARE TIMES 
WHEN SOMEONE WITH MORE EXPERIENCE, KNOWLEDGE, AND SKILL IS BETTER SUITED TO 
FACILITATE REGAINING OUR BALANCE, ADAPTING TO LIFE EVENTS AND CHANGES, AND 
LEARNING FROM OUR EXPERIENCES.  THE OPERATIONAL STRESS CONTROL CONTINUUM IS A 
KEY ASSET FOR DETERMINING WHAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT IS NEEDED.  INFORMATION ON THE 
STRESS CONTINUUM AND STRESS ZONES IS AVAILABLE AT 
HTTP://NAVYNAVSTRESS.COM/CATEGORY/STRESS-ZONES/.
