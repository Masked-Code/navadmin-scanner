RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN cancels reference (a) and announces the renewal and 
restructuring of the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Critical Skills Accession 
Bonus (CSAB) for chief warrant officers (CWO) in designators 7151 and 7171.  
Accessing NSW CWOs is a priority for the Navy.  The NSW CSAB is part of the 
Navy's overarching effort to size, shape, and stabilize the NSW force. 
Special Warfare Operators or Special Warfare Boat Operators selected for CWO 
that meet the eligibility criteria in this NAVADMIN may apply.

2.  Per reference (b), section 324 authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to 
offer officer accession bonus payments to commissioned officers with critical 
skills as designated by the Secretary of Defense.  The Deputy Chief of Naval 
Operations for Manpower, Personnel, Training, and Education (OPNAV (N1)) has 
been delegated authority to administer the NSW CSAB program.  The NSW Officer 
Community Manager (OCM) will act as program manager and exercise management 
control of the NSW CSAB paid to members as an accession incentive.

3.  CWO selectees may apply for a bonus level of $45,000.00 for accepting a 
commission and serving on active duty in designators 7151 and 7171 for a 
four-year obligated service period after commissioning.  All applicants for 
this bonus program must submit an application through their commanding 
officer to the NSW OCM for approval, processing, and tracking.  The 
eligibility criteria stated in this NAVADMIN can be changed at any time by 
the program manager if a bonus reduction is warranted based on the needs of 
the NSW community.

4.  Program Eligibility:
    a.  Applicants must be active-duty service members selected by a CWO 
selection board for commissioning in designators 7151 or 7171.
    b.  Selectees who accept an appointment to CWO, and who are currently on 
a NSW Critical Skills Retention Bonus contract, will be ineligible to receive 
or apply for a NSW CSAB.
    c.  Applicants must have their commanding officers endorsement.

5.  Qualified applicants will receive a $45,000.00 bonus, and will incur a 4 
year active-duty service obligation from date of commission.

6.  Program Execution:
    a.  Members should submit their request letter for the NSW CSAB to the 
program manager 30 days prior to entering into a NSW CSAB contract via their 
chain of command.
    b.  Upon acceptance of a member's agreement, the amount of the bonus 
becomes fixed and the member incurs a firm service obligation.
    c.  Service members will receive the bonus in a lump sum payment.

7.  Application Process:
    a.  Eligible NSW CWO selectees may apply for NSW CSAB via their 
commanding officer.  Applications can be sent via e-mail to 
seal_ocm(at)navy.mil.  Encrypted e-mail is preferred.  Submit applications by

    b.  The following documents are required:

and
        (2) Commanding officer's endorsement letter.

8.  Repayment policy is governed by reference (b), section 303(a) and 
reference (c).  A member of the uniformed services who enters into a written 
agreement with specified service conditions for receipt of a bonus is 
entitled to the full amount of the bonus if the member fulfills the 
conditions of that written agreement.  If the member fails to fulfill the 
service conditions specified in the written agreement for the pay, then the 
pay may be terminated and the member may be required to repay an amount equal 
to the unearned portion of the pay.

9.  Point of contact is NSW OCM who can be reached at (703) 604-5064/664 or
