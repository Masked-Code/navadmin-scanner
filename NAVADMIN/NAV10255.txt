RMKS/1.  INFLUENZA OR "FLU" HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT 
NAVY FORCE READINESS AND MISSIONS.  IN THE UNITED STATES, INFLUENZA 
RESULTS IN OVER 25 MILLION REPORTED CASES, OVER 150,000 
HOSPITALIZATIONS DUE TO SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS, AND OVER 30,000 DEATHS 
ANNUALLY.

2.  PER REFS A AND B, THE FOLLOWING INFLUENZA VACCINATION AND REPORTING 
POLICY IS ESTABLISHED:
A.  INFLUENZA PREVENTION.  VACCINATION IS THE PRIMARY METHOD TO REDUCE 
RISK OF INFLUENZA BY ENHANCING FORCE IMMUNITY.  MAINTAINING A CLEAN 
WORK ENVIRONMENT, GOOD HYGIENE PRACTICES, AND MANAGING WORKFORCE 
EXPOSURE (I.E., SOCIAL DISTANCING, TELE-WORKING, SICK LEAVE, ETC.) ARE 
SOME SIMPLE METHODS TO REDUCE RISK OF INFLUENZA SPREAD.
B.  INFLUENZA VACCINE.  THE SEASONAL (COMBINED OR TRIVALENT) INFLUENZA 
VACCINE CONTAINS THREE INACTIVE VIRUS COMPONENTS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE 
OF THE MOST PREVALENT STRAINS FOR THE UPCOMING SEASON.  THE 2009 H1N1 
PANDEMIC STRAIN IS INCORPORATED AS ONE OF THE THREE 2010-2011 SEASONAL 
INFLUENZA VACCINE COMPONENTS.  NEW INFLUENZA STRAINS WITH THE POTENTIAL 
TO BECOME PANDEMIC HAVE NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR 2010-2011 BUT THE 
POSSIBILITY REMAINS THAT A NEW VIRUS STRAIN COULD EMERGE, BECOME A 
PANDEMIC AND REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE.  THE ARMED FORCES 
HEALTH SURVEILLANCE CENTER WILL CLOSELY MONITOR THE EMERGENCE OF 
POTENTIAL NEW VIRUS STRAINS.
C.  INFLUENZA VACCINE PRIORITY.  NAVY COORDINATES FORCE INFLUENZA 
VACCINE PRIORITY WITH THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR HEALTH 
AFFAIRS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PANDEMIC INFLUENZA TASK FORCE.  
DOD'S TOP THREE VACCINE PRIORITIES ARE (1) CENTCOM (INCLUDES NAVY SHIPS 
AND OPERATIONAL FORCES), (2) KOREA (INCLUDES NAVY SHIPS AND OPERATIONAL 
FORCES), AND (3) ALL OTHER NAVY SHIPS AND OPERATIONAL FORCES.  NAVY 
SHIPS AND OPERATIONAL FORCES WILL RECEIVE FIRST 50 PERCENT OF AVAILABLE 
VACCINE.
D.  INFLUENZA VACCINE REQUISITIONS.  THE NAVY ON-LINE VACCINE 
INFORMATION AND LOGISTICS SYSTEM (VIALS) WAS ESTABLISHED IN MARCH 2010 
AS THE REQUISITION SYSTEM FOR SEASONAL AND NEW INFLUENZA VACCINES.  
NAVY VIALS REPLACES THE PREVIOUS PROCESS THROUGH WHICH COMMANDS 
INDIVIDUALLY REQUISITIONED VACCINE VIA MILSTRIP.  NAVY VIALS SIMPLIFIES 
VACCINE REQUISITIONS AND ENABLES COMMANDS TO TRACK VACCINE ORDERS ON-
LINE FROM REQUISITION TO RECEIPT.
E.  INFLUENZA VACCINE ORDERING.  NAVY INFLUENZA VACCINE IS NOW BATCH-
ORDERED BY NAVAL MEDICAL LOGISTICS COMMAND (NAVMEDLOGCOM) FROM THE 
DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY (DLA) USING COMMAND REQUIREMENTS IN NAVY 
VIALS.  NAVY INFLUENZA VACCINE IS NOW CENTRALLY FUNDED VICE INDIVIDUAL 
NAVY COMMAND FUNDED.
F.  INFLUENZA VACCINE DISTRIBUTION.  NAVY HAS DEVELOPED A SEVERE 
PANDEMIC VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLAN TO DECREASE THE SHIPPING TIME OF 
VACCINE FROM DEFENSE SUPPLY CENTER PHILADELPHIA (DSCP) TO RECEIVING 
NAVY COMMANDS AND MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITIES (MTFS).  NAVY COMMANDS 
WILL TRACK VACCINE SHIPMENTS VIA VIALS, COORDINATE WITH NAVMEDLOGCOM 
AND THEIR SERVICING MTF TO DETERMINE WHEN INFLUENZA VACCINE WILL BE 
AVAILABLE, AND CONDUCT IMMEDIATE COMMAND-WIDE VACCINATIONS UPON VACCINE 
ARRIVAL.  THE NAVY'S VACCINATION GOAL IS 100 PERCENT BY 01 DECEMBER 
2010.
G.  INFLUENZA VACCINATION COMPLIANCE.
(1) NAVY MILITARY PERSONNEL.  PER REFS A AND B, SEASONAL INFLUENZA 
VACCINATION IS MANDATORY FOR ALL DOD UNIFORMED PERSONNEL WHO ARE NOT 
MEDICALLY OR ADMINISTRATIVELY EXEMPT.  ALL NAVY ACTIVE AND RESERVE 
COMPONENT (AC/RC) PERSONNEL, NOT MEDICALLY OR ADMINISTRATIVELY EXEMPT 
MUST, AS SOON AS OPERATIONALLY FEASIBLE, RECEIVE DOD MANDATORY 
INFLUENZA VACCINE(S).  ANY REFUSAL TO RECEIVE THE INFLUENZA VACCINE MAY 
CONSTITUTE A FAILURE TO OBEY A LAWFUL ORDER AND MAY BE PUNISHABLE UNDER 
THE UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE (UCMJ) AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE 
ACTION FOR FAILURE TO OBEY A LAWFUL ORDER (UCMJ, ARTICLE 92).  COMMANDS 
WILL IDENTIFY NAVY EMERGENCY ESSENTIAL MILITARY PERSONNEL AND PROVIDE 
THIS INFORMATION TO THEIR SERVICING MTF FOR INFLUENZA VACCINATION 
PRIORITY IAW REFS C AND D. PRIOR TO RECEIVING THE INFLUENZA VACCINE, 
NAVY AC/RC PERSONNEL SHALL HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO 
DISCUSS OBJECTIONS OR CONCERNS WITH INFLUENZA VACCINATION.  COMMANDS 
SHOULD CONSULT WITH THE SERVICING STAFF JUDGE ADVOCATE FOR ADDITIONAL 
GUIDANCE ON INFLUENZA VACCINATION NON-COMPLIANCE.
(2) NAVY EMERGENCY ESSENTIAL (EE) CIVILIAN PERSONNEL.  COMMANDS WILL 
IDENTIFY NAVY EE CIVILIAN PERSONNEL AND PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO 
THEIR SERVICING MTF FOR VACCINATION PRIORITY.  INFLUENZA VACCINATION, 
INCLUDING THE SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE, IS MANDATORY FOR NAVY EE 
CIVILIANS WHO HAVE INFLUENZA VACCINATION WRITTEN INTO THEIR CONTRACT OR 
POSITION DESCRIPTION AS A CONDITION OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT AND WHO ARE NOT 
MEDICALLY OR ADMINISTRATIVELY EXEMPT.  NAVY EE CIVILIAN PERSONNEL WHO 
DO NOT HAVE INFLUENZA VACCINATION WRITTEN INTO THEIR CONTRACT OR 
POSITION DESCRIPTION AS A CONDITION OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT ARE HIGHLY 
ENCOURAGED BUT NOT REQUIRED TO RECEIVE INFLUENZA VACCINATION(S).  
CIVILIAN IMMUNIZATION REFUSALS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED WITH THE CIVILIAN 
PERSONNEL OFFICE AND SERVICING STAFF JUDGE ADVOCATE.
(3) NAVY NON-EE CIVILIAN PERSONNEL.  NAVY NON-EE CIVILIAN PERSONNEL ARE 
HIGHLY ENCOURAGED BUT NOT REQUIRED TO RECEIVE INFLUENZA VACCINATION(S).
H.  INFLUENZA VACCINATION REPORTING.
(1) OPERATIONAL VACCINATION REPORTING.  COMMANDING OFFICER 
REPRESENTATIVES (CORS) WILL REPORT INFLUENZA VACCINATIONS VIA THE NAVY 
FAMILY ACCOUNTABILITY AND ASSESSMENT SYSTEM (NFAAS).  NFAAS HAS BEEN 
UPGRADED TO REPORT AND TRACK INDIVIDUAL VACCINATIONS FOR ALL MILITARY 
PERSONNEL AND FOR EE CIVILIAN PERSONNEL WHEN VACCINATION IS A CONDITION 
OF EMPLOYMENT.  THE NFAAS COR WILL DESIGNATE COMMAND EE CIVILIANS UNDER 
THE COMMAND TAB AND "EMER ESSENTIAL PERS" MENU SELECTION.  THIS IS A 
CHANGE FROM THE 2009 PANDEMIC WEEKLY REPORTING WHICH PREVIOUSLY 
REQUIRED CORS TO SURVEY COMMAND PERSONNEL AND REPORT AGGREGATE COMMAND 
INFLUENZA VACCINATION STATUS EACH WEEK.  THE WEEKLY NFAAS COR AGGREGATE 
INFLUENZA VACCINATION STATUS REPORT IS NO LONGER REQUIRED.  NFAAS NOW 
ENABLES CORS TO INDICATE VACCINATION COMPLETION FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL AND 
THIS VACCINATION STATUS REMAINS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL DURING THE 
INFLUENZA SEASON AND THROUGHOUT PERSONNEL TRANSFERS OR TRANSIENT 
ASSIGNMENTS.  NFAAS CORS MUST VALIDATE THEIR COMMAND NFAAS INFORMATION 
BY 1 SEPTEMBER 2010.  OPERATIONAL VACCINATION REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS 
ARE AVAILABLE ON THE NFAAS WEBSITE: HTTPS://NAVYFAMILY.NAVY.MIL
(2) MEDICAL VACCINATION REPORTING.  COMMAND MEDICAL REPRESENTATIVES 
WILL REPORT VACCINATIONS THROUGH MEDICAL SYSTEMS: AHLTA, SAMS, MRRS OR 
DEERS.
I.  NAVY'S GOALS AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
(1) THE 2010 FLU SEASON WILL BE EXECUTED AS IF NAVY IS IN A PANDEMIC 
EVENT.  NAVY UNITS HAVE 24 HOURS TO DOCUMENT AND REPORT VACCINATION 
STATUS FROM TIME OF VACCINE RECEIPT TO VACCINATION ADMINISTERED.  UNIT 
SITREPS ARE REQUIRED IF VACCINE SHIPMENTS TO COMMANDS OR COMMAND 
VACCINATIONS ARE DELAYED.  COMMANDS WILL COORDINATE WITH MTFS TO ALIGN 
COMMAND WIDE-VACCINATIONS WITH VACCINE ARRIVAL AND IMMEDIATELY REPORT 
VACCINATIONS IN NFAAS.
(2) NAVY'S GOAL IS 100 PERCENT NAVY TOTAL FORCE (ACTIVE, RESERVE AND EE 
CIVILIAN) VACCINATION BY 1 DEC 2010 AND 100 PERCENT TOTAL NAVY FAMILY 
(INCLUDES DEPENDENTS, BENEFICIARIES, DON CIVILIANS) VACCINE ACCESS. THE 
FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES AND MILESTONES WILL BE MONITORED.
(3) NAVY'S PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.

3.  IMPROVEMENTS TO NAVY'S INFLUENZA VACCINATION REQUISITION, ORDERING, 
DISTRIBUTION, COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING PROCEDURES ARE FOCUSED ON 
ENSURING NAVY FORCE READINESS AND MISSION ACCOMPLISHMENT BY VACCINATING 
THE FORCE AS QUICKLY AS VACCINE IS AVAILABLE.  IT IS CRUCIAL THAT
