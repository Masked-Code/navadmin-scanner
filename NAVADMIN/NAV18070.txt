RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces suspension of Active and Reserve Component 
Intelligence (INTEL) Limited Duty Officer (LDO) designator 683X accessions 
due to the overlap in INTEL LDO and Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) skill sets.  
Formal disestablishment of the 683X designator will take place after natural 
attrition of current inventory.

2.  According to references (a) and (b), Navy will suspend INTEL LDO 
accessions beginning with the fiscal year (FY) 2020 (calendar year
(CY) 2019) In-Service Procurement Board.  The final selection of eligible 
candidates for INTEL LDO will occur with the FY-19 (CY-18) In-Service 
Procurement Board in line with references (c) and (d).
Active Component INTEL LDOs are highly encouraged to complete INTEL
(1830) requirements and submit Without Board Action requests, consistent with 
references (a) and (e).  Reserve Component INTEL LDOs are highly encouraged 
to complete INTEL (1835) requirements and change designator  references (a) 
and (f).  All 683X billets will be converted to either 783X or 183X in 
coordination with billet stakeholders.
