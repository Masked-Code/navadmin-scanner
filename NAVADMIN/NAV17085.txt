SUBJ/SERVICEMEMBERS GROUP LIFE INSURANCE ONLINE ENROLLMENT SYSTEM//

RMKS/1.  The Department of the Navy, in collaboration with the Veteran 
Affairs, Department of Defense, Defense Finance and Accounting Service 
(DFAS), Defense Manpower Data Center and the other uniformed services, 
announces the launch of the Servicemembers Group Life Insurance (SGLI) Online 
Enrollment System (SOES).  SOES is a web-based system available through My 
Navy Portal that allows Sailors to validate or change SGLI or Family SGLI 
(FSGLI) coverage amounts and beneficiaries quickly and easily without using 
paper forms.  SOES is available 24 hours a day and provides detailed guidance 
to Sailors that enables them to make informed decisions on their life 
insurance policy elections.

2.  SOES replaces the SGLI Election and Certificate form (SGLV-8286) and 
Family Coverage Election form (SGLV-8286A) as the authoritative record of 
life insurance coverage.  SOES automatically creates the Sailors record by 
using the SGLI/FSGLI coverage amount and effective date stored in the Defense 
Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System.  In order for the SOES record to be 
complete and considered authoritative, Sailors must log into the SOES 
application by April 2018 to provide beneficiary name(s), share(s) of 
proceeds, and to certify the record with a digital signature.  Sailors who 
have declined coverage previously and want to continue with no coverage have 
no required action.  Forms SGLV-8286/8286A will continue to be the 
authoritative record until the above actions are complete.  Additionally, the 
SGLV-8286/8286A forms will continue to be valid if used in extenuating 
circumstances where there is no
= means for Sailors to access SOES.

3.  Commands shall ensure Sailors complete their SOES record by April 2018.  
Sailors access SOES by navigating to My Navy Portal at
https://my.navy.mil and selecting the milConnect tab, and once logged into 
milConnect, selecting the "SOES" option under the "Benefits" tab.  Access 
requires a Common Access Card, DFAS (myPay) account, or DS LOGON account.

4.  For more information, take the online training course available at 
http://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/training/SOES/SOES.htm.
