SUBJ/SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS (SRB) POLICY CHANGE// 
REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/30JAN2007// REF/B/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON DC 281554Z AUG 
08// AMPN/REF A IS SRB PROGRAM INSTRUCTION (OPNAVINST 1160.8A), REF B 
IS NAVADMIN 240/08, FY09 SRB AWARD PLAN// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES CHANGES TO POLICIES IN REF A, PARA 12 
AND REF B GOVERNING THE EARLY REENLISTMENT WINDOW FOR SRB ELIGIBLE 
SAILORS.  
2.  EARLY REENLISTMENT WINDOW.  EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, SAILORS CAN 
REENLIST FOR SRB NO MORE THAN 90 DAYS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THEIR 
ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE OR EAOS (EXCLUDES ANY NON-OPERATIVE 
EXTENSION(S) OF ENLISTMENT AND WILL BE REFERRED TO THROUGHOUT THIS 
NAVADMIN AS "HARD EAOS") UNLESS THEY FALL UNDER THE CURRENT EXCEPTIONS 
IN PARA 12 OF REF A OR THEY ARE REENLISTING FOR ONE OF THE 
RATINGS/NECS/SKILLS LISTED BELOW IN PARA 4.  ANY MODIFICATIONS TO THE 
LIST IN PARA 4, IF NEEDED, WILL BE INCLUDED IN FUTURE SRB AWARD PLAN 
NAVADMINS.  THIS POLICY CHANGE INSTITUTES A ROLLING 90-DAY WINDOW TO 
REENLIST EARLY FOR SRB WITHIN THE FISCAL YEAR.  THIS ROLLING WINDOW 
WILL PROGRESS THROUGH THE FISCAL YEAR BUT WILL NOT CROSS THE FISCAL 
YEAR BOUNDARY.  THIS IS A CHANGE FROM THE CURRENT POLICY IN PARA 12 OF 
REF A AND OF REF B UNDER WHICH A SAILOR IS ELIGIBLE TO REENLIST EARLY 
FOR SRB ANY TIME WITHIN THE SAME FISCAL YEAR AS THEIR HARD EAOS.  ALL 
SRB REENLISTMENT REQUESTS ARE REQUIRED  TO BE SUBMITTED VIA OPINS 35-
120 DAYS PRIOR TO THE REQUESTED REENLISTMENT DATE.  SRB REQUESTS 
SUBMITTED LESS THAN 35 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE REQUESTED DATE OF 
REENLISTMENT MAY BE REJECTED.  
3.  WHEN A NEW SRB AWARD PLAN IS ANNOUNCED, THE 90-DAY ROLLING WINDOW 
REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR ALL SRB-ELIGIBLE SAILORS WITH AWARD LEVELS THAT 
REMAIN THE SAME OR INCREASE.  A SAILOR WHOSE SRB AWARD LEVEL DECREASES 
OR IS REMOVED IS ELIGIBLE TO REENLIST IN THE FIRST 30 DAYS FOLLOWING 
RELEASE OF A NEW SRB AWARD PLAN ONLY IF THEIR HARD EAOS IS WITHIN 90 
DAYS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE MESSAGE.  ON THE DAY AFTER THAT 
PERIOD ENDS, A NEW 90-DAY ROLLING PERIOD BEGINS.  AS WITH THE 
EXCEPTIONS MENTIONED IN PARA 2 ABOVE, EXCEPTIONS TO THIS CHANGE IN THE 
SRB EARLY REENLISTMENT WINDOW POLICY ARE IN REF A, PARA 12 AND PARA 4 
BELOW.
4.  THE FOLLOWING NECS IN ZONES A, B AND C ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE 90-
DAY ROLLING WINDOW OF ELIGIBILITY AND ARE AUTHORIZED TO REENLIST 
ANYTIME WITHIN THE FISCAL YEAR:
RATING      NEC

ADDITIONALLY, SAILORS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR COMBAT ZONE TAX EXCLUSION 
(CZTE) OR SERVING IN A QUALIFIED HAZARDOUS DUTY AREA 
(HDA) AND HAVE A HARD EAOS THAT FALLS IN THE MOST CURRENT FISCAL YEAR 
ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE 90-DAY ROLLING WINDOW OF ELIGIBILITY AND ARE 
AUTHORIZED TO REENLIST ANYTIME WITHIN THE FISCAL YEAR.  THESE SAILORS 
ALONG WITH COMMAND CAREER COUNSELORS MUST ANNOTATE IN THE REMARKS 
SECTION OF THE PRECERTIFICATION REQUEST WHETHER THEY ARE CURRENTLY CZTE 
ELIGIBLE OR SERVING IN A QUALIFIED HDA.  A CONDITION OF APPROVAL OF 
THIS PRECERTIFICATION REQUEST IS THAT THE SAILOR'S REENLISTMENT OCCURS 
IN A MONTH DURING WHICH CZTE OR HDA QUALIFICATION APPLIES.  COMMANDS 
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR VALIDATING THEIR SAILOR'S CZTE OR HDA QUALIFICATION 
AT THE TIME OF REENLISTMENT.    
5.  SRB REENLISTMENT REQUESTS ALREADY RECEIVED BY PERS-811 THROUGH 
OPINS AS OF THE DATE OF RELEASE OF THIS NAVADMIN WILL BE PROCESSED 
UNDER THE PREVIOUS POLICIES IN REF A AND NAVADMIN 240/08, THE CURRENT 
SRB AWARD PLAN.  ALL NEW SRB REENLISTMENT REQUESTS RECEIVED BY PERS-811 
AFTER THE RELEASE OF THIS NAVADMIN WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE POLICY 
CHANGES OF THIS NAVADMIN.  ALL OTHER SRB PROGRAM POLICIES AND 
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES IN REFS A AND B AND THE DEFENSE JOINT 
MILITARY PAY SYSTEM (DJMS) PROCEDURES TRAINING GUIDE REMAIN IN EFFECT.
