RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces revised Selective Reenlistment 
Bonus (SRB) award levels and reenlistment policy for active 
component and Full-Time Support (FTS).  This NAVADMIN supersedes 
reference (a).  Rating modernization efforts have no impact on this 
program and traditional rating titles are used throughout this 
NAVADMIN. 
 
2.  Increased award levels are effective immediately and decreased 
levels are effective 30 days after the release of this NAVADMIN. 
Policy changes to the reenlistment eligibility window listed in 
paragraph 7 are effective 30 days after the release of this 
NAVADMIN. 
 
3.  Reenlistment requests for the following SRB award levels will be 
approved based on quota availability.  SRB reenlistment requests 
must be submitted to Enlisted Career Administration/Enlisted Boards 
(PERS-81) via Officer Personnel Information System (OPINS) or Navy 
Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) 35 to 120 days in 
advance of the requested reenlistment date for the Sailor.  Eligible 
Sailors desiring SRB reenlistment are encouraged to work with their 
chain of command as early as possible within their reenlistment 
window to maximize potential for SRB.  Enlisted Active Program 
Incentives (PERS-813) maintains the current list of SRB eligible 
ratings/skills based on available quotas at the following website: 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers- 
npc/career/enlistedcareeradmin/pages/srb.aspx.  Addendums to the 
current award message posted on this site provide notification of 
skill closures and supersede the current NAVADMIN.  For those 
commands with limited internet access, command career counselors 
(CCC) should contact PERS-813 directly for the latest updates.

    b.  Notes 
        (1) Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) 0000 (commonly 
referred to as quad zero) is listed here to establish that Sailors 
in these ratings/career fields can hold any or no NEC and still be 
qualified for the SRB provided they meet all other applicable non- 
NEC related criteria. 
        (2) Subsurface or surface designation does not mean an 
individual must be subsurface or enlisted surface warfare specialist 
qualified, but it indicates the component of the rating in which 
they can reasonably be expected to serve.  Training, qualifications, 
and previous or projected duty assignments at sea will indicate the 
appropriate rating component.  When using the force management 
system and the OPINS to input a SRB precertification request, use 
the rating (with appropriate suffix designation/NEC) as specified in 
this NAVADMIN.  For example, a surface electronics technician with 
no NEC would submit 'ET(SW)' on precertification for rating. 
        (3) A SRB approval for all CT, IS, IT, and ITS ratings will 
be contingent upon the Service Member having a current single scope 
background investigation (SSBI), an active SSBI or recent submission 
of a SSBI package.  Commands must verify the Service Member has a 
current SSBI, active SSBI, or has submitted a SSBI package and make 
note of this in the comments section of the precertification 
request. 
        (4) E-3 to E-6 personnel only. 
        (5) X is used as a placeholder to identify where multiple 
NECs within a rating are eligible for a stated award level.  Service 
Members in the specified rating that hold a NEC that includes the 
numbers preceding X or XX are eligible for SRB.  For example, SO 
539XA includes SO 5391 and SO 5392 or 14XX includes all subsurface 
electronics technician navigation NECs beginning with 14. 
        (6) Letters appearing with a NEC are only for administrative 
use. 
        (7) Reenlistment bonuses for nuclear trained personnel: 
            (a) Reenlistment compensation for zones 1 through 3 
nuclear trained personnel holding a nuclear supervisor NEC shall be 
provided under the Enlisted Supervisor Retention Pay (ESRP) Program 
in line with policies and procedures detailed in reference (b) along 
with current ESRP multiples. 
            (b) SRB entitlement for eligible nuclear-trained Service 
Members who reenlist after applying for an officer program will be 
held pending selection results.  For nuclear trained personnel only, 
the date on which conditional release is approved by Nuclear 
Propulsion Program Manager (N133) as directed in reference (c) is 
considered the date of the application to an officer program. 
        (8) E-4 to E-6 personnel only. 
 
6.  Reenlistment Opportunity.  Sailors must reenlist within 90 days 
and in the same fiscal year as their End of Active Obligated Service 
(OBLISERV (EAOS)), except in the following cases: 
    a.  Nuclear trained Sailors. 
    b.  Sailors eligible for combat zone tax exclusion (CZTE) are 
authorized to reenlist anytime within the same fiscal year as their 
EAOS.  These Sailors, along with CCC must annotate in the remarks 
section of the precertification request whether they are currently 
CZTE eligible or serving in a qualified hazardous duty area.  A 
condition of approval of their precertification request is that the 
reenlistment of the Sailor occurs in a month during which CZTE 
qualification applies. 
    c.  Sailors who received an Early Promote in block 45 of their 
most recent regular periodic evaluation will be allowed to reenlist 
early any time within the fiscal year of their EAOS.  No transfer, 
concurrent, or special evaluations will apply.  Sailors advanced 
within the 12 months prior to their EAOS will be allowed to 
substitute the last regular periodic evaluation in their previous 
pay grade.  Personnel must e-mail a signed copy of the evaluation to 
PERS-81 once their precertification has been submitted.  This 
requirement is only for those that fall under the provisions of this 
paragraph. 
 
7.  SRB Submission Requirements 
    a.  Commands are required to submit SRB reenlistment requests to 
PERS-81 via OPINS or NSIPS 35 to 120 days in advance of the Sailors 
requested reenlistment date.  Requests submitted less than 35 days 
prior to the requested reenlistment date will be rejected.  However, 
commands may contact PERS-81 for waiver eligibility and procedures. 
Sailors must have an approved SRB request before reenlisting.  The 
servicing personnel office is responsible for verifying the 
reenlistment, posting the contract, releasing the first payment, and 
verifying the master military pay account. 
    b.  Career Waypoints - Reenlistment (C-WAY-REEN):  Commands are 
authorized to submit SRB reenlistment requests prior to a Service 
Member receiving a C-WAY-REEN quota.  However, the C-WAY-REEN quota 
request must be submitted.  In these cases, the SRB request will not 
be processed until the Service Member has received C-WAY-REEN 
confirmation.  SRB requests without C-WAY-REEN approval will be 
rejected in OPINS to keep the command informed of potential SRB 
approval issues.  Once a Service Member has an approved C-WAY-REEN 
quota, the command should contact PERS-81 to clear any rejections. 
Failure to submit a SRB reenlistment request within the required 120 
to 35 day submission window due to awaiting a C-WAY-REEN quota does 
not meet eligibility requirements for a 35 day submission waiver. 
    c.  Sailors with approved SRB requests who do not reenlist on 
the date or for the term specified in the precertification message 
must have their command contact PERS-81 to initiate a reenlistment 
cancellation to avoid placing Sailors in an overpaid status. 
    d.  To validate an inoperative extension of enlistment and 
expedite processing of a SRB request, include the following 
information in the remarks paragraph of the request:  term, 
narrative reason, authority, and execution date of all inoperative 
extensions.  Failure to verify extension will cause processing 
delays and may result in rejection of the request or an approval at 
a lower amount. 
    e.  Sailors must obtain an approval for extension from PERS-81 
in order to minimize the potential for loss of SRB eligibility. 
    f.  For FTS SRB reenlistment requests use one of the below 
listed type codes: 
        (1) CODE 1RR, Immediate Reenlistment for FTS SRB. 
        (2) CODE 1RB, Broken Service Reenlistment for FTS SRB. 
        (3) CODE 1RC, OBLISERV to Train and Reenlist for FTS SRB. 
 
8.  NEC-Specific SRB and Lateral Conversions.  Acceptance of a NEC- 
specific SRB contract indicates an agreement between the Sailor and 
the Navy to use skills attributed to the NEC during the enlistment 
of the Sailor to meet fleet readiness requirements.  In subsequent 
tours, a Sailor must be willing to be detailed during the normal 
projected rotation date window to an available billet within the SRB 
contracted NEC, consistent with sea-shore flow requirements. 
Lateral conversions must follow reference (d), paragraph 12d. 
Lateral conversion requests will normally not be processed more than 
nine months before the EAOS.  Conversions to a rate with a lower 
award level normally will not be approved.  Personnel in a closed- 
loop NEC can reenlist by the NEC only. 
 
9.  OBLISERV to Train (OTT).  Reference (d), paragraph 12e, provides 
OTT guidance.  Requests are to be submitted to PERS-81 extension 
desk via e-mail.  A copy of the authorization message should be 
retained by the Sailor until the SRB reenlistment on graduation day 
from the course of instruction.  Use code 1CC (1RC for FTS) for OTT 
SRB request in OPINS or NSIPS. 
 
10.  Inoperative Extensions Policy.  In keeping with Department of 
Defense (DoD) policy, personnel who accepted an enlistment bonus for 
extended enlistment (EBEE), as reflected on their Enlisted Bonus 
Payment Checklist (NAVCRUIT 1133/52 (Enlistment Guarantees, New 
Accession Training Program Enlistment Guarantee or Professional 
Apprenticeship Career Track Program Enlistment Guarantees)), are not 
authorized to use this inoperative extension time in the SRB 
calculation.  Sailors who have inoperative extension time through a 
five-year obligation or six-year obligation program, or as 
authorized in Control of Conditional Short Term Extensions (NAVADMIN 
007/09), may continue to have up to 24 months of inoperative 
extension time count towards the SRB calculation provided the 
reenlistment results in a new EAOS that is at least 24 months day- 
for-day past the current extended EAOS.  This calculation is 
performed automatically by PERS-81.  Local commands are not 
authorized to cancel or change extensions for the purpose of 
immediate SRB reenlistments.  Commands must verify and annotate on 
the precertification request whether any inoperative extension time 
noted is part of an EBEE contract. 
 
11.  Repayment.  Repayment policy is governed by section 373 of 
Title 37 of U.S. Code, Chapter 2 Volume 7A of the DoD Financial 
Management Regulation (FMR), and reference (d), which collectively 
determines when repayment of the unearned portion of a bonus is 
required or not required but left to Secretarial discretion, or 
prohibited.  Section 373 of Title 37 of U.S. Code requires repayment 
with certain exceptions.  As a general rule, repayment of any 
unearned portion of a bonus will be sought. 
 
12.  To ensure all requirements and timelines are met, visit the 
following SRB page of the NPC website: 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers- 
npc/career/payandbenefits/N130/pages/N130D.aspx. 
 
13.  Point of contact for a Sailor who has reenlisted and has not 
received their SRB payment, or has questions concerning the taxation 
of their SRB and annual installments, is the servicing pay office or 
personnel support detachment of the Sailor.  SRB tax information is 
also discussed in DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 44, table 44-1, 
rule 7.  The point of contact for a Sailor with questions regarding 
the SRB program or any information on their on-line personnel 
account is their CCC.  For technical questions or clarification, 
CCCs, not individual Sailors, are encouraged to contact MCPO James 
Lucky, PERS-813, at (901) 874-3215/DSN 882, fax at (901) 874- 
2623/DSN 882, or via e-mail at james.lucky1(at)navy.mil, Mr. 
Francisco Palomo at (901) 874-3915/DSN 882, or via e-mail at 
francisco.palomo(at)navy.mil, or the SRB Help Desk at 
(901) 874-2526/DSN 882. 
 
14.  We will continue to assess retention behavior and adjust SRB 
award levels accordingly. 
 
15.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or 
canceled, whichever comes first.
