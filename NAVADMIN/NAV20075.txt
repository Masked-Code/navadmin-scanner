SUBJ/MAINTAINING AND PROTECTING THE NAVY ACCESSIONS SUPPLY CHAIN (CORRECTED 
COPY)//

REF/A/MEMO/ASN (M&RA)/18MAR20//

NARR/REF A IS ASN (M&RA) MEMO ON MAINTAINING AND PROTECTING DEPARTMENT OF THE 
NAVY ACCESSIONS SUPPLY CHAIN// POC/RADM JEFFREY JABLON/OPNAV N13/703-604- 
5040/JEFFREY.JABLON(AT)NAVY.MIL//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN implements reference (a) and directs the 
implementation of measures to maintain and protect the Navy Accessions Supply 
Chain, from recruiting, through initial military training and follow-on 
training, to a new Service Members first duty station (i.e., Street to 
Fleet).

2.  It is imperative we protect the Navy Accessions Supply Chain (officer and 
enlisted) in view of the impact COVID-19 is having nationwide.  As we 
implement measures directed in reference (a), we must balance risk to mission 
and risk to force.

3.  The Department of the Navy considers the Accessions Supply Chain (i.e., 
recruiting, initial military training, follow-on training, through to 
ultimate duty station) as mission essential.

4.  The Commander, Naval Education and Training Command (NETC) is directed to 
implement a 14-day Restriction of Movement (ROM) for new Service Members 
(officer and enlisted) arriving for initial military training.  Shipping 
plans to initial military training may be modified to mitigate risk (i.e., 
based on berthing capacity or Health Protection Condition (HPCON) of specific 
geographic regions).

5.  In addition to the actions above, Commander, NETC is directed to 
implement measures at initial military training sites to both protect the 
staff from COVID-19 infection, as well as mitigate the external threat of 
COVID-19 infection from outside sources.

6.  Finally, Commander, NETC is directed to implement measures to protect the 
remainder of the Accessions Supply Chain after recruit and officer graduation 
from initial military training.  These measures should include provisions for 
movement of new Service Members from completion of initial military training 
to intermediate training stops which will minimize potential threats of 
COVID-19 infection.  Commander, NETC, will evaluate the process for moving 
new Service Members from their final intermediate training stop to ultimate 
duty stations and make risk mitigation recommendations to the Chief of Naval 
Personnel.

7.  To keep the Accessions Supply Chain functioning, we will accept some 
level of risk.  Therefore, it is essential for ultimate duty station 
commanding officers and officers in charge to ensure they have measures in 
place to safely onboard new Service Members to operational units.
