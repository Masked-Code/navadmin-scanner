2.  THE LATERAL TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION BOARD IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE.  
EACH RECORD THAT IS PRESENTED TO THE BOARD IS CAREFULLY REVIEWED AND THE 
BEST AND MOST FULLY QUALIFIED ARE CHOSEN.

3.  QUOTA CONSTRAINTS FOR JUNIOR YEAR GROUPS (04 THROUGH 08) WERE 
ESPECIALLY TIGHT THUS THE DEMAND SIGNAL FAR EXCEEDED THE SUPPLY POOL.
MANY QUALITY APPLICANTS WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE BOARD, BUT COULD NOT BE 
SELECTED DUE TO QUOTA CONSTRAINTS OF EITHER OUTGOING COMMUNITY OR 
GAINING COMMUNITY.  THEREFORE, NOT BEING SELECTED FOR THIS BOARD IS NOT 
A REASON TO FEEL THAT YOU HAVE NO FUTURE CHANCE.  YOU SHOULD APPLY AGAIN 
(AND AGAIN AS REQUIRED), ALL THE WHILE SUSTAINING SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE 
AND BOLSTERING YOUR RECORD FOR YOUR DESIRED COMMUNITY. WHAT MAKES YOUR 
RECORD STANDOUT IS MOTIVATION TOWARDS YOUR GAINING COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS 
CONTINUED PROMOTABILITY.

4.  AS ALWAYS, COMPETITION FOR REDESIGNATION WAS KEEN AND EVERY 
COMMUNITY HAD A POOL OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES.  ELIGIBLE OFFICERS 
NOT INITIALLY SELECTED, AND WHO DID NOT SPECIFICALLY REQUEST NOT TO BE 
REVIEWED BY COMMUNITIES OTHER THAN THEIR FIRST OR SECOND CHOICE, WERE 
SUBSEQUENTLY REVIEWED BY ALL OTHER COMMUNITIES.  THOSE OFFICERS 
TENTATIVELY SELECTED FOR COMMUNITIES NOT INITIALLY REQUESTED WILL BE 
NOTIFIED VIA OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE AND OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
REDESIGNATE.

5.  THE PROCESS, WHILE NEVER PERFECT, IS FAIR AND THOROUGH.  BOARD 
MEMBERS ARE FOCUSED ON THEIR TASK:  PICKING THE RIGHT CANDIDATE WHO IS 
FULLY AND BEST QUALIFIED FROM THE AVAILABLE APPLICANTS.  EACH RECORD 
RECEIVES A DETAILED REVIEW AND THERE IS THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE 
DISCUSSIONS ON EACH APPLICANT.

6.  THIS MESSAGE IS NOT AUTHORITY TO DELIVER CHANGE OF DESIGNATOR 
LETTERS TO THE SELECTEE.
    A.  OFFICERS WHO ARE PROMOTION SELECTEES SHOULD CONTACT THEIR 
CURRENT DETAILER TO DISCUSS REDESIGNATION TIMING.  COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-
803), UPON NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) THAT THE SELECTEE HAS 
BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO THEIR NEW COMMUNITY, WILL FORWARD A REDESIGNATION 
LETTER TO THE SELECTEE OR APPOINTMENT ACCEPTANCE AND OATH OF OFFICE 
(NAVPERS 1000/4), AS APPLICABLE.
    B.  OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT PROMOTION SELECTEES AND WHO ARE NOT
    UNDER
ORDERS CAN EXPECT ASSIGNMENT TO A NEW BILLET APPROPRIATE TO THEIR NEW 
DESIGNATION WHEN NOTIFIED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4).
    C.  IF A MEMBER IS CURRENTLY UNDER ORDERS AND TRANSFERS PRIOR TO
NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4), MEMBER MUST EXECUTE ORDERS UNDER 
CURRENT DESIGNATOR AND MUST COMPLETE 12 MONTHS AT THE NEW ASSIGNMENT, 
UNLESS A SHORTER TOUR IS PRESCRIBED (TOURS IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR WILL BE 
WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE GAINING COMMUNITY), PRIOR TO REDESIGNATION.

7.  THE FOLLOWING ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE ABOVE:
    A.  SURFACE WARFARE (11XX) OFFICERS WHO ARE UNDER ORDERS TO 
DEPARTMENT HEAD SCHOOL MAY NOT LATERALLY TRANSFER UNTIL COMPLETION OF 
INITIAL DEPARTMENT HEAD TOUR.
    B.  AVIATION OFFICERS (131X AND 132X) SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED TO
LATERAL TRANSFER UNTIL COMPLETION OF ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE OBLIGATION, 
EXPIRATION OF AVIATION CAREER CONTINUATION PAY CONTRACT, OR PLANNED 
ROTATION DATE, WHICHEVER IS LATER.
    C.  SELECTEES FOR 1510 WHO ARE PRESENTLY DESIGNATED 131X OR 132X
WHO HAVE NOT COMPLETED A SECOND SEA TOUR OR AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD 
TOUR MAY BE DELAYED IN, ASSIGNMENT TO 1510 BILLETS MAY BE DELAYED UNTIL 
THE COMPLETION OF APPLICABLE SECOND SEA AND/OR AVIATION DEPARTMENT HEAD 
TOUR, AS DETERMINED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-43).

8.  COMMANDING OFFICER SHALL:
    A.  ENSURE OFFICERS SELECTED FOR PROMOTION WITHIN THEIR CURRENT 
COMMUNITY DO NOT ACCEPT REDESIGNATION BEFORE THEIR PROMOTION DATE.
    B.  NOTIFY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-803) WITHIN 30 DAYS OF RELEASE OF 
THIS MESSAGE OF SELECTEES WHO DO NOT DESIRE TO ACCEPT TRANSFER/ 
REDESIGNATION.

9.  THE NEXT TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION BOARD WILL BE HELD ON 13 JUNE 2011.
APPLICATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1 APRIL 2011.  PREVIOUS APPLICATIONS 
ARE NOT RETAINED; NON-SELECTEES FROM PREVIOUS BOARDS MUST SUBMIT A NEW 
APPLICATION FOR CONSIDERATION.  A FUTURE NAVADMIN WILL STIPULATE ALL OF 
THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION PROCEDURES IAW REF A THRU 
D.
