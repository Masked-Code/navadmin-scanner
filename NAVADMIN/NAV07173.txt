2.  AS ALWAYS, COMPETITION FOR REDESIGNATION WAS KEEN, AND EVERY COMMUNITY 
HAD A POOL OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES TO SELECT FROM. THE BOARD NOTED THE 
FOLLOWING LESSONS LEARNED FROM THESE DELIBERATIONS:
    A.  PERFORMANCE, PERFORMANCE, PERFORMANCE.  STRONG UNCLAS
SUBJ: JUNE 2007 TRANSFER AND REDESIGNATION SELECTION BOARD RESULTS 
PERFORMANCE AND RELEVANT EXPERIENCE WERE THE MOST COMMON FACTORS IN MEMBERS 
SELECTED.
    B.  INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION (IA) EXPERIENCE WAS AN IMPORTANT 
CONSIDERATION IN DETERMINING THE OVERALL STRENGTH OF THE MEMBER S RECORD.
    C.  FIRST ENDORSEMENTS FROM THE APPLICANTS CURRENT REPORTING SENIOR WERE 
IMPORTANT.  PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WERE COMMENTS SPECIFICALLY SUPPORTING THE 
REQUEST REGARDING POSITIVE FUTURE POTENTIAL.
    D.  SEEK SPONSORSHIP.  GAINING COMMUNITY ENDORSEMENT AND EVIDENCE OF A 
CANDIDATE S PROACTIVE EFFORT IN SEEKING GAINING COMMUNITY MENTORSHIP WERE 
CONSIDERED HIGHLY FAVORABLE ELEMENTS IN MAKING A RECORD MORE COMPETITIVE AND 
SOMETIMES ACTED TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN TWO, OTHERWISE IDENTICAL RECORDS.
    E.  COMMUNICATE YOUR SELECTABILITY.  FAMILIARITY AND UNDERSTANDING THE 
COMMUNITY YOU DESIRE TO REDESIGNATE TO SHOULD ASSIST YOUR PREPARATION IN 
DEVELOPING A LOGICAL, RELEVANT RECORD FOR BOARD EVALUATION.  BEYOND THE 
MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS, YOUR PACKAGE SHOULD EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE EXPERIENCE, 
SKILLS, EDUCATION, AND SENIOR SPONSORSHIP.  HAVING A MEMBER OF YOUR GAINING 
COMMUNITY REVIEW YOUR PACKAGE WOULD BE HIGHLY BENEFICIAL.  ADDITIONALLY, 
RELEVANT EDUCATION COURSES, CERTIFICATIONS, AND COMMUNITY RELATED EXPERIENCE 
WERE VIEWED EXTREMELY FAVORABLY IN DETERMINING THE OVERALL STRENGTH OF 
APPLICANTS RECORDS.
    F.  KEEP TRYING.  REDESIGNATION OPPORTUNITY IS DRIVEN BY QUOTAS THAT 
BECOME AVAILABLE FROM BOARD TO BOARD.  THAT DEMAND SIGNAL IS DYNAMIC AND 
CHANGES WITH EACH BOARD.  THESE QUOTAS ARE NOT ONLY INTO THE COMMUNITY YOU 
DESIRE, BUT THOSE ALLOWED FROM YOUR CURRENT COMMUNITY.  IF YOU ARE NOT 
SELECTED, RE-APPLY AND KEEP WORKING TO IMPROVE YOUR RECORD IN THOSE SKILLS 
RELEVANT TO YOUR DESIRED REDESIGNATION COMMUNITY.  ALSO, REVIEW THE BOARD 
PRECEPT TO DETERMINE IF NON-SELECTION WAS DUE TO YEAR GROUP QUOTA 
RESTRICTIONS.  REFER TO THE SELECTION BOARD WEBSITE AT
