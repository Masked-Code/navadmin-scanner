RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the suspension of the Navy Physical 
Readiness Program Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA) for Cycle 2, 2020 and 
updates policy guidance pertaining to future Physical Readiness Test (PRT) 
modalities provided in reference (a).  The COVID-19 situation requires that 
we continue to minimize risk to personnel, therefore all personnel will be 
EXCUSED from participation in Navy PFA Cycle 2, 2020.

2.  Suspension includes both the official Body Composition Assessment (BCA) 
and PRT components of the PFA.
    a.  The Physical Readiness Program office will update Physical Readiness 
Information Management System (PRIMS) to reflect EXCUSED for Navy PFA Cycle 
2, 2020 (only) for both BCA and PRT.  Command Fitness Leaders (CFL) and 
Assistant CFLs (ACFL) are directed not to make any official PFA entries in 
PRIMS for the official Navy PFA Cycle 2, 2020.
    b.  All Navy commands are to continue the suspension of all organized or 
group physical training (PT) (i.e. Command, Department or Division PT and the 
Fitness Enhancement Program (FEP)), until further notice.
    c.  Exceptions to paragraph 2.a and 2.b:
        (1) Accessions missions (e.g., recruit training) and the appropriate 
Echelon II commander with authority to delegate to the first flag officer in 
the chain of command may grant unit mission training requirements.
        (2) Regaining advancement/retention eligibility.  As outlined in 
reference (b), Sailors can regain eligibility by passing an unofficial (mock) 
PFA within Navy PFA Cycle 2, 2020.

3.  Guidelines for administering a mock PFA for Navy PFA Cycle 2, 2020.  Mock 
PFA will be conducted when COVID-19 conditions permit following local area 
and installation guidance (e.g. Stage 2).  The mock PFA must be conducted as 
outlined in reference (c) with the following exceptions:
    a.  Consist of no more than 10 people, to include CFL and ACFL.
    b.  Ensure proper medical screening.
    c.  Conduct BCA with the following modifications to follow social 
distancing practices:
        (1) CFL/ACFLs:
            (a) Perform COVID-19 symptom screening and temperature check 
immediately prior to the BCA.
            (b) Limit close contact to less than 15 minutes per person.
            (c) Must wear a mask at all times during the BCA.
            (d) Must wear disposable gloves during all circumference 
measurements.  Disposable gloves must be replaced after each circumference 
measurement for each member.
            (e) Disinfect scales, height measurement apparatus, pens and tape 
measures between each use.
            (f) Designate only one person as recorder for each BCA session.
        (2) Service Member:
            (a) Must wear a mask at all times during the BCA.
            (b) Self-reporting.  If feeling ill during BCA, Service Member 
must report to medical department or local Medical Treatment Facility for 
further medical evaluation.
    d.  Conduct mock PRT with the following modifications to follow social 
distancing practices:
        (1) To mitigate COVID-19 concerns, curl-ups are prohibited for the 
mock PFA.
        (2) Personnel will only be tested on push-ups and the 1.5 mile run or 
approved alternate cardio (i.e. stationary bike, swim,
treadmill) where available.  Protective face masks are prohibited for members 
while performing the mock PRT.
        (3) Self-reporting.  If Service Member response to pre- physical 
activity questions requires medical assistance, member must report to medical 
and be medically cleared before participating in mock PRT.
        (4) Disinfect floor-mats and all alternate cardio equipment between 
each use.
        (5) Designate only one person as recorder for each PRT session.
    e.  All mock PFAs must be entered in PRIMS under the FEP tab of the 
Service Member to document their BCA and PRT results within 30 days and prior 
to regaining advancement/retention.

4.  Although the Navy PFA Cycle 2, 2020 has been excused, Sailors are 
reminded to make good choices for a healthy diet and are to continue a level 
of fitness to maintain Navy physical fitness standards.  Commander Navy 
Installations Command Morale, Welfare and Recreation Fitness Program has put 
together a Navy Operational Fitness and Fueling System (NOFFS) 5-week 
conditioning plan, located at https://www.navyfitness.org/fitness/5-week-
training-plan to assist Sailors in maintaining Navy physical fitness 
standards.
Individuals and commands are highly encouraged to use the NOFFS 5- week 
conditioning plan to improve operational readiness and reduce the severity of 
injury.

5.  Future changes to PRT Modalities.  The previously announced changes to 
the PRT modalities (replacement of curl-ups with plank and addition of rower 
alternative cardio option) will be implemented for cycle 1, 2021.  Sailors 
will be provided additional guidance at a later time.  Sailors will be given 
ample time to practice the plank before it is officially counted for a PRT 
score (i.e., no plank failures will be counted on initial implementation)

6.  Questions and concerns regarding these policy changes may be referred to 
the Physical Readiness Program at PRIMS(at)navy.mil or (901) 874-2210.
