INOPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  FAILURE TO VERIFY EXTENSIONS WILL CAUSE PROCESSING 
DELAYS AND MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF THE REQUEST OR AN APPROVAL AT A LOWER 
AMOUNT.
    E.  SAILORS MUST OBTAIN AN APPROVAL FOR EXTENSION FROM NAVPERSCOM (PERS-
811) IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF SRB ELIGIBILITY.

8.  THE FOLLOWING GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED ON NEC-SPECIFIC SRB AND LATERAL 
CONVERSIONS.  ACCEPTANCE OF A NEC-SPECIFIC SRB CONTRACT INDICATES AN AGREEMENT 
BETWEEN THE SAILOR AND THE NAVY TO UTILIZE SKILLS ATTRIBUTED TO THE NEC DURING 
THE SAILOR'S ENLISTMENT TO MEET FLEET READINESS REQUIREMENTS.  IN SUBSEQUENT 
TOURS, A SAILOR MUST BE WILLING TO BE DETAILED DURING THE NORMAL PROJECTED 
ROTATION DATE WINDOW TO AN AVAILABLE BILLET WITHIN THE SRB CONTRACTED NEC, 
CONSISTENT WITH SEA-SHORE FLOW REQUIREMENTS.  LATERAL CONVERSIONS MUST FOLLOW 
REF B, PARA 12.D.  LATERAL
