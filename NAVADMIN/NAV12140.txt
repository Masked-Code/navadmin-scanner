RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN OUTLINES APPLICATION PROCEDURES FOR ELIGIBLE SAILORS 
NOT SELECTED FOR RETENTION BY THE ENLISTED RETENTION BOARD
(ERB) WHO DESIRE EARLY RETIREMENT UNDER THE TEMPORARY EARLY RETIREMENT 
AUTHORITY (TERA), AS ANNOUNCED BY REF A.  FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS MESSAGE, THE 
TERM "RETIREMENT" IS SYNONYMOUS WITH "TRANSFER TO THE FLEET RESERVE."  ALL 
ELIGIBLE ERB MEMBERS DESIRING CONSIDERATION FOR EARLY RETIREMENT UNDER TERA 
MUST VOLUNTARILY APPLY USING THE PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN THIS NAVADMIN.  THE 
NEEDS OF THE NAVY WILL BE THE PARAMOUNT CONSIDERATION IN APPROVING INDIVIDUAL 
REQUESTS FOR RETIREMENT FOR SAILORS WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO QUALIFY 
FOR A 20-YEAR RETIREMENT.  ADMINISTRATIVE SEPARATIONS FOR INVOLUNTARY REASONS, 
AS DEFINED IN REF B, MAY TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER TERA REQUESTS.

2.  ELIGIBILITY:  ONLY ENLISTED MEMBERS NOT SELECTED FOR RETENTION BY THE FY-
12 ERB WHO WILL HAVE COMPLETED AT LEAST 15 YEARS OF ACTIVE SERVICE AS OF 1 
SEPTEMBER 2012, ARE ELIGIBLE FOR TERA IN FY-12.
ACTIVE SERVICE IS CALCULATED FROM ACTIVE DUTY START DATE (ADSD).
ONLY SAILORS WHOSE ADSD IS 2 SEPTEMBER 1997 OR EARLIER ARE ELIGIBLE.
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS WILL NOT BE WAIVED.

3.  APPLICATION PROCEDURES FOR EARLY RETIREMENT:  ANY QUALIFYING MEMBER WHO 
DESIRES EARLY RETIREMENT UNDER TERA MUST SUBMIT AN APPLICATION TO NAVY 
PERSONNEL COMMAND (PERS-835) USING THE FOLLOWING
PROCEDURES:
    A.  DEADLINE:  APPLICATIONS FOR EARLY RETIREMENT MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER 
THAN 15 JUNE 2012.
    B.  APPLICATION FORMAT:  ALL APPLICATIONS FOR EARLY RETIREMENT UNDER TERA, 
WITH COMMAND ENDORSEMENT, WILL BE SUBMITTED BY THE APPLICANT'S LOCAL PERSONAL 
SUPPORT DETACHMENT (PSD)/PERSONNEL OFFICE USING OFFICER PERSONNEL INFORMATION 
SYSTEM (OPINS) OR NAVY STANDARD INTEGRATED PERSONNEL SYSTEM (NSIPS) FORCE 
MANAGEMENT (FORMAN) EVENT.
ENTER THE PROGRAM CODE "E" IN EITHER SYSTEM TO INDICATE TERA REQUEST.  THE 
COMMAND'S PASS LIAISON REPRESENTATIVE WILL COORDINATE WITH THE LOCAL PSD.   
APPLICATION PROCEDURES MUST BE FOLLOWED EXACTLY AS ANY ERRORS WILL DELAY 
PROCESSING AND RESULT IN MESSAGE REJECTION AND A REQUIREMENT FOR RESUBMISION.
    C.  RETIREMENT DATES:  REQUESTED EFFECTIVE RETIREMENT DATE MUST BE NOT 
LATER THAN 1 SEPTEMBER 2012.  TERA ELIGIBLE ERB SAILORS WHO COMPLETE 15 YEARS 
OF SERVICE PRIOR TO 1 SEPTEMBER 2012 MAY REQUEST AN EARLIER RETIREMENT DATE 
(30 JUNE, 31 JULY, OR 31 AUGUST) AS APPLICABLE.  APPROVAL OF RETIREMENT DATES 
PRIOR TO 31 AUGUST IS DEPENDENT UPON NOTIFICATION FROM THE OFFICE OF THE 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (OSD) THAT DEFENSE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING SERVICE (DFAS) 
HAS MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO BEGIN PROVIDING TERA RETIREMENT PAYMENTS.
SAILORS QUALIFIED FOR EARLY RETIREMENT UNDER TERA, BUT WHO MAY BE REQUIRED TO 
REMAIN ON ACTIVE DUTY BEYOND 1 SEPTEMBER 2012 ON OPERATIONAL WAIVERS OR TO 
COMPLETE INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE (IA)/GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR SUPPORT ASSIGNMENT 
(GSA)/OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATION SUPPORT ASSIGNMENT (OSA) TOUR 
REQUIREMENTS, WILL HAVE THEIR REQUESTED RETIREMENT DATE ADJUDICATED ON A CASE-
BY-CASE BASIS.
    D.  APPLICATION PROCESSING:  SAILORS MAY CHECK ON THE STATUS OF THEIR 
APPLICATION THROUGH BUPERS ONLINE BY CHOOSING "APPLICATION (FORMAN) STATUS".
    E.  9/11 GI BILL TRANSFERABILITY:  SAILORS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO TRANSFER GI 
BILL BENEFITS ONCE A TERA APPLICATION IS APPROVED.

4.  COMPUTATION OF TERA RETIRED PAY:  THE BASIC FORMULA FOR CALCULATING TERA 
RETIRED PAY CAN BE FOUND IN REF C.  SPECIFIC PROCEDURES FOR CALCULATING TERA 
RETIRED PAY, INCLUDING FOR THOSE SAILORS WHO ELECTED TO RECEIVE A CAREER 
STATUS BONUS (CSB) UNDER THE REDUCED RETIREMENT (REDUX) PLAN, WILL BE 
PUBLISHED ON THE ERB WEBSITE, AT HTTP://WWW.PUBLIC.NAVY.MIL/BUPERS-
NPC/BOARDS/ERB/PAGES/DEFAULT2.ASPX.

5.  BENEFITS AND OBLIGATIONS FOR TERA RETIREES.  TRANSITION ASSISTANCE 
BENEFITS FOR TERA RETIREES ARE THE SAME AS A 20-YEAR RETIREMENT, EXCEPT FOR 
PAY CALCULATION AND PUBLIC AND COMMUNITY SERVICE (PACS) REGISTRY, IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH REF C.
    A.  PACS REGISTRY:  TERA RETIREES ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER FOR PACS, BUT 
ARE NOT REQUIRED TO ACCEPT EMPLOYMENT.  PACS REGISTRATION CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED 
AT THE NEAREST MILITARY TRANSITION SITE (NORMALLY THE FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT 
CENTER).  DEPLOYED SAILORS AND THOSE WITHOUT ACCESS TO A TRANSITION OFFICE CAN 
SEND APPLICATIONS TO THEIR NEAREST HOMEPORT FLEET AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTER.  
VERIFICATION OF REGISTRATION WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED DURING CHECK-OUT PROCEDURES.  
THE NATIONAL REGISTRY CONTAINS JOBS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES:  EDUCATION, 
LAW ENFORCEMENT, PUBLIC HEALTH CARE, SOCIAL SERVICES, PUBLIC SAFETY, EMERGENCY 
RELIEF, PUBLIC HOUSING, AND CONSERVATION AND ENVIRONMENT.  UNLIKE PREVIOUS 
APPLICATIONS OF TERA, ACCEPTING PACS EMPLOYMENT AFTER MILITARY RETIREMENT WILL 
NOT EARN CREDIT TOWARD A 20-YEAR RETIREMENT.
    B.  SURVIVOR BENEFIT PLAN (SBP):  SBP IS A WAY FOR RETIREES TO PROVIDE A 
PORTION OF THEIR RETIRED PAY TO SURVIVING ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES.  HOWEVER, 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIGN UP FOR THIS IMPORTANT BENEFIT COMES ONLY AT 
RETIREMENT, AND A DECISION NOT TO ENROLL IS IRREVOCABLE.  THEREFORE, IT IS 
IMPERATIVE THAT APPLICANTS CONSULT WITH THEIR CAREER COUNSELORS FOR FULL 
INFORMATION ON SBP OPTIONS.
    C.  ERB SAILORS APPROVED FOR EARLY RETIREMENT WILL BE QQQQ VOLUNTARILY 
RETIRED NOT LATER THAN 1 SEPTEMBER 2012 (EXCEPT AS NOTED IN PARAGRAPH 3.C 
ABOVE) AND WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION PAY (ISP).  WHILE 
THOSE SAILORS OFFERED EARLY RETIREMENT WILL NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR ISP, THEY 
WILL REMAIN QUALIFIED FOR ENHANCED ERB TRANSITION BENEFITS UNTIL THEIR 
RETIREMENT DATE.
SAILORS MAY BE ABLE TO RETIRE PRIOR TO 1 SEPTEMBER 2012 IF THEIR APPLICATION 
FOR EARLY RETIREMENT IS APPROVED AND THEY HAVE COMPLETED AT LEAST 15 YEARS OF 
ACTIVE SERVICE.

6.  SHORT TERM EXTENSION (STE).  PER REF A, ELIGIBLE SAILORS DESIRING TO APPLY 
FOR EARLY RETIREMENT, WHOSE CURRENT EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE 
(EAOS) AS EXTENDED, OR "SOFT" EAOS (SEAOS), IS PRIOR TO 1 SEPTEMBER 2012 
SHOULD SUBMIT A STE REQUEST TO NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (PERS-81).
    A.  STE INCREMENTS:  PER REF D, EXTENSIONS SHALL BE EXECUTED IN MONTHLY 
INCREMENTS.  STE REQUESTS SHALL NOT BE FOR AN INCREMENT WHICH WOULD RESULT IN 
THE MEMBER'S SEAOS EXCEEDING SEPTEMBER 2012 UNLESS THE SAILOR IS APPROVED FOR 
AN OPERATIONAL WAIVER.  EXAMPLE:
AN ELIGIBLE SAILOR WITH A CURRENT EAOS OF 5 JUNE 2012 MAY REQUEST A STE NOT TO 
EXCEED THREE MONTHS, BECAUSE A STE OF FOUR OR MORE MONTHS WOULD RESULT IN A 
SEAOS AFTER SEPTEMBER 2012.
NOTE:  SINCE NAVPERSCOM COMPUTER SYSTEMS ONLY ALLOW STE INCREMENTS IN MONTHS, 
A SAILOR MAY BE GRANTED A STE THAT APPEARS TO EXTEND THEIR REMAINING ACTIVE 
SERVICE BEYOND 1 SEPTEMBER 2012.  HOWEVER, ERB MANDATORY SEPARATION DATE WILL 
STILL TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER THE STE.
    B.  STE REQUEST PROCEDURES:  ALL REQUESTS SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL TO 
PERS-81(AT)NAVY.MIL.
        (1) COMMANDING OFFICERS MUST ENDORSE STE REQUESTS PRIOR TO SUBMISSION 
TO PERS-81.
        (2) THE FOLLOWING EMAIL SAMPLE FORMAT SHALL BE USED FOR REQUEST 
SUBMISSION:

FROM:  COMMANDING OFFICER, VFA-XX

FIELDS.  SHOULD AN EDLN RELATED ERROR OCCUR, SERVICING PSD MUST CONTACT PERS-
835 FOR ASSISTANCE.)

SAILORS WHO HAVE STE APPROVED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF APPLYING FOR EARLY

EARLY RETIREMENT DISAPPROVAL OR THE ORIGINAL EAOS/SEAOS, WHICHEVER IS LATER.

7.  BOARD FOR CORRECTION OF NAVAL RECORDS (BCNR).  ELIGIBLE MEMBERS WHO WERE 
DISCHARGED ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF REF E (31 DECEMBER 2011), WHO 
WERE UNABLE TO COMPLETE AN APPLICATION FOR EARLY RETIREMENT UNDER TERA WHILE 
ON ACTIVE DUTY, MAY PETITION BCNR IN ACCORDANCE WITH REF F IF EARLY RETIREMENT
