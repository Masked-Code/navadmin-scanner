NARR/REF A IS DOD POLICY ON TIP.  IT DETAILS THE CRIMINAL
NATURE OF TIP AND OUTLINES ENTERPRISE ACTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
NECESSARY TO PREVENT, MITIGATE OR AVOID EITHER PURPOSEFULLY OR
UNWITTINGLY PARTICIPATING IN THOSE ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING SEXUAL
EXPLOITATION, FORCED PROSTITUTION, INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE AND DEBT
BONDAGE.   REF B ANNOUNCES PLANNED AVAILABILITY OF AN ON LINE
TRAINING PACKAGE THAT INFORMS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY, EXAMINES THE
PHENOMENON OF TIP, DESCRIBES WAYS TO IDENTIFY PERSONS THAT ARE
TRAFFICKED, AND DESCRIBES THE LEGAL PROVISIONS AND THEIR
CONSEQUENCES FOR PARTICIPATING IN TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS.  REF C IS
SECNAV MEMO ESTABLISHING DON POLICY ON TIP AND TRAINING
REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL DON PERSONNEL.//
RMKS/1.  DOD POLICY ESTABLISHED IN REF A IS AMPLFIED IN
REF C.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE REQUIRED ACTION TO
BE TAKEN BY ALL NAVY PERSONNEL (MILITARY, CIVILIAN, INDIRECT HIRES
AND CONTRACT PERSONNEL).
2.  ALL NAVY PERSONNEL SHALL BE TRAINED ON OSD TIP POLICY AND SHALL
BE FAMILIAR WITH THOSE ACTIONS NECESSARY TO AVOID SITUATIONS,
PERSONS AND ESTABLISHMENTS THAT PARTICIPATE IN OR FOSTER TIP.  AN
ONLINE TRAINING PACKAGE, DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO SATISFY THE OSD
POLICY, HAS BEEN POSTED ON NAVY KNOWLEDGE ONLINE (NKO).  TO ACCESS
THE TRAINING, LOG ON TO NKO AT WWW.NKO.NAVY.MIL.  UNDER THE
LEARNING TAB, SELECT NAVY E-LEARNING.  THIS WILL AUTO LOG THE USER
ON TO THE NAVY E-LEARNING WEBSITE.  SCROLL DOWN TO FIND THE
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS BASIC AWARENESS TRAINING COURSE.
ALTERNATIVELY, THE TRAINING PACKAGE CAN BE ACCESSED FROM (LOWER
CASE) HTTP:/WWW.JKDDCJMO.ORG.  TIP TRAINING TAKES ABOUT 30 MINUTES
TO COMPLETE.  COMMANDERS SHOULD USE NKO TO LOAD COURSE COMPLETION,
THUS ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY OF TRAINING RECEIVED.
3.  BY 1 DEC 05 COMMANDERS AND LEADERS OF ALL NAVY UNITS SHALL
ENSURE THAT ALL NAVY PERSONNEL ASSIGNED THEIR UNITS HAVE COMPLETED
THE TIP AWARENESS TRAINING PACKAGE, UNDERSTAND AND RECOGNIZE
INDICATORS OF TIP, AND HOW TO AVOID FOSTERING OR AIDING IT.
4.  TIP IS A SIGNIFICANT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT RESULTS IN THE
INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE OF THOUSANDS. SECDEF HAS STATED QUOTE NO
LEADER IN THIS DEPARTMENT SHOULD TURN A BLIND EYE TO THIS ISSUE
UNQUOTE.  TIP IS A VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, IT IS INCOMPATIBLE
WITH NAVY CORE VALUES, AND IT UNDERMINES OUR MISSION.  I ECHO THE
SECRETARY'S STRONG AND CLEAR STATEMENT REGARDING THE
RESPONSIBILITIES OF NAVAL LEADERSHIP AT ALL LEVELS TO BE VIGILANT IN
OBSERVING THE INDICATORS OF TIP AND PROACTIVELY TAKING ACTION TO
COMBAT TIP, INCLUDING THE USE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL, AND CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES AND ALL OTHER AVAILABLE TOOLS.
