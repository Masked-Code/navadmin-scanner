RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces Detailing Marketplace Assignment Policy 
(DMAP) Phase II.  Beginning with the December 2022 MyNavy Assignment (MNA) 
cycle, Active Component Sailors in the following four sea-intensive ratings 
will be incorporated into DMAP in line with references (a) and (b) as well as 
additional guidance below: 
          MM(B130)          IC(B230) 
          DC(B200)          RS(B730) 
DMAP Phase I ratings (ABH, ABF, GSM, and CS) continue in DMAP. 
 
2.  Sailors on sea duty in these four DMAP Phase II ratings with projected 
rotation dates (PRD) on or before 1 December 2023 may opt out of DMAP for 
their upcoming assignment process and enter the legacy sea shore flow 
marketplace in line with references (c) and (d) by submitting an Electronic 
Personnel Action Request (NAVPERS 1306/7) to their detailer, via their 
command no later than 15 November 2022.  All other Sailors in the four DMAP 
Phase II ratings will be automatically enrolled in DMAP and have their PRDs 
updated accordingly. 
 
3.  References (a) and (b) are now applicable to DMAP Phase II ratings. 
Anywhere guidance is specified for DMAP Phase I ratings will now be read as 
applying to both Phase I and Phase II ratings. 
 
4.  DMAP program information including quota allocations, Sailor Scoring 
Criteria (see Distribution Guidance Memorandum 4092-2206), and frequently 
asked questions can be found at the Detailing Marketplace tab on the MyNavy 
HR website at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
Management/Detailing/Enlisted/Detailing-Marketplace/. 
 
5.  To ensure clarity with respect to references (a) and (b), all DMAP 
Sailors who are not selected for a journeyman (E-5) sea tour or a shore tour 
after three MNA cycles will have their PRDs adjusted to align with their soft 
end of active obligated service and remain eligible for continued 
opportunities in the Marketplace until end of active obligated service. 
 
6.  DMAP Sailors are encouraged to respond to pulse surveys after negotiating 
for orders in order to help continue to enhance DMAP. 
 
7.  Points of Contact: 
    a.  For specific rate/rating/Navy enlisted classification questions and 
concerns, Sailors should contact their respective community manager or 
detailer. 
    b.  For general career information, including questions about Detailing 
Marketplace Incentive Program, Advance-to-Position, Command Advance to 
Position, or Continuous Sea Duty Credit, contact MyNavy Career Center contact 
center at 833-330-MNCC (6622) or askmncc(at)navy.mil. 
    c.  For DMAP questions, contact the MyNavy HR DMAP team at 
DMAP.fct(at)navy.mil. 
 
8.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
