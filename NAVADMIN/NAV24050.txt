RMKS/1. This message shall be read in its entirety to ensure all stakeholders 
in the ship inactivation process are aware of the projected retirement 
schedule for fiscal year 2024 (FY24), their respective responsibilities, 
necessary follow-up actions, and planning required. Ship retirement decisions 
reflected in paragraph 2 below are adjusted for completed Congressional 
action.  This plan will be adjusted if necessary based on subsequent 
execution year decisions made by leadership or as required by Congressional 
action.

2. To facilitate fleet planning efforts to conduct decommissioning continuous 
maintenance availability (CMAV) or inactivation availability (INAC), the 
projected schedule for inactivating U.S. battle force and non-battle force 
naval vessels in FY24 is promulgated as follows:
Ship Name                     Proj Inactive Date       Post Inactive Status
USS ANTIETAM (CG 54)               27 SEP 24                     LSA
USS LEYTE GULF (CG 55)             27 SEP 24                     LSA
USS COWPENS (CG 63)                30 AUG 24                     LSA
USS VICKSBURG (CG 69)              29 JUN 24                     LSA
USS SAN JUAN (SSN 751)             12 AUG 24                   RECYCLE

3. Per ref (b), Fleet Commanders shall submit an Organizational Change 
Request for commissioned U.S. ships to formally notify the Office of the 
Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) of a ship's decommissioning, inactivation, 
or end of service.  Submit revisions due to operational schedule changes per 
references (a) and (b).  It is the responsibility of Commander, U.S. Fleet 
Forces Command and Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet in coordination with their 
respective Type Commanders (TYCOM) to ensure the appropriate lower echelon 
commands are notified of any changes in the ship inactivation schedules, as 
well as Director, Integrated Warfare (OPNAV N9I) and OPNAV resource sponsor.

4. Adjustments to paragraph 2 ship inactivations that cross the current 
fiscal year must be coordinated with OPNAV N9I due to Congressional 
requirements for execution year force structure changes that differ from what 
Congress authorized/appropriated and signed into law by the President.  OPNAV 
shall promulgate changes to the inactivation fiscal year as required.

5. Per ref (a), the ships listed in paragraph 2 as Logistics Support Assets
(LSA) will be used as a primary means of cannibalization and equipment 
removal for ships.  Cannibalizations and equipment removal from these vessels 
is authorized without replacement.

6. The ship's commanding officer, masters, or Immediate Superior In Command, 
shall submit a final naval message (normally transmitted in conjunction with 
the decommissioning ceremony) announcing the ship's official retirement date 
and include a brief history of the significant events in the life of the ship 
per ref (a).  The Naval History and Heritage Command (NAVHISTHERITAGE 
WASHINGTON DC) and Naval Vessel Register Custodian (NVR NORFOLK VA), shall be 
included as INFO addresses.

7. Released by VADM J. E. Pitts, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for 
Warfighting Requirements and Capabilities (N9).//
