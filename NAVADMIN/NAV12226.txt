SUBJ/CHANGES IN ENLISTED DISTRIBUTION TO IMPROVE SEA DUTY MANNING//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES NEW INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE SEA DUTY MANNING 
ON OUR DEPLOYING UNITS.  IN THE DYNAMIC GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT, ONE CONSTANT IS 
THE CONSISTENT DEMANDS ON OUR SEA-GOING FORCES TO PROVIDE CAPABILITY AROUND 
THE WORLD.  TO PROVIDE THIS CRITICAL CAPABILITY, OUR TOP PRIORITY IS TO 
ADEQUATELY MAN AND TRAIN DEPLOYED UNITS TO MEET ALL MISSION REQUIREMENTS.
OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS, WE INTRODUCED SEVERAL VOLUNTARY AND STRUCTURAL 
MEASURES TO IMPROVE AT-SEA MANNING:  VOLUNTARY SEA DUTY PROGRAM (VSDP), 
EXPANDED SEA DUTY INCENTIVE PAY (SDIP), SEA SHORE FLOW UPDATES, ADDITIONAL SEA 
DUTY BILLETS IN FUTURE YEARS, AND INCREASED ACCESSIONS.  WHILE THESE ACTIONS 
GAIN TRACTION, ADDITIONAL MEASURES ARE NECESSARY TO REDUCE GAPS IN CRITICAL 
SKILLS AND SUPERVISORY MANNING ON UNITS ABOUT TO DEPLOY.  OVER THE COURSE OF 
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, WE WILL IMPLEMENT CHANGES TO EXISTING DISTRIBUTION 
POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND SYSTEMS TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS GAPS WHICH ARE 
CURRENTLY FILLED ON SHORT NOTICE WITH SAILORS DIVERTED OR CROSS-DECKED FROM 
OTHER UNITS.  FORTHCOMING EFFORTS INCLUDE CHANGES TO THE CAREER MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM INTERACTIVE DETAILING
(CMS/ID) PROCESS AS OUTLINED IN THIS MESSAGE, REVISIONS TO DETAILING BUSINESS 
RULES FOR SAILORS WITH CRITICAL SKILLS IN HIGH DEMAND TO RETURN TO SEA EARLY 
FROM SHORE DUTY, AND AN UPDATE TO THE VSDP.
THESE ADDITIONAL INITIATIVES WILL BE PROMULGATED VIA SEPARATE NAVADMINS.

2.  THIS NAVADMIN SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES CHANGES TO THE CAREER MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM INTERACTIVE DETAILING (CMS/ID) PROCESS.  BASED ON FLEET FEEDBACK 
REGARDING MANNING DEFICIENCIES AND FIT/FILL, THE ORDER NEGOTIATION PROCESS 
USING CMS/ID HAS CHANGED TO PROVIDE GREATER PREDICTABILITY IN FUTURE MANNING 
AND REDUCE SHORT NOTICE MANNING ACTIONS INCLUDING CROSSDECKS AND DIVERTS.
    A.  CMS/ID PRESENTLY USES A COMBINATION OF RED AND GREEN ZONE REQUISITIONS 
TO ADVERTISE AVAILABLE BILLETS.  THE RED ZONE REFLECTS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY 
FLEET BILLETS WHICH ARE FILLED EACH MONTH.
GREEN ZONE REQUISITIONS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE FILLED EACH MONTH LEADING TO 
UNPREDICTABILITY IN FUTURE MANNING AND, IN SOME CASES, CAUSING SHORT NOTICE 
MANNING ACTIONS.  BEGINNING WITH THE AUGUST 2012 CMS/ID CYCLE, A SINGLE SET OF 
SEA AND SHORE BILLETS, AS ESTABLISHED BY MANNING CONTROL AUTHORITIES, WILL BE 
ADVERTISED AND FILLED EACH CYCLE.
    B.  SAILORS ENTERING INTO THEIR CMS/ID NEGOTIATION WINDOW RETAIN THE 
ABILITY TO APPLY FOR JOBS FROM THE CURRENT SLATE OF BILLETS ADVERTISED IN 
THEIR RATING/PAYGRADE.
    C.  SAILORS SHOULD SUBMIT FIVE APPLICATIONS FOR ADVERTISED JOBS TO ENSURE 
THEIR DESIRES ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.  FAILURE TO PROVIDE AN INPUT MAY RESULT 
IN ASSIGNMENT OF A SAILOR TO A JOB WITHOUT THE SAILOR'S DESIRES CONSIDERED.  
SAILORS SHOULD PROVIDE INPUT EACH MONTH DURING THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS ON 
CMS/ID OR VIA E-MAIL/PHONE TO THEIR DETAILER.  INPUT VIA THE COMMAND CAREER 
COUNSELOR ON THE SAILOR'S BEHALF IS ALSO ACCEPTABLE.
    D.  SINCE ALL BILLETS ADVERTISED ON CMS/ID WILL BE FILLED EACH MONTH, 
DETAILERS MAY BE REQUIRED TO SELECT A SAILOR WHO HAS NOT APPLIED FOR THE 
ASSIGNMENT OR IS EARLY IN THEIR NEGOTIATION WINDOW.
DETAILERS WILL ATTEMPT TO FILL ALL BILLETS USING A SAILOR'S DESIRED SELECTIONS 
FIRST, HOWEVER, FLEET READINESS REQUIREMENTS WILL ULTIMATELY BE THE GUIDING 
FACTOR IN THE SAILOR'S ASSIGNMENT.  SAILORS NEARING THE END OF THEIR 
NEGOTIATION WINDOW WILL GENERALLY BE CHOSEN TO FILL ASSIGNMENTS THEY DID NOT 
APPLY FOR OVER SAILORS WHO ARE AT THE START OF THEIR NEGOTIATION WINDOW.

3.  THE KEYS TO SUCCESS REGARDING THESE CHANGES ARE COMMAND LEADERSHIP 
INVOLVEMENT INCLUDING PROACTIVE COMMUNICATION OF THESE CHANGES, AGGRESSIVE AND 
THOROUGH CAREER REVIEW BOARDS AND COMMAND MANAGEMENT OF ENLISTED DISTRIBUTION 
VERIFICATION REPORTS.
SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE AND PROGRAM DETAILS WILL BE PROVIDED VIA ADDITIONAL 
NAVADMINS, UPDATED MILPERSMAN ARTICLES AND THE CMS/ID WEBSITE, AS APPLICABLE.  
QUESTIONS CONCERNING THIS NAVADMIN SHOULD BE REFERRED TO THE NPC CUSTOMER 
SERVICE CENTER AT 1-(866)-U-ASK-NPC OR (866) 827-5672 OR VIA E-MAIL AT 
CSCMAILBOX(AT)NAVY.MIL.
