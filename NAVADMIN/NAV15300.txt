2.  The Lateral Transfer/Redesignation Board was extremely competitive.  Each 
record that was presented to the board was carefully reviewed and the best 
and fully qualified were chosen.

3.  Quota constraints for junior year groups (10 through 16) were especially 
tight, thus the demand signal far exceeded the supply pool.  Many quality 
applicants were identified by the board but could not be selected due to 
quota constraints of either the outgoing community or the gaining community.  
Applicants who were not selected this year should apply again while 
sustaining superior performance and bolstering their record for desired 
communities.

4.  As always, competition for redesignation was keen and every community had 
a pool of highly qualified candidates.  Eligible officers not initially 
selected, and who did not specifically request not to be reviewed by 
communities other than their first or second choice, were subsequently 
reviewed by all other communities. Those officers tentatively selected for 
communities not initially requested will be notified via official 
correspondence and offered the opportunity to redesignate.

5.  This message is not authority to deliver change of designator letters to 
the selectees.  Officers who are promotion selectees should contact their 
current detailer to discuss redesignation timing.  Commander, Navy Personnel 
Command (COMNAVPERSCOM) (PERS-803), upon notification by COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-
4) that the selectees have been made available to their new communities, will 
forward redesignation letters to selectees or appointment acceptance and oath 
of office (NAVPERS 1000/4), as applicable.  Officers who are not promotion 
selectees and who are not under orders can expect assignment to a new billet 
appropriate to their new designation when notified by COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4).  
If an officer is currently under orders and transfers prior to notification 
by COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4), member must execute orders under current 
designator and must complete 12 months at the new assignment, unless a 
shorter tour is prescribed (tours in excess of one year will be with the 
concurrence of the gaining community), prior to redesignation.

6.  The following are exceptions to the above:
    a.  Surface Warfare Officers (11xx) who are under orders to department 
head school may not lateral transfer until completion of initial department 
head tour.
    b.  Aviation Officers (131x and 132x) shall not be permitted to lateral 
transfer until completion of active-duty service obligation, expiration of 
aviation career continuation pay contract, or planned rotation date, 
whichever is later.
    c.  Selectees for Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer (151x) who are 
presently designated 131x or 132x and have not completed a second sea tour or 
aviation department head tour may be delayed assignment to 151x billets until 
the completion of an applicable second sea and or aviation department head 
tour, as determined by COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-43).

7.  Commanding Officers shall:
    a.  Ensure officers selected for promotion within their current community 
do not accept redesignation before their promotion date.
    b.  Notify COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-803) within 30 days of release of this 
message of any selectee that does not desire to accept 
transfer/redesignation.

8.  The next Lateral Transfer/Redesignation Board will be held on 31 May 
2016.  Applications must be received by 25 March 2016. Previous applications 
are not retained; non-selectees from previous boards must submit a new 
application for consideration.  A future NAVADMIN will stipulate all of the 
eligibility requirements and application procedures per references (a) 
through (d).

9.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
