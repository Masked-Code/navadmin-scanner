RMKS/1.  This message announces the Navy's education opportunities through 
the Center of Excellence in Logistics and Technology (LOGTECH) Institute for 
Defense and Business, University of North Carolina (UNC) during fiscal year 
2022 (FY22).  LOGTECH enables and energizes participants to improve 
operations and accelerate adoption of future logistics capabilities 
throughout their organizations.  Since 2001, LOGTECH has brought together key 
military officials from the Department of Defense (DoD), U.S. government 
executives, academic thought leaders, and senior private sector participants 
to explore crucial and timely issues in logistics, supporting technologies, 
and business practices.  Partnering with the Kenan-Flagler Business School at 
UNC-Chapel Hill, LOGTECH offers two distinct education programs for military, 
DoD, and private sector personnel:
     a.  LOGTECH Executive Course.  This program is designed for military 
Flag Officers and Senior Executive Service members to focus on strategic and 
organizational considerations from the senior executive perspective.  FY22 
Executive Course schedule:
Class #   Start          Graduate        Quotas    Application Deadline
2022-01   20 Jun 2022    24 Jun 2022     3         29 Apr 2022
     b.  LOGTECH Advanced Course.  The LOGTECH Staff at UNC uses lectures and 
working groups to explore leading-edge logistics technologies to prepare
DoD logisticians for the future.  This program is designed for CWO-4 to CWO-5 
and O-4 to O-6 military officers and E-9 enlisted personnel, as well as GS-13 
to GS-15 civilians.  FY22 LOGTECH Advanced Course schedule:
Class #   Start          Graduate        Quotas    Application Deadline
2022-02   12 Dec 2021    17 Dec 2021     3         05 Nov 2021
2022-03   08 May 2022    13 May 2022     3         31 Mar 2022
2022-04   07 Aug 2022    12 Aug 2022     TBD       24 Jun 2022
     c.  LOGTECH is traditionally hosted in-residence at the Kenan-Flagler 
Business School at UNC, Chapel Hill.  The ongoing COVID-19 mitigation may 
dictate hosting FY22 LOGTECH courses virtually.  Please note that Advanced 
Class # 2022-04 is tentative, reserved for any Agency(s)/DoD Component(s) 
that would like to self-fund a course.
     d.  To obtain LOGTECH Advanced or Executive Course quotas, contact the 
Navy LOGTECH course manager.  All applicants must submit a standard Navy 
biography and signed SF-182.  Advanced course applicants must also include a 
logistics problem statement for exploration during the course.  Navy course 
managers will provide all interested applicants an SF-182 with instructions, 
and a sample problem statement.  The Navys FY22 course managers are:
CDR Adesina Ekundayo, OPNAV N4L13P, adesina.ekundayo2@navy.mil
Ms. Meghan Picha, OPNAV N4L13O, meghan.d.picha.ctr@us.navy.mil
     e.  LOGTECH is a competitive program.  Selections are based on the 
following criteria:  candidate qualifications (specifically career field and 
paygrade qualifications), package completeness (biography, SF-182, and 
problem statement), and the quality of the problem statement.
     f.  For additional course information, refer to the LOGTECH Web site at 
http://www.idb.org/programs/in-residence-learning/logtech-advanced-advanced-
program-in-logistics-technology/.
 
2.  Funding.  Tuition, travel, lodging, and partial per diem are centrally 
funded in FY22.  Commands are responsible for funding per diem on the days of 
travel only.  Services, agencies, and combatant commands also have the option 
to self-fund seats for any of the above classes.  Self-funded seats will be 
coordinated directly with the Institute for Defense and Business.  Program 
cost is $9K per attendee and covers room, board, and tuition.
