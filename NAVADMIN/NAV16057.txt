RMKS/1.  At the beginning of each calendar year, eligible voters who wish to 
register to vote absentee should do so by completing the Federal Post Card 
Application (FPCA).  The FPCA form can easily be completed online at:
http://www.fvap.gov.

2.  Another election cycle begins in 2016 with numerous federal, state, and 
local elections being held, to include the Presidential Election.  Choosing 
our leaders through open elections makes democracy unique and is a freedom 
that we defend.  Everyone is encouraged to exercise their right to vote and 
to ensure that their voice is heard.

3.  The Navy maintains a robust service-wide Voting Assistance Program that 
relies upon leadership support at every level of the chain of command.  The 
following guidance is provided:
    a.  Commanders, Commanding Officers, and Officers in Charge:
Every command of 25 or more individuals is required to maintain a voting 
assistance program, managed by a command Voting Assistance Officer (VAO).
    b.  Voting Assistance Officers:
        (1) Duties and responsibilities are outlined in references
(a) and (b).
        (2) VAOs must establish an account in the Federal Voting Assistance 
Program (FVAP) online portal at
https://www.fvap.gov/portal/login/welcome.html and will report assistance 
metrics on a quarterly basis via this tool, while maintaining copies of these 
metrics for their records. VAOs with voting issues or questions are 
encouraged to contact the Navy VAO, by emailing vote(at)navy.mil.
        (3) VAOs must establish a voting distribution list for their command. 
It should be in the following format ?vote.command_name(at)navy.mil? and 
include all primary and assistant VAOs within that command as well as
vote(at)navy.mil.
        (4) Per federal law, all VAOs are required to have their performance 
commented on in an official military evaluation report.  To satisfy this 
requirement, all VAOs must list ?VAO? in the collateral duty block of their 
official evaluation or fitness report.
        (5) The voting action plan outlines specific guidance to support the 
Navy Voting Assistance Program throughout 2016 and can be found at 
http://www.fvap.gov/vao/guidance/html. Voters who need assistance with the 
absentee voting process should contact their command Voting Assistance 
Officer, visit www.fvap.gov, or email vote(at)navy.mil.

kristin.hope(at)navy.mil or (202)433-4000.
