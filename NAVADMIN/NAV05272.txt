SUBJ/CNO GUIDANCE FOR 2006: MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF A NEW ERA//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  I HAVE RELEASED MY GUIDANCE FOR 2006,  MEETING
THE CHALLENGE OF A NEW ERA, AND POSTED IT ONLINE AT WWW.NAVY.MIL.
2.  THE GUIDANCE ARTICULATES A LONG-TERM VISION FOR OUR NAVY, LAYS
OUT OUR MISSION IN DEFENSE OF THIS NATION, AND REITERATES THE
PRIORITIES I INTEND TO FOCUS ON.  MY PRIORITIES HAVE NOT CHANGED.



PAGE 02 RUEWMFU3002 UNCLAS
WE WILL SUSTAIN OUR READINESS FOR THE WAR ON TERROR AND ANY OTHER
ARMED CONFLICT; WE WILL BUILD A FLEET FOR THE FUTURE OF THE RIGHT
SIZE AND MIX OF CAPABILITIES; AND WE WILL DEVELOP 21ST CENTURY
LEADERS THROUGH A TRANSFORMED MANPOWER, PERSONNEL, TRAINING, AND
EDUCATION ORGANIZATION.
3.  I ALSO OUTLINE SEVEN KEY OBJECTIVES FOR 2006, COMPLETE WITH
DESIRED EFFECTS AND SPECIFIC TASKING TO HELP ACCOMPLISH EACH OF
THEM.  THOSE OBJECTIVES ARE TO: 1) WIN THE WAR ON TERROR AND
STAY READY TO MEET OTHER OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS; 2) DETERMINE AND
DELIVER ON THE NAVY S FUTURE FORCE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS; 3) DRIVE
TO EXECUTION SEA WARRIOR AND OTHER ONGOING MANPOWER AND PERSONNEL
TRANSFORMATIONAL EFFORTS; 4) WITH THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS,
INCREASE THE VALUE OF NAVAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE JOINT FORCE; 5)
DEVELOP CLOSER WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE UNITED STATES COAST
GUARD AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS; 6)
APPLY EFFECTS-BASED THINKING ACROSS THE NAVY; AND 7) BECOME LEADERS
OF CHANGE AND INNOVATION.
4.  AS I MAKE CLEAR THROUGHOUT MY GUIDANCE, WE ARE A NATION AND A
NAVY AT WAR.  AND WE ARE PERFORMING MAGNIFICENTLY.  I COULD NOT BE
MORE PROUD OF THE SERVICE AND SACRIFICE OF ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN

SERVING OUR NAVY TODAY -- AND THEIR FAMILIES.  BUT WE ARE ALSO
LIVING ON THE CUSP OF A NEW ERA PLAGUED BY UNCERTAINTY AND CHANGE.
IT IS AN ERA THAT CALLS FOR NEW SKILL SETS, DEEPER PARTNERSHIPS,
MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING, AND -- WITH THE GREAT MAJORITY OF
INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE STILL MOVING ON THE WORLD S OCEANS -- A FIRM
COMMITMENT TO THE INCREDIBLE POWER RESIDENT IN THE SEA ITSELF.  WE
WILL ANSWER THAT CALL.
5.  HARNESSING SEA POWER IN THE 21ST CENTURY WILL DEMAND MUCH MORE
OF US THAN SIMPLY PUTTING ORDNANCE ON TARGET.  IT WILL DEMAND THE
ABILITY TO AGGREGATE AND DISAGGREGATE FORCES QUICKLY; IT WILL DEMAND
HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED NETWORKS, CONNECTIVITY, AND STEALTH; IT WILL
DEMAND BETTER JOINT AND INTERAGENCY COOPERATION; AND IT WILL DEMAND
THAT WE BUILD FOR THE FUTURE A NEW FLEET OF SHIPS, AIRCRAFT, AND
SUBMARINES TO WIELD THAT POWER ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF CONFLICT.  WE
WILL MEET THESE DEMANDS.  WE WILL BUILD THAT FLEET.
6.  OUR INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE IN COMBAT OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE
EAST AND RELIEF OPERATIONS OVERSEAS AND ON OUR OWN GULF COAST STAND
AS TESTAMENT TO THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF NAVAL FORCES TO NATIONAL
AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY.  WE ARE DOING GREAT THINGS.  THE SEA
POWER THE NAVY-MARINE CORPS TEAM REFLECTS IS THE REALITY THAT NAVAL

FORCES ARE NOT ONLY INSTRUMENTS OF WAR, BUT POWERFUL IMPLEMENTS FOR
PEACE.
7.  IT IS WITH A WEATHER EYE ON THIS DYNAMIC FUTURE THAT I CRAFTED
MY GUIDANCE.  I ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ IT, DISTRIBUTE IT AND DISCUSS
IT.  AS ALWAYS, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND YOUR SUPPORT.
8.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL MIKE MULLEN, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
