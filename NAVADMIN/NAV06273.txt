SUBJ/TASK FORCE INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION (TFIA) UPDATE//

GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR
(GWOT), OUR NAVY HAS DEPLOYED OVER 46,000 SAILORS AS INDIVIDUAL
AUGMENTEES (IA) TO THE VARIOUS COMBATANT COMMANDERS. TO BETTER
RECOGNIZE THE TREMENDOUS VALUE THAT NAVY INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEES MAKE
TO OUR NAVYS AND OUR NATIONS MISSION, THE NAVY IS IMPLEMENTING
INITIATIVES THAT RECOGNIZE, SUPPORT, AND REWARD SAILORS WHO COMPLETE
IA ASSIGNMENTS IN HAZARDOUS COMBAT ZONES. THIS NAVADMIN OUTLINES
THOSE INCENTIVES AND PROVIDES AN INITIAL SET OF BUSINESS RULES FOR
SOURCING AND ASSIGNMENT OF IAS. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS I PLAN
TO RELEASE ADDITIONAL NAVADMINS DETAILING THE SPECIFICS OF THE
INITIATIVES OUTLINED BELOW. ALTHOUGH THESE IA INITIATIVES ARE
FOCUSED CURRENTLY ON THE CENTCOM THEATER OF OPERATIONS, IF FUTURE
MISSION REQUIREMENTS DEMAND NAVY SAILORS TO FIGHT THE GLOBAL WAR
ON TERROR IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THESE INITIATIVES WILL BE
APPLIED TO INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN THOSE COMBATANT COMMANDS.

2. DISTRIBUTION INCENTIVES: OUR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FOR IAS HAS
CHANGED SINCE 2001. CURRENT PRIORITY GUIDANCE FOR DETAILERS IS:
A. RETURNING IAS ARE OUR #1 DISTRIBUTION PRIORITY,
B. WILL REMAIN FLEXIBLE IN BALANCING THE NEEDS OF
INDIVIDUAL CAREERS, FAMILIES, AND THE FLEET,
C. DETAILERS WILL PROACTIVELY ENGAGE IAS ON ORDERS.

3. THE FOLLOWING MEASURES ARE IN PLACE NOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS
GUIDANCE:
A. IA TOURS OVER 365 DAYS WILL BE CONSIDERED EQUIVALENT TO
FORWARD DEPLOYED NAVAL FORCES (FDNF) TOURS. ENLISTED AND OFFICER
DETAILERS WILL AFFORD THE SAME PRIORITY AND BENFITS TO IA PERSONNEL
SUCH AS COAST SELECTION PREFERENCE AND/OR PRIORITY CHOICE OF
FOLLOW-ON DUTY ASSIGNMENTS AND LOCATIONS.
B. PERS 4 WILL MAXIMIZE THE USE OF INTERIM TEMPORARY DUTY
(ITDY) ORDERS THAT ALLOW MOVEMENT OF FAMILIES TO ANOTHER LOCATION
WHILE THE SPONSOR IS ON AN IA ASSIGNMENT OF 365 DAYS OR MORE.
C. IAS COMING FROM SEA DUTY WILL MAINTAIN THEIR EXISTING SEA
\DUTY PROJECTED ROTATION DATES (PRDS).
D. ENLISTED IAS COMING FROM SHORE DUTY: FREEZING THE SHORE
DUTY CLOCK WITH THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES:
(1) 100% DAY FOR DAY CREDIT FOR AN IA TOUR SERVED IN
HAZARDOUS DUTY ZONES.
(2) 50% DAY FOR DAY CREDIT FOR AN IA TOUR SERVED OUTSIDE
HAZARDOUS DUTY ZONES.
(3) REDUCTION OF PRESCRIBED SEA TOUR (PST) FOR THOSE SAILORS
REQUIRED TO RETURN TO SEA (FOR NEEDS OF THE SERVICE) PRIOR TO
COMPLETION OF THEIR ADJUSTED SHORE DUTY TIME.
E. OFFICER IAS COMING FROM SHORE DUTY: DETAILERS WILL CONTACT
THE OFFICER TO DISCUSS OPTIONS WITH REGARD TO CAREER PROGRESSION,
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND TOUR LENGTHS TO MAXIMIZE THE LENGTH OF
A SHORE DUTY EXTENSION WHILE KEEPING THE OFFICERS CAREER ON TRACK
TO ACHIEVE ALL COMMUNITY MILESTONES.
F. THIS DISTRIBUTION GUIDANCE IS NOW IN EFFECT VIA DETAILER
GUIDANCE MEMORANDA AND WILL BE CAPTURED IN A FUTURE REVISION TO THE
MILPERSMAN.

4. ADVANCEMENT: THE MISSIONS THAT OUR IAS PERFORM ARE VITAL TO OUR
NAVY AND NATION. TO ENSURE OUR IAS ARE REWARDED FOR THIS SERVICE
AND
ARE NOT DISADVANTAGED IN OUR ADVANCEMENT PROCESS THE FOLLOWING
ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN (DETAILS TO BE PROMULGATED IN SEPARATE
NAVADMINS OVER THE NEXT TWO MONTHS).
A. SELECTION BOARD PRECEPT GUIDANCE: THE NAVY HAS CONDUCTED
A COMPLETE REVIEW OF SELECTION BOARD PRECEPT GUIDANCE AND IS ADDING
LANGUAGE TO RECOGNIZE THE GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS THAT OUR IA SAILORS
MAKE TO THE GWOT AND THE NAVY.
B. ADVANCEMENT EXAMS: OPTIONS FOR OUR SAILORS TO TAKE
SUBSTITUTE EXAMS ARE BEING EXPANDED (INCLUDING SUFFICIENT TIME FOR
PREPARATION) SO THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN AN ADVANCEMENT EXAM CYCLE
EITHER BEFORE DEPLOYMENT TO OR AFTER RETURN FROM DESIGNATED COMBAT
ZONES WITHIN CENTRAL COMMAND (CENTCOM) (IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, HOA).
THOSE SAILORS WHO WILL MISS AN ENTIRE EXAM CYCLE DUE TO THE LENGTH
OF THEIR COMBAT ZONE ASSIGNMENT, WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO
RETROACTIVELY APPLY THE RESULTS OF THEIR NEXT ADVANCEMENT EXAM TO
THE PREVIOUS (MISSED) CYCLE.
C. AWARD POINTS TOWARD ADVANCEMENT: EACH SAILOR WHO HAS
COMPLETED AN INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION TOUR GREATER THAN 179 DAYS
IN A DESIGNATED COMBAT ZONE (WITHIN CENTCOM (IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN,
HORN OF AFRICA (HOA)) WILL BE CREDITED TWO ADVANCEMENT AWARD
POINTS.

5. OFFICIAL CREDIT FOR IA: CREDIT FOR IA TOURS WILL BE CAPTURED
AND TRACKED AT SEVERAL LEVELS.
A. EVALUATIONS AND FITREPS: COMMANDERS AND COMMANDING OFFICERS
ARE DIRECTED TO DOCUMENT AN INDIVIDUAL'S IA ASSIGNMENT IN
EVALUATIONS/FITNESS REPORTS AND VERIFY THAT THEIR IAS RECEIVE A
CONCURRENT EVALUATION/FITNESS REPORT FROM THEIR IN-THEATER
COMMANDER.
B. NEC AND AQD: PERSONNEL WHO HAVE SERVED A GWOT-RELATED
IA, WILL RECEIVE AN IA ENLISTED NEC OR OFFICER AQD. DETAILS ON
THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, AND QUALIFICATIONS, TO EARN THE NEC/AQD
WILL BE PROMULGATED IN A FUTURE NAVADMIN.
C. ITEMPO: TO CAPTURE THE SACRIFICE MADE BY IA SAILORS WHO
COMPLETE MULTIPLE ROTATIONS, THE NAVY WILL TRACK SPECIFIC IA
ASSIGNMENT INFORMATION WITH THE ITEMPO SYSTEM.
D. SKILLSET CAPTURE: A SYSTEM TO CAPTURE THE "SKILLSETS AND
TRAINING" THAT OUR IA SAILORS RECEIVE DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF
THESE IMPORTANT MISSIONS IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT. THIS WILL ALLOW
NAVY TO BETTER DEFINE SKILL SETS FOR FUTURE GWOT APPLICATIONS.
SEPARATE NAVADMINS WILL PROVIDE FURTHER DETAIL.

6. IA BUSINESS RULES: THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS RULES ARE A
STARTING POINT FOR REWARDING THE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION OUR IAS
MAKE TO BOTH THE NAVY AND THE NATION.
A. RESPONSIBILITIES DURING THE IA PROCESS:
(1) BUSINESS RULE DEVELOPMENT: TFIA HAS ESTABLISHED THIS
INITIAL SET OF BUSINESS RULES AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FUTURE
NAVADMINS AND UPDATES TO IA BUSINESS RULES. MEMORANDUMS OF
UNDERSTANDING (MOUS) BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS WILL BE ESTABLISHED TO
MAKE THESE PROCESSES ENDURING.
(2) FLEET FORCES COMMAND (FFC): FFC WILL ASSUME THE
FUNCTION OF GLOBAL FORCE MANAGEMENT (GFM) FOR ALL IA FUNCTIONS
EARLY NEXT YEAR. IN THAT ROLE, THEY WILL RECOMMEND BEST ACTIVE
COMPONENT (AC)/RESERVE COMPONENT (RC) MIX, AND DIRECT ALLOCATION
OF REQUIREMENTS AMONG AC NAVY ENTERPRISES UTILIZING ESTABLISHED
BUSINESS RULES. FFC GFM WILL COORDINATE CLOSELY WITH ALL MAJOR
STAKEHOLDERS AND NAVAL RESERVE FORCES COMMAND (NRFC) TO ENSURE
MAXIMUM COMMONALITY BETWEEN AC AND RC IA PROCESSES AND BEST
PRACTICE INCORPORATION.
(3) OPNAV N3/N5: WILL COORDINATE WITH FFC GFM TO
CONDUCT
IA REQUIREMENTS AND DEMAND PLANNING REVIEWS AT LEAST QUARTERLY
TO ASSESS NAVY'S ABILITY TO MEET ANTICIPATED JOINT TASK FORCE
(JTF) AND REQUEST-FOR-FORCE (RFF) REQUIREMENTS FOR INDIVIDUALS.
WHEN THESE REVIEWS SHOW POTENTIAL REDLINE CHALLENGES, OPNAV N3/N5
AND FFC GFM WILL CONDUCT RISK ASSESSMENTS TO DETERMINE NAVY'S
ABILITY TO MEET REQUIREMENTS.
(4) PERS-46: WILL PRODUCE ALL IA ORDERS. WHEN FFC GFM
ASSUMES SOURCING RESPONSIBILITIES, FFC GFM WILL COORDINATE WITH
MAJOR STAKEHOLDERS (ENTERPRISES) AND PROVIDE REQUIRED INPUT FOR
ORDERS FOR AC SOURCED REQUIREMENTS AND NRFC WILL PROVIDE REQUIRED
INPUT FOR RC SOURCED REQUIREMENTS TO PERS-46 FOR THE PRODUCTION OF
ORDERS.
(5) NRFC: WILL REVIEW MANPOWER AVAILABILITY STATUS (MAS)
CODES TO DETERMINE IF EXISTING CODES ARE SUFFICIENT TO DEFINITIVELY
ESTABLISH RC CAPACITY.
B. SOURCING AND NOTIFICATION BUSINESS RULES:
(1) SEA DUTY CAPACITY: SEA DUTY CAPACITY IS THE NUMBER OF
SEA DUTY PERSONNEL ABOVE A RISK BASED REDLINE APPLIED BY UNIT
IDENTIFICATION CODE (UIC), SKILL SET, AND PAY BAND. REDLINES ARE
CURRENTLY SET AT 90% OF P9 BILLETS AUTHORIZED (BA). FFC GFM IN
COORDINATION WITH OPNAV N1 AND OPNAV N3/N5 CAN MODIFY REDLINES BY
COMMUNITY AND/OR UIC (AS REQUIRED OR APPROPRIATE TO CHANGE
CAPACITY). CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM CAPACITY ARE: TYPE 3 AND 4 SEA
DUTY; NUCLEAR TRAINED PERSONNEL ASSIGNED TO CVN, SSN, SSBN, SSGN;
AND SPECIAL WARFARE (SPECWAR) ASSIGNED TO USSOCOM. PERSONNEL
EXCLUDED FROM CAPACITY MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR ASSIGNMENT ON A
CASE-BY-CASE BASIS (SEE AC ASSIGNMENT RULES BELOW).
(2) SHORE DUTY CAPACITY: SHORE DUTY CAPACITY IS THE NUMBER
OF SHORE DUTY PERSONNEL ABOVE A RISK BASED REDLINE APPLIED BY UIC,
SKILL SET, AND PAY BAND. IN GENERAL REDLINES ARE CURRENTLY SET AT
75% OF P9 BA FOR UNITS MANNED BY MISSION, FUNCTIONS TASKS DOCUMENTS
AND 90% OF P9 BA FOR UNITS MANNED BY FLEET MANNING DOCUMENTS. FFC
GFM IN COORDINATION WITH OPNAV N1 AND OPNAV N3/N5 CAN MODIFY
REDLINES BY COMMUNITY AND/OR UIC (AS REQUIRED OR APPROPRIATE TO
CHANGE CAPACITY). CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM CAPACITY ARE: TYPE 6
OVERSEAS DUTY; JOINT DUTY; NON DISTRIBUTABLE MANNING (STUDENTS,
TRANSIENTS, TPPH); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (SECURITY, MAINTENANCE) BILLETS;
NUCLEAR PROPULSION CODED BILLETS (AVAILABLE FOR ASSIGNMENT WITH
N133 APPROVAL); AND A PORTION OF MANPOWER PERSONNEL TRAINING &
EDUCATION (MPT&E) READINESS BILLETS (E.G., CRITICAL INSTRUCTOR,
RECRUIT DIVISION COMMANDER BILLETS, AND PRODUCTION RECRUITERS).
PERSONNEL EXCLUDED FROM CAPACITY MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR ASSIGNMENT ON
A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS (SEE AC ASSIGNMENT RULES).
(3) RC CAPACITY: RC CAPACITY IS THE NUMBER OF RC PERSONNEL
AVAILABLE FOR MOBILIZATION PER CURRENT OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF
DEFENSE (OSD) AND SECRETARY OF THE NAVY (SECNAV) MOBILIZATION
POLICIES. PERSONNEL IN RC UNITS IDENTIFIED FOR UNIT LEVEL
MOBILIZATION ARE EXCLUDED FROM CAPACITY. FFC GFM WILL MAINTAIN A
LIST OF EXCLUDED UNITS; HIGH DEMAND/LOW DENSITY (HD/LD) SKILL SET
AREA COMMUNITY MANAGERS, WHERE NECESSARY, WILL PROPOSE TO NPC AND
FFC GFM COMMUNITY SPECIFIC BUSINESS RULES TO ESTABLISH RC
CAPACITY IN HD/LD SKILL SET AREAS (CURRENTLY SEABEE, NAVAL COASTAL
WARFARE (NCW), FLEET MARINE FORCE SUPPORT (FMF), NAVAL
EXPEDITIONARY LOGISTICS (NAVELSG), SPECWAR, BUREAU OF MEDICINE
(BUMED), CIVIL ENGINEERING CORPS (CEC), ENGINEERING DUTY (ED),
SUPPLY, INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS (IP), AND INTEL).
(4) AC SOURCING (ALLOCATION DETERMINATION): THE GOAL IS
TO BALANCE DISTRIBUTION OF AUGMENTATION REQUIREMENTS EQUITABLY,
NOT NECESSARILY EQUALLY, TO THE SOURCING NAVY ENTERPRISE.
(A) DISTRIBUTION OF REQUIREMENTS WILL BE PROPORTIONAL
TO THE ENTERPRISE COMPONENT OF THE NET CAPACITY (NET BALANCE).
REQUIREMENTS SHALL BE MANAGED BY PERS-46 AND FFC GFM THROUGH THE
ENTERPRISES. ENTERPRISES WILL MANAGE THEIR SUB-CLAIMANTS IN THE
SAME MANNER. A REBALANCING OF REQUIREMENTS IS REQUIRED DUE TO
AN IMBALANCE CREATED BY THE FORMER PRACTICE OF INVENTORY-BASED
DISTRIBUTION.
(B) PERS-463 WILL PROVIDE ENTERPRISES A LIST OF REFILL
REQUIREMENTS AFTER COMPLETION OF THE REBALANCING. REBALANCING
WILL LIKELY RESULT IN THE RE-TASKING OF SOME REFILL REQUIREMENTS
TO OTHER ENTERPRISES. REFILLS WILL GENERALLY BE TASKED TO THE SAME
ENTERPRISE AS THE ORIGINAL TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF ADVANCED
PLANNING.
(C) HD/LD COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT (CURRENTLY SEABEE, NCW,
FMF, NAVELSG, SPECWAR, BUMED, CEC, ED, SUPPLY, IP, AND INTEL) WILL
BE CONSULTED FOR DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR REQUIREMENTS TO APPLICABLE
ENTERPRISES.
(5) OPTIMIZE AC/RC MIX:
(A) FFC GFM AND OPNAV N3/N5 WILL REVIEW AVAILABLE AC AND
RC CAPACITY WHEN DETERMINING MIX CONSTRUCT. AC WILL NORMALLY BE
CONSIDERED FIRST. NATURE OF MISSION MAY SUGGEST RC DUE TO POTENTIAL
BENEFIT FROM CIVILIAN JOB EXPERIENCE; HOWEVER, INVOLUNTARY
MOBILIZATION CANNOT BE BASED STRICTLY ON CIVILIAN SKILL SETS.
(B) COMMUNITY MANAGERS MAY PROPOSE, WHEN APPROPRIATE,
UNIQUE AC/RC MIX BUSINESS RULES FOR APPROVAL BY MAJOR STAKEHOLDERS.
AC/RC MIX WILL SUPPORT SUSTAINMENT FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS FOR
DEPLOYABLE UNITS/PERSONNEL (THIS PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY TO GROW
CAPACITY
IF NECESSARY THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS).
(6) AC ASSIGNMENT BUSINESS RULES:
(A) PRD MANAGEMENT: IF REQUIRED, PRDS FOR PERSONNEL
SELECTED FOR AN IA TOUR WILL BE ADJUSTED TO THE END OF THE MONTH
FOLLOWING THE PROJECTED MONTH OF RETURN. PARENT COMMANDS WILL
INITIATE A PRD CHANGE REQUEST CITING THE REASON: PRD CHANGE
REQUIRED TO SUPPORT NAVY GWOT EFFORTS AS DIRECTED BY HIGHER
AUTHORITY.
(B) BACK TO BACK DEPLOYMENTS: IAS WILL BE AFFORDED
SIX MONTHS REPRIEVE BETWEEN DEPLOYMENTS (I.E., IF A MEMBER IS
SELECTED FROM A SEA UNIT, CARE MUST BE EXERCISED TO ENSURE THE
MEMBER DID NOT JUST RETURN FROM A DEPLOYMENT OR WILL RETURN FROM
THE IA ASSIGNMENT TO FACE AN IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT). WHEN IT
APPEARS THERE IS NO OTHER VIABLE ALTERNATIVE THAN TO SELECT A
MEMBER WHOSE GWOT DEPLOYMENT WOULD BE INSIDE OF SIX MONTHS PRIOR
TO OR FOLLOWING A UNIT DEPLOYMENT, THE CASE MAY BE REFERRED TO
THE ENTERPRISE AND OR COMMUNITY MANAGER FOR WAIVER CONSIDERATION.
(C) NOMINATION ACCEPTABILITY: E-1 OR E-2 SAILORS WILL
ONLY BE ACCEPTED FOR SERVICE IN A DEPLOYING NAVY UNIT. THE
ENTERPRISE IS FINAL SOURCING AUTHORITY DUE TO FLEET READINESS
ISSUES. ALL BY NAME CALLS, VOLUNTEERS, OR OTHER SELECTIONS WILL
BE REFERRED TO THE ENTERPRISE. IF A BY NAME FILL IS NOT AGREED
TO, THE ENTERPRISE WILL NOMINATE A REPLACEMENT. IF A MEMBER
SUBMITS A RETIREMENT REQUEST OR RESIGNATION FOLLOWING VERBAL
NOTIFICATION OF AN ASSIGNMENT BUT PRIOR TO ORDERS ISSUANCE, THE
CHAIN OF COMMAND SHOULD INDICATE THIS ACTION ON THE REQUEST.
(D) PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT: DETAILERS AND COMMUNITY
MANAGERS WILL REVIEW IA ASSIGNMENTS FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
CONCERNS ONCE ORDERS ARE WRITTEN. RETIREMENT REQUESTS WILL NOT
BE ACCEPTED THAT WOULD PRECLUDE COMPLETION OF THE ASSIGNMENT.
(E) NOTIFICATION TIME: IF IN DANGER OF BROACHING THE
30-DAY NOTIFICATION LIMIT, AT THE 35 DAY POINT NPC IN COORDINATION
WITH FFC GFM MAY ASSIGN THE BILLET TO AN INDIVIDUAL AND WILL GIVE
THE ENTERPRISE TWO BUSINESS DAYS TO ACCEPT OR PROPOSE AN
ALTERNATIVE. CHIEF OF NAVAL PERSONNEL WILL BE NOTIFIED OF ANY
NOTIFICATION LESS THAN 30 DAYS.
(F) VOLUNTEERS: ALL VOLUNTEERS FROM COMMANDS NOT
INCLUDED IN CAPACITY REQUIRE COMMAND ENDORSEMENT. NUCLEAR CODED
SHORE BILLETS REQUIRE OPNAV N133 CONCURRENCE PRIOR TO ASSIGNMENT.
(G) EXCLUSIONS: PERSONNEL WITHIN HD/LD SKILL SET UNITS
(CURRENTLY SEABEE, NCW, FMF, NAVELSG, SPECWAR, BUMED, CEC, ED,
SUPPLY, IP, AND INTEL) ARE EXCLUDED FROM ANY PETTY OFFICER/ANY
OFFICER ASSIGNMENTS.
(7) RC ASSIGNMENT BUSINESS RULES:
(A) PERSONNEL WITHIN HD/LD SKILL SET UNITS (CURRENTLY
SEABEE, NCW, FMF, NAVELSG, SPECWAR, BUMED, CEC, ED, SUPPLY, IP, AND
INTEL) ARE EXCLUDED FROM ANY PETTY OFFICER/ANY
OFFICER ASSIGNMENTS. PERSONNEL SERVING IN RESERVE UNITS IDENTIFIED
FOR IMMINENT MOBILIZATION ARE NOT ASSIGNABLE. FFC GFM WILL
MAINTAIN AND PUBLISH A LIST OF THESE UNITS.
(B) PERSONNEL WHO AFFILIATE WITH THE NAVY RESERVE WITHIN
6 MONTHS OF RELEASE FROM ACTIVE DUTY WILL RECEIVE A 24 MONTH
DEFERMENT FROM INVOLUNTARY MOBILIZATION, COMMENCING ON THE DATE THEY
AFFILIATE WITH THE NAVY RESERVE. SPECIFIC DETAILS WILL BE
PROMULGATED IN A FUTURE NAVADMIN.
(C) E-1 OR E-2 SAILORS WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTED FOR SERVICE
IN A DEPLOYING NAVY UNIT.
(8) TIMEFRAMES FOR FILLING IA REQUIREMENTS: THE STANDARD IS
60 DAYS NOTIFICATION AND TO MOVE DEMAND PLANNING FROM 120 TO 180
DAYS BEFORE THE PROJECTED FIRST REPORT DATE. (HOWEVER, OPERATIONAL
NEED MAY RESULT IN SOME SAILORS RECEIVING LESS THAN 60 DAYS
NOTIFICATION)
(A) SHIFTS OF COMPONENT: SHIFT OF COMPONENT SOURCE
(I.E., AC-TO-RC OR RC-TO-AC) WILL BE TREATED AS A REFILL (NOT A NEW
REQUIREMENT). EACH TIME A REQUIREMENT IS SOURCED, THE ASSIGNED
SOURCING COMPONENT (AC OR NRFC) DETERMINES IF THE BILLET SHOULD
SHIFT
FOR THE NEXT ROTATION. OPNAV N3/N5 WILL APPROVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
CHANGE OF COMPONENT AND COORDINATE FOR SOURCING WITH FFC GFM AND
NPC
FOR THE NEXT ROTATION. ENTERPRISE SOURCING PROCESS SHOULD ALLOW FOR
MAXIMUM TIME TO IDENTIFY RIGHT FIT FOR FILL WHILE MEETING
NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.
(B) EXISTING REQUIREMENTS (REFILLS): FROM THE TIME THE
ENTERPRISE RECEIVES TASKING TO REFILL AN EXISTING IA REQUIREMENT
THEY HAVE NO MORE THAN 30 DAYS TO PROVIDE THE NOMINEE TO FFC GFM.
(C) NEW REQUIREMENTS: FROM THE TIME THE ENTERPRISE
RECEIVES TASKING FOR A NEW IA REQUIREMENT, THEY HAVE NO MORE THAN 14
DAYS TO PROVIDE THE NOMINEE TO FFC GFM.
(D) EMERGENT REQUIREMENTS: EMERGENT REQUIREMENTS ARE
THOSE RECEIVED WHERE THE IA SELECTION PROCESS IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN
DELIVERY OF ORDERS TO THE SELECTED IA LESS THAN 30 DAYS PRIOR TO THE
FIRST INTERIM STOP REPORT DATE. PERS-46 IN COORDINATION WITH FFC GFM
WILL ASSIGN INDIVIDUALS AND NOTIFY THE APPLICABLE ENTERPRISE OF THE
SELECTIONS. THE ENTERPRISE MUST APPROVE OR NOMINATE A DIFFERENT IA
CANDIDATE WITHIN TWO BUSINESS DAYS OF SUCH A NOTIFICATION.
(9) CHANGES TO ORDERS: ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL RECEIVES ORDERS,
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THOSE ORDERS (GREATER THAN 30 DAY IMPACT ON
DEPARTURE FROM AND RETURN TO PARENT UNIT)WILL BE HANDLED AS FOLLOWS:
(A)IF A BILLET IS CANCELLED LESS THAN 30 DAYS FROM FIRST
INTERIM STOP, MEMBER WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO BE ASSIGNED TO ANOTHER
BILLET (PROVIDED ONE IS AVAILABLE WITHIN RANK AND SKILL-SET MATCH).
THE MEMBERS ENTERPRISE WILL IDENTIFY A NEW BILLET ASSIGNMENT,EITHER
WORKING FROM THE BILLETS THAT HAVE BEEN TASKED TO THE ENTERPRISE OR
BY
COORDINATING WITH NPC AND FFC GFM TO CHOOSE FROM ALL OPEN BILLETS.
(B) IF A BILLET IS CANCELLED GREATER THAN 30 DAYS FROM
FIRST INTERIM STOP, THE MEMBER WILL NOT HAVE THE OPTION TO SEEK
AUTOMATIC REASSIGNMENT BUT CAN VOLUNTEER FOR A FUTURE ASSIGNMENT
WITH A COMMAND ENDORSEMENT.
(C) INCREASES TO BILLET TOUR LENGTHS RESULTING FROM A
BILLET REVALIDATION WILL BE REFLECTED IN SUBSEQUENT ROTATIONS OF THE
BILLET. ASSIGNED IA TOUR COMPLETION DATES WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED,
EXCEPT WHEN THE EXTENSION IS DIRECTED BY SECDEF. ENTERPRISES WILL
KEEP THE IAS PARENT COMMAND APPRAISED OF ALL ORDER MODIFICATIONS.
(10) PREPARING ALTERNATE IAS: NON-EMBEDDED ALTERNATE IAS DO
NOT RECEIVE TRAINING IN PARALLEL WITH PRIMARY IAS. EMBEDDED
ALTERNATE IAS DO RECEIVE TRAINING IN PARALLEL WITH PRIMARY IAS.
(A) NON-EMBEDDED ALTERNATE IA: ALTERNATES ARE NOT
REQUIRED FOR 0-5/0-6 IAS. EACH ENTERPRISE WILL MAINTAIN A LISTING
OF ALTERNATE IAS. ALTERNATE IAS SHOULD BE FULLY SCREENED AND
PREPARED TO DEPLOY WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE ORDERS NOTIFICATION DATE.
ALTERNATE IAS WILL BE KEPT ON A TETHER BY THE ENTERPRISE UNTIL
AFTER THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE PRIMARY IA. PRIMARY IA ASSIGNMENT
NOTIFICATION IS VIA OFFICIAL ORDERS. ALTERNATE IA TETHERING
NOTIFICATION IS VIA EMAIL/MESSAGE TO CHAIN OF COMMAND. THIS
NOTIFICATION WILL INCLUDE THE EXPECTED DATE OF TERMINATION OF
TETHERING STATUS. PRIMARY IAS AND TETHERED ALTERNATE IAS WILL
RECEIVE IDENTICAL SAILOR AND FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES. TETHERED
ALTERNATE IAS WILL BE CAUTIONED AGAINST TAKING IRREVERSIBLE ACTIONS
BEFORE RECEIPT OF ORDERS (E.G., SELLING HOME, TERMINATING LEASE).
AFTER THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE PRIMARY IA, THE ALTERNATE IA WILL
NO
LONGER BE TETHERED AND WILL BE OFFICIALLY NOTIFIED OF THEIR NEW
STATUS VIA EMAIL/MESSAGE TO THE CHAIN OF COMMAND. ADDITIONALLY, THEY
WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE ASSIGNMENT. IF A PRIMARY IA
FALLS-OUT PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT, NPC WILL COORDINATE WITH FFC GFM TO
NOTIFY THE APPROPRIATE ENTERPRISE AND SOURCE THE REQUIREMENT WITH
THE TETHERED ALTERNATE IA. THE ENTERPRISE WILL NOTIFY THE TETHERED
ALTERNATE IA VIA EMAIL/MESSAGE TO THE CHAIN OF COMMAND ADVISING OF
IMPENDING ORDERS.
(B) EMBEDDED ALTERNATE IA: IN SOME CASES (NORMALLY FOR
IN LIEU OF FORCES(ILO)), ALTERNATE IAS MAY BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE
EN ROUTE TRAINING IN PARALLEL WITH PRIMARY IAS TO MITIGATE THE
EFFECT OF LOSSES OF PRIMARY IAS PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT. FFC GFM WILL
DETERMINE AN ALTERNATE IA PLANNING FACTOR BASED ON HISTORIC FALL-
OUT DATA. THE REQUIREMENT FOR ALTERNATE IAS FOR ILO FORCES
SHALL
BE IDENTIFIED IN THE TASKING ORDER. ALL EMBEDDED ALTERNATE IAS
WILL BE FROM THE AC. PRIMARY AND ALTERNATE IAS WILL ATTEND TRAINING
TOGETHER AND RECEIVE IDENTICAL SAILOR AND FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES.
PRIMARY IA FALLOUTS DURING THE TRAINING TRACK WILL BE REPLACED BY
EMBEDDED ALTERNATE IAS. ALTERNATE IAS WILL RETURN TO PARENT COMMAND
FOLLOWING TRAINING AND WILL BE FENCED FROM FUTURE IA ASSIGNMENT
UNTIL
ROTATION IS COMPLETE. EMBEDDED ALTERNATE IAS WILL BE USED TO FILL
IN-THEATER ATTRITION.
(11) VOLUNTEER IA BUSINESS RULES: RULES ARE ESTABLISHED TO
ALLOW MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION BY INDIVIDUALS WANTING TO VOLUNTEER FOR
IA ASSIGNMENT. VOLUNTEERS ARE PERSONNEL THAT REQUEST ASSIGNMENT AS
AN AUGMENTEE EITHER VIA THE NPC WEBSITE OR IN RESPONSE TO A CALL
FOR VOLUNTEERS MESSAGE PRIOR TO THE FILL BEING ASSIGNED TO THEIR
COMMAND. VOLUNTEERS REQUIRE COMMAND ENDORSEMENT.
(A) NON-MISSION SPECIFIC VOLUNTEERS: VOLUNTEER VIA A
WEB APPLICATION AVAILABLE AT NAVY KNOWLEDGE ONLINE
(WWW.NKO.NAVY.MIL). VOLUNTEERING FOR NON-MISSION SPECIFIC
ASSIGNMENTS IS LIMITED TO A DEFINED TIME PERIOD AND REQUIRES COMMAND
ENDORSEMENT. THE DATABASE OF NON-MISSION SPECIFIC VOLUNTEERS WILL
BE JOINTLY MAINTAINED BY NPC AND NRFC. VOLUNTEERS CAN REMOVE THEIR
NAME FROM THE NON-MISSION SPECIFIC LIST VIA A REQUEST SUBMITTED
THROUGH THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.
(B) MISSION SPECIFIC VOLUNTEERS: VOLUNTEERS FOR MISSION
SPECIFIC ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE IDENTIFIED VIA AN ENTERPRISE
GENERATED STANDARD CALL FOR VOLUNTEERS MESSAGE WHEN REQUIREMENTS
ARE LEVIED.
(C) HD/LD COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS: PERSONNEL FROM HD/LD
COMMUNITIES WILL NOT BE USED FOR IAS OUTSIDE OF THEIR HIGH DEMAND
SKILL SET REGARDLESS OF VOLUNTEER STATUS. FFC GFM IN COORDINATION
WITH NPC WILL DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN AGREED UPON HD/LD COMMUNITY SKILL
LISTS.

7. I WANT TO ENSURE EVERY SAILOR THAT IA DUTY IS VALUED BY OUR NAVY
AND ENHANCES CAREERS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE ACTIONS TO ENSURE
THE SELECTION PROCESS FOR PERFORMING THESE MISSIONS IS FAIR AND THAT
THOSE SAILORS WHO COMPLETE THESE MISSIONS WILL BE PROPERLY
REWARDED. AS WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE IA MISSION OVER THE LONG
TERM,
POSITIVELY DEMONSTRATING THE VALUE NAVY PLACES ON PERFORMING IA
DUTY IS CRITICAL. I BELIEVE WE ARE ON THE RIGHT PATH TO BALANCE
BOTH OUR REQUIREMENT TO SUPPORT THE GWOT AND OUR REQUIREMENT TO
TAKE CARE OF OUR SAILORS. IT TAKES A GREAT TEAM EFFORT TO ACHIEVE
THIS BALANCE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OF OUR WORK - THIS
INITIATIVE IS TRULY A TEAM EFFORT.
