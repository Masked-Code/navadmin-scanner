INTERMEDIATE LEVEL PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION THROUGH A SET OF 
THREE SEMINARS:  STRATEGY AND WAR (S AND W), NATIONAL SECURITY DECISION 
MAKING (NSDM), AND JOINT MARITIME OPERATIONS (JMO). 
IT IS AVAILABLE TO OFFICERS, SELECTED COMMAND MASTER CHIEFS (CMDCMS), 
AND SELECTED DEFENSE DEPARTMENT CIVILIANS.  THERE IS NO TUITION FEE, 
AND COURSE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED ON A LOAN BASIS.
2.  FLEET SEMINAR PROGRAM COURSES ARE SIMILAR IN CONTENT AND 
METHODOLOGY TO THE PROGRAM OF STUDY OFFERED BY THE RESIDENT COLLEGE OF 
NAVAL COMMAND AND STAFF PROGRAM IN NEWPORT, RI.  SEMINARS FOR EACH 
COURSE MEET ONE EVENING PER WEEK FOR APPROXIMATELY 35 WEEKS, COMMENCING 
IN EARLY SEPTEMBER AND ENDING IN MAY.  LED BY NWC ADJUNCT FACULTY 
MEMBERS, AND SUPPORTED BY VISITING NWC FACULTY, THESE COURSES REPLICATE 
TO A SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE, BOTH THE CONTENT AND ATMOSPHERE OF THE 
RESIDENT COURSE OF STUDY.  SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF ALL THREE COURSES 
RESULTS IN THE AWARD OF A COLLEGE OF NAVAL COMMAND AND STAFF DIPLOMA AS 
WELL AS CREDIT FOR JOINT PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION PHASE I.

IT IS POSSIBLE FOR AN OFFICER WHO IS TRANSFERRING OR ASSIGNED TAD TO
