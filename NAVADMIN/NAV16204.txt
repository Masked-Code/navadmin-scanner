RMKS/1.  As U.S citizens, voting is one of our most fundamental rights.  In 
November, our Nation will elect our next President, Vice President, and many 
other Federal and local officials.  I strongly encourage you to take an 
active role in deciding our next elected leaders.

2.  Please take time to ensure that your voice is heard.  All eligible 
voters, working abroad or away from their home state, may complete voter 
registration or request an absentee ballot through www.fvap.gov.  For more 
information about voter registration, casting an absentee ballot, and mailing 
deadlines, contact your local voting assistance office or chain of command.

3.  DoD will offer special mail service with a tracking number through your 
overseas Military Post Office for each general election ballot cast 1 
September through 30 November 2016 (Reference A).  This service is free of 
charge to the voter.  To receive your tracking number, you must present your 
ballot to the customer service representative at your afloat or ashore 
Military Post Office.  Once you drop off your ballot it can be tracked to 
your local election office using the assigned tracking number at 
www.usps.com.

4.  To vote from CONUS locations, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and U.S. Territories, 
simply complete the absentee ballot and mail from any U.S. Post Office.
