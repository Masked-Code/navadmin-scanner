RMKS/1. This NAVADMIN announces the establishment of the Maritime Cyber 
Warfare Officer (MCWO) designator (188X) within the Information Warfare (IW) 
Community. 
 
2. MCWO establishment is a major milestone in building out the Navy Cyber 
Community. MCWOs are experts in cyberspace operations focused on both 
Offensive Cyberspace operations (OCO) and Defensive Cyberspace operations 
(DCO). MCWOs will conduct repeat operational and leadership tours within the 
Cyber Operation Force (COF) and Cyber Mission Force (CMF), including tours on 
National Mission Teams, Cyber Mission Teams, Cyber Protection Teams, and 
Cyber Support Teams. MCWOs will have the opportunity to conduct 
exploitation analyst and integrated on net (ION) training as well as serve as 
team leaders, planners, and operations officers. Control Grade MCWOs will 
have opportunities for O5 command and major command, as well as senior staff 
positions at Fleet Cyber Command, Commander Tenth Fleet, Joint Force Head 
Quarters Cyber, Cyber Mission Force Pacific, and US Cyber Command. 
 
3. The Active Component (AC) MCWO/1880 community is conducting an initial 
selection panel outside of the lateral transfer/redesignation board process 
for the initial conversion to MCWO. Applications for redesignation into the 
MCWO Community are now welcome for the next 90 days. Information Warfare 
Officer (IWO) qualified line officers with documented cyber focused 
education/training are eligible to apply. Officers currently serving-in or 
having completed a tour within the CMF are preferred. 
All applications must have the concurrence of the current (losing) community 
manager and detailer to ensure their eligibility for redesignation. 
Application package requirements are outlined in paragraph 4 of reference 
(a), which begin with the application being submitted to the current (losing) 
community manager via the commanding officer of the applicant. Completed 
applications should then be submitted via e-mail to Ms. Jana Rittman, 
Assistant IW Community Manager at BUPERS-31_IWC_FCT@NAVY.MIL no later than 90 
days following the date of this NAVADMIN. Additionally, applicants can 
receive the most up-to-date guidance on the application process on the MCWO

of MCWO accessions has been approved.

communities beginning with the February 2024 lateral transfer and 
redesignation board. Information on that process is available
