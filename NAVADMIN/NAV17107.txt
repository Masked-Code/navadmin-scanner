REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/15AUG16//
AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1500.78, FLEET SCHOLARS EDUCATION PROGRAM.//

RMKS/1.  Pursuant to reference (a), this NAVADMIN announces the fiscal year 
2018, academic year (AY) 2018 and 2019 Fleet Scholars Education Program 
(FSEP).  FSEP is a Navy talent management initiative that provides education 
opportunities to community-selected unrestricted line (URL) and Information 
Warfare Community (IWC) officers.  While in a full-time status, FSEP 
selectees will attend an accredited graduate school of their choice in 
residence (CONUS, Alaska and Hawaii) for up to 24 months.  Distance learning, 
executive master of business administration, medical and legal education are 
not authorized under this program.

2.  Community sponsors will develop and implement selection criteria and 
policies to identify their most talented and proven performers for FSEP 
participation.  Community sponsors will make selections no later than 31 
October 2017 and submit to Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Manpower, 
Personnel, Training and Education)(N1) in order to meet AY 18-19 fall/winter 
start dates.  FSEP is nominally focused on lieutenant URL and IWC officers.  
Each community sponsor may select up to their annual allocated graduate 
education opportunities shown below:

Community Designator                       Opportunities
AIRFOR    1310, 1320                       (7)
SURFOR    1110                             (9)
SUBFOR    1120                             (5)
NSWC      1130                             (3)
NECC      1140                             (3)
IWC       1810, 1820, 1830                 (3)

3.  Officers who have already received fully funded graduate education are 
not eligible to participate.  This does not include graduate degrees obtained 
through Post 9-11 G.I. Bill, tuition assistance or Navy College Program for 
Afloat College Education. Selectees will be assigned a unique additional 
qualification designation for purposes of tracking and career management.

4.  Upon notification of selection by the cognizant community leadership, 
FSEP selectees should apply to at least three graduate education institutions 
of their choice.  Participants will be reimbursed for up to three application 
and transcript fees. Participants shall consult the list of schools that 
already have education service agreements (ESA) on the Naval Postgraduate 
School Civilian Institutions (NPS CIVINS) webpage.  In cases where the school 
of choice is not on the ESA listing, the selectee must notify the NPS CIVINS 
office as soon as possible to allow sufficient time to pursue additional 
ESAs.  Participants are responsible for researching and completing 
prerequisites including graduate record examinations where applicable.  
Starting enrollment and permanent change of station orders will be for the 
fall/winter term start of AY 18-19.

5.  FSEP selectees shall agree to remain on active duty for 3 years following 
graduation or withdrawal from the program.  A member who voluntarily or 
through misconduct fails to complete the active-duty time agreed upon shall 
be required to reimburse the cost of the education received, prorated for the 
obligated time served.

6.  Additional information regarding the FSEP program can be found on the 
Navy CIVINS website at http://www.nps.edu/academics/CIVINS/index.html.  
Further questions can be addressed to point of contact, Ms. Yonna Diggs, 
N127, who can be reached at:  (703) 604-2608/DSN 664 or via e-mail at: 
yonna.diggs(at)navy.mil.

7.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or 31 January 2018, 
whichever occurs first.
