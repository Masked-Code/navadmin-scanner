2.  THE NAVY S EVOLVING HUMAN CAPITAL STRATEGY RECOGNIZES THAT
ADVANCED EDUCATION AND LIFE LONG LEARNING UNDERPIN SEA WARRIOR BY
DEVELOPING SAILORS WITH CRITICAL THINKING AND DECISION-MAKING
SKILLS, AND ENHANCE JOB PERFORMANCE BY IMPROVING UPON BASIC
COMMUNICATION, MATH, AND SCIENCE SKILLS.  AS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT
OF THE PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION CONTINUUM ESTABLISHED IN
NAVADMIN 263/04 AND IN SUPPORT OF THE NAVY'S RESPONSIBILITY TO
ENSURE SAILORS ARE ADEQUATELY EQUIPPED FOR THE CHALLENGES OF THE
FUTURE, A RATING RELEVANT ASSOCIATES DEGREE IS NOW A REQUIREMENT TO
BE ELIGIBLE FOR ADVANCEMENT TO SENIOR CHIEF PETTY OFFICER COMMENCING
WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011 SELECTION BOARDS (WHICH ARE CONVENED IN FISCAL

VALIDATED.
3.  AS THE NAVY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP HIGHLY TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES
AND RESHAPE THE WORKFORCE, SAILORS WILL BE CALLED UPON TO PERFORM IN
NEW AND CHALLENGING WAYS.  ADAPTING TO THESE CHALLENGES REQUIRES
LEADERS TO HAVE A STRONG EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION BOTH PROFESSIONALLY



PAGE 03 RUEWMFU8040 UNCLAS
AND PERSONALLY.  DEGREE PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON RATING RELEVANT
EDUCATION WILL IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND BETTER PREPARE THE SENIOR
ENLISTED LEADERSHIP FOR THESE CHALLENGES IN THE OPERATIONAL
ENVIRONMENT.  RATING RELEVANT DEGREES CAPITALIZE ON EXISTING
MILITARY TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE THAT, WHEN COMBINED WITH COLLEGE
LEVEL EXAMS AND COLLEGE COURSE WORK, WILL ENABLE SAILORS TO BETTER
PERFORM THE CRITICAL TASKS OF THE 21ST CENTURY NAVY.
4.  RECOGNIZING THAT SOME SAILORS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO PURSUE THEIR
EDUCATIONAL GOALS, THE FOLLOWING GRANDFATHER PROVISIONS SATISFY THE

PAGE 05 RUEWMFU8040 UNCLAS
DESIGNATED BY THE NAVY FOR ADVANCEMENT ELIGIBILITY AND ARE OFFERED
BY THE NAVY COLLEGE PROGRAM DISTANCE LEARNING PARTNERSHIPS (NCPDLP).
ALL PARTNERSHIP INSTITUTIONS ARE MEMBERS OF SERVICEMEMBERS
OPPORTUNITY COLLEGE (SOC) AND OFFER SIGNIFICANT DEGREE COMPLETION
FLEXIBILITY.  NCPDLP DEGREES MAXIMIZE ACCEPTANCE OF AMERICAN COUNCIL
ON EDUCATION (ACE) RECOMMENDED CREDIT FOR NAVY TRAINING AND
EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS CREDIT BY EXAMINATION AND THE INSTITUTIONS ALL
OFFER DISTANCE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES TO COMPLETE THE REMAINDER OF
DEGREE REQUIREMENTS.  SAILORS MAY ELECT TO ENROLL WITH ANY
INSTITUTION THAT OFFERS EQUIVALENT DEGREES/SPECIALIZATIONS AND HAS
ACCREDITATION RECOGNIZED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.  NAVY
COLLEGE OFFICES WILL ASSIST SAILORS IN IDENTIFYING EQUIVALENT
RATING RELEVANT DEGREE OPTIONS.
7.  NAVY KNOWLEDGE ONLINE (NKO), WWW.NKO.NAVY.MIL OR SIPRNET
WWW.NKO.NAVY.SMIL.MIL, PROVIDES THE STEPS SAILORS MUST FOLLOW IN
PREPARATION TO MEET THE EDUCATION REQUIREMENT FOR ADVANCEMENT
ELIGIBILITY.  IN NKO, THESE ROADMAP STEPS CAN BE ACCESSED VIA THE
MAIN "LEARNING" CATEGORY HEADER.  THE EDUCATION DEGREE ROADMAP WILL
BE DISPLAYED FOR SAILORS TO REFERENCE.  QUICK LINKS ARE ALSO
PROVIDED FOR SAILORS TO ACCESS AND VIEW THEIR INDIVIDUAL ELECTRONIC

TRAINING JACKET.  LISTS OF RATING RELEVANT DEGREE OPTIONS (SORTED BY
COLLEGE INSTITUTION AND BY SPECIFIC RATING), CLEP PRACTICE EXAMS,
AND SMART TRANSCRIPTS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE LEARNING PAGE.  IN
PARTICULAR SAILORS SHALL:
    A.  VALIDATE EDUCATION RECORDS.  SAILORS MUST FIRST ASSESS THEIR
ACADEMIC RECORDS AND TRANSCRIPTS AS DISPLAYED IN THEIR ELECTRONIC
TRAINING JACKET (ETJ).  THE ETJ CONTAINS DATA TAKEN FROM
SAILOR/MARINE AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATION REGISTRY TRANSCRIPT
(SMART).  DIRECTIONS FOR CORRECTING DISCREPANCIES IN THE ETJ ARE
CONTAINED IN THE ROADMAP.
    B.  OF SPECIFIC NOTE, NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND AND NAVAL EDUCATION
AND TRAINING COMMAND HAVE COLLABORATED TO PROVIDE ONE-STOP SHOPPING
FOR ENLISTED EDUCATION RECORD UPDATE THROUGH THE NAVY COLLEGE
CENTER.  USING THE PROCESS DETAILED ABOVE TO UPDATE THE ETJ WILL NOW
ALSO UPDATE AN ENLISTED SAILORS RECORD IN THE ENLISTED MASTER FILE
  
UNCLAS FINAL SECTION OF 2
SUBJ: SENIOR ENLISTED EDUCATION INITIATIVE-ASSOCIATES
(EMF).  THE NAVY COLLEGE CENTER WILL ALSO FORWARD AN ENLISTED
SAILOR'S TRANSCRIPT AUTOMATICALLY TO THE BUREAU OF NAVAL PERSONNEL
FOR ENTRY INTO THE ELECTRONIC MILITARY PERSONNEL RECORDS SYSTEM
(EMPRS).  PERSONNEL SUPPORT DETACHMENTS AND LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE
OFFICES WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO UPDATE EDUCATION
INFORMATION IN THE NAVY STANDARD INTEGRATED PERSONNEL SYSTEM
(NSIPS).  SAILORS SHOULD, THOUGH, CONTINUE TO ENSURE LOCALLY THAT
THEIR EDUCATION INFORMATION IS UPDATED ON THEIR NAVPERS 1070/604
(PAGE 4).
    C.  PURSUE ACADEMIC ASSESSMENT.  SAILORS STARTING A DEGREE
SHOULD SEEK ACADEMIC ADVICE PRIOR TO SELECTING A SUITABLE
RATING RELEVANT DEGREE PROGRAM.  THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT SOURCES

    D.  COMPLETE ACADEMIC TESTING:  TESTING IS AN ADVANTAGEOUS WAY
TO TRANSLATE KNOWLEDGE GAINED THROUGH LIFE, PROFESSIONAL, AND
MILITARY EXPERIENCE INTO COLLEGE ACADEMIC CREDIT, WHICH WILL
ACCELERATE DEGREE COMPLETION AND PRESERVE TUITION ASSISTANCE
BENEFITS FOR COURSES NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH TESTING PROGRAMS.  ALL
SAILORS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR EDUCATION PLANS, ARE NOW REQUIRED TO
PURSUE CREDIT THROUGH COLLEGE LEVEL EXAMINATION PROGRAM (CLEP) AND
DEFENSE ACTIVITY FOR NON-TRADITIONAL EDUCATION SUPPORT (DANTES)



PAGE 03 RUEWMFU8041 UNCLAS
STANDARDIZED SUBJECT TESTS (DSST), WHERE APPLICABLE, BEFORE
RECEIVING COMMAND AUTHORIZATION FOR TUITION ASSISTANCE.
        (1) TO HELP ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS, SAILORS MUST
COMPLETE APPLICABLE PRACTICE CLEP/DSST EXAMS, WHICH EXIST FOR SELECT
COURSES AND ARE AVAILABLE VIA NKO AND THE LOCAL NAVY COLLEGE OFFICE.
PRACTICE EXAMS ARE DESIGNED TO FAMILIARIZE SAILORS WITH ACTUAL
CLEP/DSST EXAM MATERIAL.  TESTS ARE TIMED AND WILL PROVIDE A MEASURE
OF WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL STANDS ACADEMICALLY AND HELP IDENTIFY AREAS
THAT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PREPARATION.
        (2) SAILORS WHO SCORE WELL ON PRACTICE EXAMS SHOULD TAKE THE
ACTUAL CLEP/DSST EXAMS FOR ACADEMIC CREDIT AS SOON AS PRACTICAL.
TESTING PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE LOCAL NAVY COLLEGE
OFFICES, RESERVE CENTERS, NATIONAL TEST CENTERS, AND ONBOARD SOME
LARGE DECK SHIPS.  TESTING OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE EXPANDED TO MOST
SHIPS IN CY06.  ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES FOR SHIPBOARD TESTING WILL BE
PROVIDED BY SEPARATE CORRESPONDENCE.
    E.  UPDATE ETJ:  SAILORS SHOULD VALIDATE AND UPDATE THEIR
ACADEMIC RECORDS NOW AND ANNUALLY, THEREAFTER, TO ENSURE
EXAM/COURSE/DEGREE COMPLETIONS ARE RECORDED PROPERLY.  SEE PARAGRAPH
7A FOR INSTRUCTIONS.



PAGE 04 RUEWMFU8041 UNCLAS
8.  WITH THE FOUR-YEAR LEAD TIME, IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO IMMEDIATELY
ENROLL IN COLLEGE COURSES.  SAILORS HAVE ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO
DEVELOP AND COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION PLANS TO MEET CAREER GOALS.
ANALYSIS HAS SHOWN THAT SAILORS IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WHO HAVE
LIMITED CREDIT FOR MILITARY TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE AND HAVE TAKEN
NO COLLEGE COURSES TO DATE, WOULD NEED TO TAKE A MAXIMUM OF 12
SEMESTER HOURS PER YEAR TO COMPLETE A RATING RELEVANT ASSOCIATES
DEGREE.  HOWEVER, BY FOLLOWING THE MANDATORY TESTING PROCEDURES IN
PARA 7C1 AND 7C2, SAILORS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THIS NUMBER OF
SEMESTER HOURS PER YEAR.
9.  FOR SAILORS AT-SEA OR FORWARD DEPLOYED, WE UNDERSTAND THAT
CLASSROOM AND DISTANCE SUPPORT OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET THIS
EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENT ARE SOMETIMES LIMITED.  TO ASSIST THOSE
SAILORS, A TOOL IS BEING DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY AND TRACK ACADEMIC
PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR SENIOR CHIEF PETTY
OFFICER FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2011 SELECTION BOARD.  NAVAL EDUCATION
AND TRAINING CENTER PLANS TO INDIVIDUALLY TRACK SAILORS THAT FALL
INTO THIS CATEGORY AND WILL WORK WITH THEIR COMMAND TO ENSURE THEY
HAVE ALL THE TOOLS AND CONTENT REQUIRED TO MEET SUBJECT REQUIREMENTS.
10.  TUITION ASSISTANCE FUNDING WILL REMAIN AVAILABLE TO SAILORS TO



PAGE 05 RUEWMFU8041 UNCLAS
PURSUE WHATEVER EDUCATIONAL COURSES OR DEGREES THEY DESIRE TO PURSUE
IN NON-RATING RELEVANT DEGREES.  THIS NAVADMIN ONLY ADDRESSES
SPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR ADVANCEMENT TO
SENIOR CHIEF PETTY OFFICER.
11.  THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN WHAT WILL BE THE NAVY'S EVOLVING
JOURNEY ON THE ROAD TOWARD A CULTURE OF PROFESSIONAL MILITARY
EDUCATION.  FURTHER EFFORTS WILL SEEK OUT OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND
AND GROW THE VARIETY AND SCOPE OF RELEVANT DEGREE PROGRAMS AND
METHODS OF ACHIEVING ACADEMIC SUCCESS, RESULTING IN A GREATER APPEAL
TO THE PERSONAL INTEREST OF SAILORS AND INCREASED CAPABILITY IN
PERFORMANCE OF THE NAVY'S MISSION.
12.  COMMANDING OFFICERS AND SENIOR ENLISTED LEADERS ARE ENCOURAGED
TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO SAILORS IN PLANNING FOR TIMELY MEETING OF
CAREER GOALS.  TO ASSIST IN THIS EFFORT, ORIENTATION SERVICES ARE
AVAILABLE FROM THE LOCAL NAVY COLLEGE OFFICE FOR PRE-DEPLOYMENT
EDUCATIONAL PLANNING.  THIS SERVICE WILL PROVIDE AN ASSESSMENT OF
CREW EDUCATION LEVELS AND ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMAND
EDUCATION PLAN.  IN ADDITION, EDUCATIONAL DATA THAT PLACES AN
EMPHASIS ON SAILORS WHO ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR SENIOR
CHIEF PETTY OFFICER FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2011 SELECTION BOARD WILL BE



PAGE 06 RUEWMFU8041 UNCLAS
PROVIDED.  THIS DETAILED INFORMATION WILL INCLUDE CREDITS ALREADY
EARNED THROUGH MILITARY TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE, CREDIT THROUGH
EXAMINATION AND COMPLETED COLLEGE COURSES.  THIS SERVICE WILL
PROVIDE SENIOR COMMAND LEADERSHIP WITH THE TRACKING TOOLS NEEDED TO
PROMOTE THIS REQUIREMENT.
