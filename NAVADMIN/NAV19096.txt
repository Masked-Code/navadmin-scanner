SUBJ/ACADEMIC YEAR 2019-2020 NAVAL WAR COLLEGE FLEET SEMINAR PROGRAM//

MSGID/GENADMIN/CNO WASHINGTON DC/N1/APR//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Naval War College (NWC) Fleet Seminar 
Program (FSP) which offers intermediate level Joint Professional Military 
Education (JPME-I) through a set of three courses:  Strategy and War (S and 
W), Theater Security Decision Making (TSDM), and Joint Maritime Operations 
(JMO), offered at multiple locations. Each course normally requires one 
academic year to complete, which runs from September through the following 
May.
All three courses are not offered simultaneously at all locations.
There is no tuition fee and course materials are provided on a loan basis at 
no cost to students.

2.  The NWC FSP will be offered in 19 regional locations in the United States 
for academic year 2019-2020.  Planned locations and courses are:

    a.  Annapolis, MD (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
    b.  Dahlgren, VA (TSDM)
    c.  Everett, WA (TSDM)
    d.  Fort Worth, TX (TSDM)
    e.  Great Lakes, IL (JMO)
    f.  Jacksonville, FL (TSDM and JMO)
    g.  Kitsap, WA (JMO)
    h.  Mayport, FL (S and W)
    i.  Millington, TN (JMO)
    j.  New Orleans, LA (TSDM)
    k.  Newport, RI (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
    l.  Norfolk, VA (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
    m.  Patuxent River, MD (JMO)

    q.  San Diego, CA (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
    r.  Washington, DC (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
    s.  Whidbey Island, WA (S&W)

3.  FSP courses are similar in content and delivery methodology to the 
intermediate level program of study offered by the resident College of Naval 
Command and Staff in Newport, RI.  Seminars for each course meet once a week 
in the evening for approximately 34 weeks, commencing in early September 2019 
and ending in May 2020.
Successful completion of all three courses results in the award of a College 
of Naval Command and Staff diploma, as well as credit for JPME-I.  The FSP 
seminars at all locations are conducted in-step each week so it is possible 
for a student who is transferring to or assigned temporary additional duty at 
another seminar location to attend class at that location.

4.  NWC accepts program applications from commissioned officers (active and 
reserve) and civilian employees of the federal government, subject to the 
following eligibility requirements
    a.  Members of the sea services (Navy, Marine Corps and Coast
Guard) in the pay grade of O-3 or above, while officers from the other
