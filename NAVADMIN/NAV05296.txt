DUTY AND FORMER MILITARY MEMBERS DEDICATED TO THE GOAL OF ENHANCING
PROFESSIONALISM IN THE SURFACE NAVY.  THE SNA ANNUAL NATIONAL
SYMPOSIUM PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ARMED FORCES-WIDE
DISCUSSIONS ON A BROAD RANGE OF PROFESSIONAL AND CAREER ISSUES OF

IS A FORUM WHERE MEMBERS CAN ADDRESS AND WORK TOWARDS INNOVATIVE
SOLUTIONS TO TODAY'S ISSUES AND TOMORROW'S SURFACE WARFARE
CHALLENGES.
3.  PER REFS A AND B, COMMANDING OFFICERS MAY ISSUE ORDERS FOR
ATTENDANCE AT GOVERNMENT EXPENSE AFTER DETERMINING THAT THE

ACHIEVED.  COMMANDING OFFICERS ARE DIRECTED TO FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE
IN REFS A AND B WHEN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION.  GOVERNMENT EXPENSE
