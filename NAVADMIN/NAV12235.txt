SUBJ/COAST GUARD BIRTHDAY MESSAGE//

RMKS/1.  ON BEHALF OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY, I  EXTEND 
MY CONGRATULATIONS AND THANKS TO ALL COAST GUARDSMEN AND  THEIR FAMILIES ON 
THE OCCASION OF THE 222ND BIRTHDAY OF THE UNITED  STATES COAST GUARD ON 4 
AUGUST 2012.

2.  FROM THE FIRST 10 VESSELS OF THE REVENUE CUTTER SERVICE IN 1790  AND THE 
IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE COAST GUARD IN THE WAR OF 1812, TO A  BROAD ARRAY OF 
VITAL OPERATIONS TODAY, THE COAST GUARD HAS BEEN AN  INSTRUMENTAL PARTNER OF 
THE UNITED STATES NAVY AS WE SAFEGUARD  FREEDOM OF THE WATERWAYS TOGETHER.  
THE MARITIME WARFIGHTING CAPABILITIES OF THE NAVY-COAST GUARD TEAM ARE THE 
MOST ADVANCED AND SOPHISTICATED IN THE WORLD.  TOGETHER, AS WE SAIL INTO THE 
UNCERTAIN WATERS OF THE FUTURE, OUR ROLES WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT 
TO NATIONAL SECURITY AND PROVIDE THE PRESIDENT WITH A DOMINANT OFFSHORE 
OPTION.

3.  FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS OF OUR NATION, OUR SERVICES HAVE SHARED A RICH, 
COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP.  TODAY, AS EVER, WE FACE SIMILAR CHALLENGES 
TOGETHER.  FISCAL AND SEA-BORNE THREATS TO OUR NATION  CONTINUE TO PERSIST AND 
GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGES ARE PRESENTING NEW  POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE 
ARCTIC, AN AREA OF INCREASING  INTEREST TO OUR MARITIME SERVICES.  AS 
CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES  CONTINUE TO GROW IN THE FUTURE, WE ARE PROUD TO 
SAIL ALONGSIDE AN  ADAPTABLE, RESPONSIVE FORCE OF MARITIME PROFESSIONALS IN 
PROTECTING  OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS AT SEA.

4.  AS YOU CELEBRATE ANOTHER YEAR OF SAVING LIVES, PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT, 
DEFENDING THE HOMELAND, AND ENFORCING FEDERAL LAWS ON THE WATERWAYS, WE SALUTE 
YOUR TRADITION OF EXCELLENCE.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO OUR GREAT NATION, 
SEMPER PARATUS, AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SHIPMATES!

5.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL JONATHAN W. GREENERT, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
