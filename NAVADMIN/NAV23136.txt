REF/A/DOC/SECNAV/16AUG2019// 
NARR/REF A IS SECNAV M-1650.1 NAVY AND MARINE CORPS AWARDS MANUAL.// 
 
RMKS/1. The purpose of this NAVADMIN is to enhance efficiency across the 
Department of the Navy (DON) by providing amplifying guidance for 
originating, endorsing, and processing recommendations to assist awarding 
authorities in recognizing deserving units with an appropriate award within 
an acceptable time period.  The basic eligibility and criteria contained in 
reference (a) remains unchanged. 
 
2. The typical unit award in the last year has taken more than 700 days from 
the end of the meritorious period and more than 400 days from the date or 
origination to receive a decision from the approval authority.  This timeline 
is simply not acceptable.  Unit decorations must be originated as soon as 
practicable after the distinguishing act or period of service to be 
recognized. 
 
3. The following guidance, timelines, and best practices for unit awards are 
provided to facilitate a smooth process for final disposition. 
    a.  Recommendations shall be initiated no later than 60 days following 
the completion of the meritorious period for which the award is being 
recommended and shall be routed through either the Administrative (for 
sustained performance) or Operational (for deployment) Chain of 
Command.  Additionally, unit awards must reach the CNO Awards Branch (DNS-13) 
no later than 120 days from the end of the meritorious period.  Any 
recommendation not submitted in a timely manner must be accompanied by a 
letter with full explanation of the circumstances that caused the delay.  The 
letter must also include actions the submitting command is taking to prevent 
future late unit awards submissions.  "Administrative oversight" is not an 
acceptable explanation. 
    b.  Errors or missing information in the submitted recommendation 
adversely affect processing and adjudication.  Endorsing Commanders have the 
responsibility to return the award submission to the originator if it is not 
submitted in accordance with reference (a) and this NAVADMIN.  Common errors 
observed include: 
        (1) Incorrect cited unit.  The cited unit's name listed in Block 6 
should match Standard Navy Distribution List (SNDL) naming conventions.  The 
SNDL can be accessed via https://flankspeed.sharepoint-
mil.us/sites/OPNAV/DNS/DNS1/DNS12/SitePages/Home.aspx. 
        (2) Meritorious dates in the Summary of Action (SOA) and proposed 
citation must match the date indicated in Block 17. 
        (3) The actions of the participating commands referenced in the 
citation, must match what is in the SOA. 
        (4) Any unit mentioned in the SOA must be included in the 
participating command supplemental. 
        (5) Missing or incomplete list of participating commands- 
participating command lists are either missing or incomplete.  All commands 
listed must also have Unit Identification Code listed. 
        (6) OPNAV 1650/14 Unit Award Recommendation that does not have all 
appropriate endorsers will be returned without action. 
        (7) An estimated total number of personnel (Officer, Enlisted, U.S. 
Civilians, other U.S. Armed Forces, or Foreign Militaries) who would be 
eligible to participate in the award if approved must be included with the 
recommendation.
