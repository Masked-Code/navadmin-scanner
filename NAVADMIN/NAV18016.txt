REF B IS MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1910-702, GENERAL GUIDANCE FOR SEPARATION 
AUTHORITIES (SA).//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Separation Authority (SA) requirement 
for all Navy enlisted personnel diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder 
(PTSD) or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) being administratively separated 
(ADSEP)for misconduct in line with reference (a).

2.  In line with reference (b), if a service member has been diagnosed with 
PTSD or TBI, a determination must be made as to whether the PTSD or TBI may 
have been a contributing factor to the conduct forming one or more of the 
bases supporting the ADSEP action. This determination shall not be made by 
the SA, but by a mental health professional diagnosing the PTSD or TBI or a 
higher-level mental health professional consistent with Surgeon General 
guidance. For those individuals diagnosed with PTSD or TBI, the Chief of 
Naval Personnel (CHNAVPERS), or higher authority, will act as SA.

3.  All enlisted personnel who request separation in lieu of court- martial 
and have been diagnosed with PTSD or TBI are also required to receive an 
assessment by an appropriate mental health professional or higher-level 
mental health professional consistent with Surgeon General guidance to 
determine whether PTSD or TBI contributed to the basis which the member is 
being separated. In such cases involving PTSD or TBI, CHNAVPERS, or higher 
authority, will act as SA. MILPERSMAN Article 1910-106 Separation in Lieu of 
Trial by Court Martial will be updated to reflect this requirement

4.  Point of contact is Enlisted Separations (PERS-832), who can be reached 
at (901) 874-3045/DSN 882 or via e-mail at pers832adseps(at)navy.mil.
