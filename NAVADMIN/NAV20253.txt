RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides an update to temporary guidance for Navy 
personnel who require Common Access Card (CAC) and Uniformed Services 
Identification (USID) Card services during the COVID-19 emergency in 
accordance with references (a) through (d).  This NAVADMIN cancels references 
(e) and (f) and implements references (g) and (h).

2.  In accordance with reference (f), the option of using expired CACs for 
physical access to military installations ends effective 30 September 2020.  
In addition, CAC-Identification (ID) certificates will not be extended past 
30 September 2020.  All CAC holders who have an expired CAC will need to 
report to the nearest identification card issuing facility as soon as 
possible to obtain a new CAC and certificates.  Acceptance of an expired USID 
card (held by retirees and dependents) for access to DoD installations 
remains in effect until 30 March 2021 or until reference (f) is cancelled.

3.  DoD personnel should contact the nearest identification card issuing 
facility to schedule an available time to have their CAC reissued.  The ID 
card facility will accommodate both telephone and online appointment 
requests.
    a.  Starting 14 September 2020, Navy ID card facilities will be offering 
extended hours of operation and more walk-in time availability.  In addition, 
the following sites will be open for appointments on Saturday through 30 
September 2020:  NAVBASE San Diego, CA, NAVSTA Mayport, FL, NAS Jacksonville, 
FL, NTC Great Lakes, Norfolk Main Navy Exchange, Norfolk, VA and NAS Whidbey 
Island Seaplane Base, WA.
    b.  ID card site personnel will contact all those who have appointments 
for the month of September to verify the appointment is for CAC issuance.  If 
the appointment is for a USID card, the appointment will be rescheduled after 
1 October 2020.
    c.  Customers will be screened upon reporting to the ID card facility to 
ensure that service is needed for the CAC holder.  All USID cardholders with 
the exception of emergent issues (lost/stolen/initial issuance) will be 
rescheduled for an appointment at a later date.
    d.  Personnel are encouraged to contact the ID card site directly prior 
to arriving at the site as a walk-in.  This will enable the site to book 
appropriate time slots for CAC reissuance.
Personnel can obtain the contact phone number for the site at 
https://idco.dmdc.osd.mil/idco/.
    e.  Commands are requested to assist in emphasizing that only those with 
an expired CAC request an appointment until the end of September to 
prioritize the necessary work at the ID card sites.

4. The following additional policy changes are authorized until
30 June 2021:
    a.  If the affiliation of a cardholder with their service has not changed 
(i.e. they are still entitled to benefits), USID cards which expired on or 
after 1 January 2020 are authorized for continued benefits use (e.g. 
commissary, exchange) through 30 June 2021.
    b.  The minimum age of USID card initial issuance is increased from 10 
years to 14 years.
    c.  Continued use of the Reserve USID card to obtain active-duty benefits 
is authorized for mobilized Reserve Component members and their eligible 
dependents.
    d.  Remote Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System
(DEERS) enrollment for newly acquired dependents (i.e. spouse, child, 
stepchild, adopted child) is authorized to provide healthcare coverage.  
Documentation may be scanned and e-mailed to approved Navy RAPIDS sites for 
completion of the remote enrollment process.
Examples of required documentation are marriage certificate, divorce decree, 
birth certificate, adoption decree, acknowledgment of paternity and social 
security card.  Remote enrollment processing will be centralized at:  Joint 
Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, HI, NAVSUBASE New London, CT, NAS Whidbey Island 
Seaplane Base, WA, NAF El Centro, CA, NSA Annapolis, MD, NAS Fallon, NV, NAS 
Oceana, VA, NSA Mid-South, TN and NAVSUBASE Kings Bay, GA.  Contact MyNavy 
Career Center at 1-833-330-6622 or via e-mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil for 
specific documentation requirements and POC information for the above remote 
enrollment processing sites.
    e.  USID card reissuance via USPS is authorized for Service Members who 
are unable to secure an appointment at a RAPIDS site.
Service Members using this capability must contact the nearest ID card 
issuing facility prior to submitting documentation to ensure all required 
documents are provided for their specific circumstances.  Location and 
contact information for the nearest ID card issuance facility can be obtained 
through https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/.  USID cards issued during remote 
enrollment will not exceed 1 year to allow time for the Service Members to 
provide original or state certified copies of enrollment documents to the ID 
card issuing facility.

5.  If you or a family member have a dependent or retiree ID card please be 
aware that your benefits (e.g. medical, dental) will remain in effect as long 
as your military sponsor is entitled to benefits.  For example, the family of 
a married E-6 with an end of active obligated service date of January 2022 is 
authorized DOD benefits until that date, regardless of the status of their ID 
card(s).

6.  Primary points of contact are:
    a.  General ID card services inquiries:  MyNavy Career Center, 1-833-330-
6622 or via e-mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil.
    b.  Installation access issues:  Mr. Zachary Parks, CNIC N34, (202) 433-
