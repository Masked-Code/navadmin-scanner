REF/A/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON DC/251459ZOCT18//
AMPN/REF A IS NAVADMIN 263/18, UPDATE TO NAVY GRADUATE EDUCATION PROGRAM.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Navy Strategic 
Education and Academic (SEA) Plan and provides guidance on the new method to 
notify Sailors of education program information, applications and deadlines 
going forward.

2.  The SEA Plan replaces the Graduate Education Quota Plan and reflects Navy 
efforts to shift from quota-based approaches to talent management.  To this 
end, the FY-20 SEA Plan aims at ensuring the highest performing individuals 
are encouraged and placed in selective graduate level programs that will 
enhance Navy warfighting capabilities and sustain our maritime superiority.  
The SEA Plan provides over 1,200 opportunities for degree and non-degree 
programs across the full spectrum of communities and ranks.

3.  To align with policy changes for In-Residence Graduate Education
(IRGE) included in reference (a), selection for FY-20 SEA Plan opportunities 
for unrestricted line officers will be conducted through administrative 
boards to screen the most fully qualified, due course officers for top-line, 
key competitive IRGE and in- residence Joint Professional Military Education 
opportunities.

4.  To personalize education program announcements, reduce administrative 
distractions and align with identity management requirements, program 
announcements will no longer be promulgated via NAVADMIN.  Instead, these 
announcements will be delivered through MyNavy Education, a web-based 
application.

5.  MyNavy Education launched the Notification Center on 26 June
2018 to increase accessibility and improve secure communications directly to 
Sailors for voluntary education programs.  The Navy is expanding the use of 
these notifications to disseminate important information for graduate 
education and fellowship programs.  Sailors are strongly encouraged to log 
into the system and update their profile and e-mail addresses in MyNavy 
Education to receive alerts in the event of program updates.  For a list of 
education programs and instructions on how to receive notifications via 
MyNavy Education, please visit https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/training-
education-qualifications/e-graduate-education-and-fellowship-
programs.

6.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.

7.  Released by Vice Admiral R. P. Burke, N1.//
