2.  THE LATERAL TRANSFER/REDESIGNATION BOARD IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE.  EACH 
RECORD THAT IS PRESENTED TO THE BOARD IS CAREFULLY REVIEWED AND THE BEST AND 
MOST FULLY QUALIFIED ARE CHOSEN.

3.  QUOTA CONSTRAINTS FOR JUNIOR YEAR GROUPS (06 THROUGH 10) WERE ESPECIALLY 
TIGHT THUS THE DEMAND SIGNAL FAR EXCEEDED THE SUPPLY POOL.  MANY QUALITY

SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE.

A POOL OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES.  ELIGIBLE OFFICERS NOT INITIALLY 
SELECTED, AND WHO DID NOT SPECIFICALLY REQUEST NOT TO BE REVIEWED BY 
COMMUNITIES OTHER THAN THEIR FIRST OR SECOND CHOICE, WERE SUBSEQUENTLY 
REVIEWED BY ALL OTHER COMMUNITIES.  THOSE OFFICERS TENTATIVELY SELECTED FOR 
COMMUNITIES NOT INITIALLY REQUESTED WILL BE NOTIFIED VIA OFFICIAL 
CORRESPONDENCE AND OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDESIGNATE.

5.  THE PROCESS, WHILE NEVER PERFECT, IS FAIR AND THOROUGH.
BOARD MEMBERS ARE FOCUSED ON THEIR TASK: PICKING THE RIGHT CANDIDATE WHO IS 
FULLY AND BEST QUALIFIED FROM THE AVAILABLE APPLICANTS.  EACH RECORD RECEIVES 
A DETAILED SCRUB AND THERE IS THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE DISCUSSIONS ON EACH 
APPLICANT.

SELECTEE.

WILL FORWARD A REDESIGNATION LETTER TO THE SELECTEE OR APPOINTMENT ACCEPTANCE 
AND OATH OF OFFICE (NAVPERS 1000/4), AS APPLICABLE.
    B.  OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT PROMOTION SELECTEES AND WHO ARE NOT UNDER ORDERS 
CAN EXPECT ASSIGNMENT TO A NEW BILLET APPROPRIATE TO THEIR NEW DESIGNATION 
WHEN NOTIFIED BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4).
    C.  IF A MEMBER IS CURRENTLY UNDER ORDERS AND TRANSFERS PRIOR TO 
NOTIFICATION BY COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4), MEMBER MUST EXECUTE ORDERS UNDER 
CURRENT DESIGNATOR AND MUST COMPLETE 12 MONTHS AT THE NEW ASSIGNMENT, UNLESS A 
SHORTER TOUR IS PRESCRIBED (TOURS IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR WILL BE WITH THE 
CONCURRENCE OF THE GAINING COMMUNITY), PRIOR TO REDESIGNATION.

    A.  SURFACE WARFARE (11XX) OFFICERS WHO ARE UNDER ORDERS TO DEPARTMENT 
HEAD SCHOOL MAY NOT LATERALLY TRANSFER UNTIL COMPLETION OF INITIAL DEPARTMENT 
HEAD TOUR.
