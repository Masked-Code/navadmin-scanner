RMKS/1.  Background.  Disease modeling forecasts that severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-
19, will continue to spread throughout the remainder of 2021.  Data and 
modeling also indicate that the available vaccines will continue to be 
effective against severe illness and mortality caused by COVID 19.  Of note, 
all Navy COVID deaths have been individuals not immunized (one individual was 
partially vaccinated).  In consideration of this persistent health and 
readiness threat to Navy service members, vaccination against COVID-19 is now 
mandatory per references (a) and (b).  This NAVADMIN provides guidance 
regarding implementation within the Navy.

2.  Policy.  In accordance with references (a), (b), and this NAVADMIN, Navy 
service members will be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 through 
administration of vaccines that have received Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) licensure or through the voluntary administration of vaccines under FDA 
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or World Health Organization (WHO) 
Emergency Use Listing.

2.a.  Navy Service Members.  Active duty service members, service members in 
the selected reserve, and service members in the Individual Ready Reserve are 
considered Navy service members for the purposes of this NAVADMIN.

2.b.  Fully Vaccinated.  Navy service members vaccinated per paragraph 2 or 
voluntarily immunized with a COVID-19 vaccine under FDA EUA or WHO Emergency 
Use Listing in accordance with applicable dose requirements prior to, or 
after, the establishment of this policy are considered fully vaccinated.
Navy service members are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after 
completing the second dose of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccine or two weeks after 
receiving a single dose of a one-dose COVID-19 vaccine.  Booster shots are 
still under evaluation and will be addressed via separate message.

2.c.  Coordination.  Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) will coordinate 
ordering, distributing, and administering vaccines, along with their 
supported activities, units, and other eligible populations.

2.d.  COVID-19 Disease Prevention.  Vaccination has proven to be the most 
effective defense against serious illness caused by COVID-19.  Maintaining a 
clean work environment, good hygiene practices including cough/sneeze 
etiquette, and managing workforce exposure (e.g., social distancing, 
teleworking, and sick leave) also continue to be effective tools in reducing 
the spread of COVID-19.

3.  COVID-19 Vaccination Administering Requirements and Reporting

3.a.  COVID-19 vaccination is mandatory for all DoD service members who are 
not medically or administratively exempt per references (c), (d), and (e).  
Navy service members who are not medically or administratively exempt shall 
be fully vaccinated against
COVID-19 as defined in paragraph 2.b above.

3.b.  Active duty Navy service members will be fully vaccinated within 90 
days from the date of reference (b).  Ready Reserve Navy service members will 
be fully vaccinated within 120 days from the date of reference (b).  New 
accessions will be fully vaccinated as soon as practicable following service 
entry.

3.c.  This NAVADMIN constitutes a lawful order.  Refusal to be fully 
vaccinated against COVID-19, absent an approved exemption, will constitute a 
failure to obey a lawful order and is punishable under the Uniform Code of 
Military Justice and/or may result in administrative action.  Adjudication 
will be in accordance with paragraph 3.e.(5) below.  Prior to receiving the 
COVID-19 vaccine, Navy service members will have access to healthcare 
providers to address questions regarding the risks of COVID-19 and the 
benefits of COVID-19 vaccination.

3.d.  Exemptions.  The two types of exemptions from immunization are medical 
and administrative.  Administrative exemptions include religious 
accommodations, per references (d) and (e), as well as others per reference 
(c).  The process for obtaining exemptions for mandatory vaccinations is 
provided in reference
(c) for medical and administrative exemptions and references
(d) and (e) for religious accommodations.  Specifically for the COVID-19 
vaccination, in addition to the processes in reference (c), the authority to 
grant approval of a permanent medical exemption is the first Navy Medical 
Department Flag Officer in the medical providers chain of command.  Medical 
Departments may send questions regarding the permanent medical exemption 
process to usn.ncr.bumedfchva.mbx.bumed--- 2019-ncov-response-
cell(AT)mail.mil.

3.d.(1).  A history of COVID-19 disease and/or positive serology does not 
exempt a Navy service member from receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.  Those Navy 
service members who previously received a medical exemption from COVID-19 
vaccine while the vaccines were authorized under an EUA will be reevaluated 
per paragraph 3.d above.

3.d.(2).  Navy service members who are actively participating in COVID-19 
clinical trials are exempt from mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 until 
the trial is complete.

3.e.  Commanders, Commanding Officers, and Officers in Charge will:

3.e.(1).  Identify Navy service members who are not vaccinated against COVID-
19 using Medical Readiness Reporting System
(MRRS) detailed in paragraph 3.f below.

3.e.(2).  Provide sufficient resources to local MTFs or vaccination locations 
to execute local vaccination plans.
In coordination with local commanders, MTFs will develop plans to administer 
vaccinations.

3.e.(3).  In coordination with supporting cognizant medical authority, direct 
that unvaccinated Navy service members will initiate vaccination with an FDA-
licensed vaccine or, optionally and alternatively, with a vaccine approved 
for emergency use, on a timeline that achieves full vaccination per paragraph

3.b above.  This direction will include information and guidance regarding 
vaccine availability and administering locations.

3.e.(4).  For Navy service members without a pending exemption request or 
whose exemption request was denied, provide counseling regarding refusal to 
take the COVID-19 vaccine.  This counseling will include access to a 
healthcare professional to answer questions regarding the risks of COVID-19 
and the benefits of
COVID-19 vaccinations.  Commands will then issue a uniform NAVPERS 1070/613 
(Page 13) ordering initiation of the COVID-19 vaccine series, to be completed 
within the time requirements of paragraph 3.b above.  An example NAVPERS 
1070/613 can be found at:
https://portal.secnav.navy.mil/cop/crc/COVID/Documentationand
PDFTraining/Forms/Allitems.aspx.

3.e.(5).  For Navy service members who remain unvaccinated, and who have or 
are expected to exceed the time requirements of paragraph 3.b, their ultimate 
disposition will be determined by the designated COVID Consolidated 
Disposition Authority (CCDA).  The CCDA will serve as the central authority 
for adjudication and will have at his or her disposal the full range of 
administrative and disciplinary actions.  Until further notice, authority is 
withheld for initiating non- judicial punishment, courts-martial, or 
administrative separation in cases of Navy Service Members refusing the 
vaccine. The assigned CCDA and specific required reporting procedures and 
information will be promulgated via separate message.

3.f.  COVID-19 Vaccination Reporting

3.f.(1).  Navy service member vaccination administration compliance will be 
monitored via MRRS.  Designated command personnel will access MRRS to track 
personnel to ensure compliance.

3.f.(2).  Vaccine administrators must report vaccine administration errors, 
serious adverse vaccine reactions or clinically significant adverse events in 
the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System:
https://vaers.hhs.gov/resources/infoproviders.html.

3.f.(3).  Vaccine administrators must ensure that documentation of COVID-19 
vaccine administration is coded to accurately reflect the type of vaccine 
provided.

3.f.(4).  COVID-19 immunization documentation will be completed within an 
approved electronic health record (EHR).  Afloat units will enter COVID-19 
immunizations into the Shipboard Automated Medical System/Theater Medical 
Information Program for subsequent transfer to MRRS.  Garrison units will 
enter COVID-19 immunizations into AHLTA/MHS GENESIS for subsequent transfer 
to MRRS.
When an approved EHR is not available, readiness documentation may be entered 
directly in MRRS, but must also be entered into EHR once available.

3.f.(5).  Navy service members who receive the vaccine from a retail network 
pharmacy or other non-DoD vaccine administrator must provide documentation of 
COVID-19 vaccination to their respective command no later than the next duty 
day for Active Component or within 7 days for Reserve Component for entry 
into EHR and/or MRRS.

3.f.(6).  Shore-based commands will request access to MRRS based on unit 
identification code by submitting a system access authorization request 
available at:  //mrrs.dc3n.
navy.mil/mrrs (note:  MRRS Web address is case sensitive).
Point of contact:  MRRS program office, mrrspo(AT)navy.mil /
(800) 537-4617 / (504) 697-7070 / DSN:  647-7070.  Ship-based commands may 
utilize Navy Medicine Online or Shipboard Non-Tactical Automated Data 
Processing Automated Medical System to populate MRRS.

4.  COVID-19 Vaccination Administration

4.a.  Vaccine administrators should follow the guidance provided in 
references (f) and (g).

4.b.  Per reference (h), there is no harm (contraindication) for co-
administration of the COVID-19 vaccination with other vaccines.

4.c.  COVID-19 Vaccine Ordering.  Naval Medical Logistics Command is 
responsible for coordinating distribution of
COVID-19 vaccine for all Navy and Marine Corps activities:
usn.detrick.navmedlogcomftdmd.list.vialhelp(AT)mail.mil.  Navy
COVID-19 vaccine is centrally funded.  Navy activities will place their order 
for COVID-19 vaccine via USAMMA-DOC's secure web site:
https://a01.usamma.amedd.army.mil/docvac/Account/Login.

4.d.  COVID-19 Vaccine Integrity.  If temperature limits are exceeded during 
shipment, upon receipt immunization sites must call DLA or USAMMA-DOC at 301-
619-4318/8002 or
DSN:  343-4318/8002 and DLA DSCPColdchain(AT)dla.mil or 
paacoldchainteam(AT)@dla.mil.  For temperature limits exceeded in storage 
please refer to the following website:
https://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-
Readiness/Immunization-Healthcare/Vaccine-Storage-and-
Handling/Potential-Vaccine-Compromise-Reporting.

4.e.  Vaccination and Reporting Timeline

4.e.(1).  Due to the risk of rapid infection transmission within units and 
potential impact on operations, vaccines should be given as quickly as 
possible.  MTFs should be prepared to begin administration of vaccine within 
24 hours of receipt.  If directly receiving the vaccine, active duty 
operational units have 72 hours (three working days) following receipt of the 
vaccine to begin documentation, administration, and vaccination reporting.

4.e.(2).  As schedules vary for Navy service members in the Selected Reserve 
or Individual Ready Reserve, NMLC will coordinate with DLA and the ordering 
Reserve Command for the vaccine to arrive the week of a drill weekend.
Units have 30 days following receipt of the vaccine to document, administer, 
and report vaccination.

4.e.(3).  Installations and MTFs may use the Navy Family Accountability and 
Assessment System, similar to seasonal influenza efforts, conduct a Pandemic 
COVID-19 response exercises in conjunction with the COVID-19 vaccine program.
