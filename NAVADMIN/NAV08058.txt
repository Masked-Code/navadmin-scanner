SUBJ/NAVY RESERVE BIRTHDAY MESSAGE// 
RMKS/1.  AS WE COMMEMORATE AND CELEBRATE THE 93RD BIRTHDAY OF OUR NAVY 
RESERVE ON 3 MARCH 2008, I EXTEND MY SINCERE APPRECIATION TO ALL 
SAILORS WHO ARE SERVING OUR NATION AT HOME AND ABROAD, AND TO OUR 
FAMILIES AND FRIENDS WHO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT WHICH ENABLES US TO SERVE.
2.  SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THE NAVY RESERVE HAS EMBODIED OUR CORE VALUES 
OF HONOR, COURAGE, AND COMMITMENT.  OVER 200 YEARS AGO, THOMAS 
JEFFERSON PROPOSED A NATIONAL NAVAL MILITIA.  CITIZEN-SAILOR GROUPS 
WERE FORMED TO AUGMENT THE NAVY DURING THE CIVIL AND SPANISH-AMERICAN 
WARS, AND IN 1915 CONGRESS ESTABLISHED THE FEDERAL NAVAL RESERVE.  
THROUGHOUT THEIR HISTORY, NAVY RESERVISTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED 
SIGNIFICANTLY TO OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE AND ALL MAJOR CONFLICTS.  SINCE 
SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, MORE THAN 50,000 AUGMENTATION REQUIREMENTS HAVE 
BEEN FILLED BY RESERVE SAILORS IN SUPPORT OF COMBATANT COMMANDS WAGING 
THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR.  TODAY, MORE THAN 20,000 NAVY RESERVISTS, OR 
ABOUT 29 PERCENT OF THE RESERVE FORCE, ARE ON ORDERS PROVIDING FULLY 
INTEGRATED, GLOBAL OPERATIONAL SUPPORT TO THE FLEET.
3.  OUR RESERVE COMPONENT (RC) IS A FULL PARTNER IN NAVY’S TOTAL FORCE.  
WITH THEIR CONTINUED READINESS, RESPONSIVE POSTURE, AND RELEVANT 
CAPABILITIES, RC SAILORS ARE MORE ALIGNED AND INTEGRATED WITH THE FLEET 
THAN EVER BEFORE AND ENABLE US TO ACCOMPLISH OUR MISSION.  I CANNOT 
OVERSTATE MY APPRECIATION FOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF RESERVISTS IN THE 
PAST YEAR.  FROM SUPPORT IN THE HOMELAND DURING THE MINNEAPOLIS BRIDGE 
COLLAPSE AND CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES, TO OPERATIONS ENDURING FREEDOM AND 
IRAQI FREEDOM AND ROUTINE OPERATIONAL SUPPORT AT EVERY NAVY COMMAND, I 
THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO SERVICE AND INDIVIDUAL 
READINESS.
4.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SHIPMATES.  AS CNO, I AM PROUD OF WHO YOU ARE AND 
WHAT YOU DO FOR OUR NATION, NAVY, AND COMMUNITIES.
5.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
