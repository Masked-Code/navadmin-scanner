SUBJ/PROFESSIONAL MILITARY KNOWLEDGE ELIGIBILITY EXAM (PMK-EE)//

REF/A/DOC/BUPERS/2NOV07//
AMPN/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1430.16F, ADVANCEMENT MANUAL FOR ENLISTED PERSONNEL 
OF THE U.S. NAVY AND U.S. NAVY RESERVE.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces establishment of the Professional Military 
Knowledge Eligibility Exam (PMK-EE) for the Navy.  As part of Sailor 2025 and 
Rating Modernization efforts, the PMK-EE was created to provide greater 
emphasis on Professional Military Knowledge (PMK) and to separate it from 
examinations on rating knowledge.  This is an initial step toward electronic 
advancement exams, and eventually, individually tailored rating exams, unique 
to the navy enlisted classifications held by a Sailor.  PMK-EE will serve as 
an additional eligibility requirement for advancement to paygrades E4/5/6/7.  
PMK-EE will be delivered electronically, and will be available via the My 
Navy Portal website beginning in October 2018.

2.  Sailors must attain a passing score on PMK-EE prior to 1 September 2019 
to participate in Advancement Cycle 244.  PMK content will no longer be 
included on the NWAE starting with the September 2019 E4/5/6 Exam.

3.  PMK-EE Requirements and Administration:
    a.  Sailors are required to successfully pass PMK-EE only once per 
paygrade.
    b.  PMK-EE must be successfully completed by the first day of the NWAE 
administration month.
    c.  Sailors will be able to access the PMK-EE via My Navy Portal through 
the Learning Management System (LMS).
    d.  PMK-EE will consist of 100 questions representing five (5) topic 
areas (Leadership and Character, Career Information, Professional Conduct, 
Naval Heritage, and Seamanship).  Each topic area may be taken independently 
of the other sections and in any order.  Sailors must achieve a passing score 
of 80 percent or higher in each topic area to pass PMK-EE.  Failure to 
achieve an 80 percent score on a topic will require that topic to be retaken.
    e.  Once each topic area is completed, the LMS will provide the number of 
questions successfully answered for that topic, as well as the associated 
reference for incorrectly answered questions.  Once all topic areas are 
successfully completed, PMK-EE will be finalized in the LMS and an overall 
exam score will be displayed.
    f.  The topics and bibliographies used to develop PMK-EE questions will 
be available on the Advancement and Promotion webpage located on the My Navy 
Portal website.
    g.  PMK-EE completion will be recorded in the LMS and the Navy Training 
Management Planning System (NTMPS).  NTMPS can be used to determine 
individual Sailor eligibility for advancement.
