SUBJ/FY12 SAFETY RECAP

(703) 695-4704/EMAIL:KYLE.KETCHUM(AT)NAVY.MIL//

RMKS/1. FY12 STATISTICS SHOW FLEET WIDE SAFETY TRENDING IN THE WRONG 
DIRECTION. THERE WERE 58 NON-COMBAT FATALITIES; A 35 PERCENT INCREASE OVER 
LAST YEAR, CLASS B MISHAP RATE INCREASED OVER 50 PERCENT, 20 FATALITIES DUE TO 
MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENTS. SEVEN PEDESTRIAN OR BICYCLE FATALITIES, THE HIGEST 
NUMBER OF INCIDENTS IN OVER 25 YEARS. OUR NON-COMBAT MISHAP DAMAGE TOTALS OVER 
500 MILLION DOLLARS. WE CAN AND MUST DO BETTER.

2. I EXPECT ALL LEADERS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO FOLLOW ESTABLISHED SAFETY 
PROGRAMS AND PROCESSES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO:
(A) EOSS/CSOSS
(B) OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT
(C) EVENT/EVOLUTION BRIEFING AND DEBRIEFING
(D) MOTORCYCLE SAFETY
LEADERS ARE DIRECTED TO UTILIZE SAFETY RELATED PROGRAMS, BRIEFING AIDS, 
COURSES, AND OTHER MATERIALS AVAILABLE AT SAFETYCENTER.NAVY.MIL.

3. WE OWE OUR SAILORS AND OUR NAVY, OUR BEST EFFORTS TO GUARD AGAINST MISHAPS 
THAT CAN BE AVOIDED. ENGAGED LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVE SAFETY MEASURES CAN 
PREVENT LOSS OF WARFIGHTING CAPABILITY AND MISSION READINESS.

4. RELEASED BY VICE ADMIRAL R. W. HUNT, DIRECTOR, NAVY STAFF.
