AMPN/REF A IS THE JOINT FLEET MAINTENANCE MANUAL 2M ELECTRONIC REPAIR 
CHAPTER// 
 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  In 1997 the deputy chief of naval operations (logistics) 
implemented a CNO Gold Disk Awards Program.  This program was designed to 
encourage Fleet personnel in the maritime community to develop gold disk test 
routines and repair circuit card assemblies and electronic modules.  The 
resulting benefits have resulted in improved operational readiness of a wide 
range of C5I and HM&E systems in addition to significantly improved OPTAR 
cost avoidance.  The award consists of a letter of commendation signed by 
Deputy CNO for Integration of Capabilities and Resources and a military cash 
award of up to five thousand dollars. 
 
2.  The cash award criteria is a graduated dollar value dependent upon cost 
avoidance thresholds.  The award program not only rewards the top repair 
technician, but every technician that meets the following quarterly cost 
avoidance thresholds: 
$150k to $199k of cost avoidance yields a $2k award 
$200k to $249k of cost avoidance yields a $3k award 
$250k to $299k of cost avoidance yields a $4k award 
$300k and over of cost avoidance yields a $5k award 
 
3.  The CNO gold disk awards program is administered by the NAVSEA miniature 
Microminiature Module Test and Repair (2M MTR) program manager.  Fleet 2M MTR 
policy and responsibilities are contained in reference (a).  Gold Disk 
Awardees are selected by an awards board at NUWC detachment field engineering 
office in Norfolk.  The MTR engineering agents selection is based on 2M 
repair metrics submitted in the Module Test and Repair tracking system or 
verification of recently submitted gold disk test routines.
