REF D IS TITLE 37 U.S. CODE, PAY AND ALLOWANCES OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a) and announces that reference 
(b) is superseded by reference (c).

2.  Enlisted Supervisor Retention Pay (ESRP) provides a retention incentive 
to senior Navy nuclear-trained enlisted personnel with highly specialized 
skills.  The legal authority for ESRP shifted from Section 355 of reference 
(d) to section 331 of reference (d) effective 4 July 2016.  The following 
programmatic changes apply and are reflected in reference (c):
    a.  The minimum reenlistment length is 3 years instead of 2 years 
previously.
    b.  The maximum bonus amount for each year of obligated service is 
limited to $25,000.  The implication of this limit is that the maximum ESRP 
bonus for a three year reenlistment is now $75,000.
    c.  All ESRP payments must be received prior to completion of 26 years of 
service.  The implication of this limit is that any ESRP installment that 
would be due after 26 years of service will be paid in the final installment 
prior to completion of 26 years of service.

3.  Award Multiples.  No changes to ESRP bonus multiples are promulgated in 
this NAVADMIN.  The current multiples are listed below.

4.  Eligibility.  Only Sailors assigned an active supervisory nuclear Navy 
enlisted classification (NEC) listed in paragraph 3 are eligible to reenlist 
for ESRP.  ESRP requests for personnel being processed for NEC removal or 
restoration will be held in abeyance pending final resolution.  Overall ESRP 
eligibility requirements are defined in reference (c).  In addition, to 
encourage career progression and provide incentive for continued superior at-
sea service, the following supplementary eligibility requirements remain in 
place for each ESRP zone:
    a.  ESRP Zone 1.  In addition to the requirements of reference (c), be 
assigned an active nuclear supervisory NEC (see paragraph 3).
    b.  ESRP Zone 2.  In addition to the requirements of reference (c), be a 
frocked chief petty officer or in the pay grade of E-7, E- 8, or E-9 on the 
date of the ESRP Zone 2 reenlistment.
    c.  ESRP Zone 3.  In addition to the requirements of reference
(c):
        (1) Be a frocked E-8 or in the pay grade of E-8 or E-9 on the date of 
the ESRP Zone 3 reenlistment.
        (2) Have successfully previously served as, be currently serving as, 
or have accepted orders as a submarine engineering department master chief, 
nuclear aircraft carrier (CVN) leading chief petty officer, or CVN reactor 
department master chief.

5.  Application Process.  ESRP reenlistment requests will be submitted 35-120 
days in advance of the member's desired reenlistment date to ensure the 
approval message is released in a timely manner.  Exceptions to this policy 
will be approved by the ESRP program manager on an individual basis.
    a.  Officer Personnel Information System (OPINS) Force Management System 
is programmed to process ESRP reenlistment requests and employs the same 
process used to request and approve selective reenlistment bonus reenlistment 
requests.  Career counselors and personnel support detachments are familiar 
with this program and should use it as the primary method of ESRP request 
submission.  The ESRP request type is 3AA for Sailors on active duty and 3BB 
for broken service requests.
    b.  In the event OPINS is not available, the command can e-mail (scanned 
copy of request), or mail the request directly to the ESRP program manager 
utilizing the format found in reference (c).  If operational commitments 
limit the ability to submit ESRP applications via this manner, commands 
should submit the ESRP request via message to the immediate superior in 
charge, who can submit the OPINS request.  ESRP requests sent directly to the 
ESRP program manager by message or mail may result in a processing delay.
    c.  E-6 and below Zone 1 Sailors not already obligated beyond 14 years of 
service will require an approved Career Waypoints (C-WAY) reenlistment quota.  
C-WAY submission and quota approval can be pursued in parallel with the OPINS 
request for ESRP.
    d.  A Sailor must be pre-approved for an ESRP reenlistment.
ESRP approval will not currently notify the Defense Joint Military Pay System 
(DJMS) of the Sailor's intent to reenlist.  Until DJMS can be programmed to 
accept ESRP reenlistment payments, manual processing is required.  Payments 
should post to the Sailor's account within 14 days following the day the ESRP 
program manager receives notification of reenlistment.  Initial payment will 
be authorized as soon as the contract execution is reflected in the enlisted 
master file (EMF).  In order to ensure prompt payment, new contracts must be 
posted to the EMF in a timely manner.
    e.  Personnel support detachments and commands should contact Nuclear 
Propulsion Programs (N133D) vice Defense Finance and Accounting System to 
resolve any payment issues.
    f.  A Sailor with an approved pre-certification, who does not reenlist on 
the date specified in the pre-certification message, must resubmit a request 
to revise the reenlistment date and ESRP award amount.

6.  Recoupment.  Receipt of any ESRP bonus is contingent upon the fulfillment 
of the specific conditions of eligibility, service, and assignment of the 
ESRP program.  A Sailor who fails to fulfill these specified conditions 
during the period of service agreed upon shall repay the U.S. Navy any 
unearned portion of the bonus.  Situations requiring repayment are provided 
in reference (c).

7.  Service Record Entry.  An Administrative Remarks, (NAVPERS 1070/613), 
entry acknowledging recoupment policy via Navy Standard Integrated Personnel 
System is required to be entered into the Service Members record prior to 
execution of an ESRP reenlistment; examples are provided in reference (c).

8.  ESRP-eligible Sailors and their command career counselors should review 
reference (c), which provides further program details.
Reference (c) can be found on the nuclear enlisted community manager
website:  http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/enlisted/community/nuclear/Pages/default.aspx.

9.  Point of contact is N133D, at (703)604-5502/5491/5492/5493/DSN
664 or via e-mail at nxag_n133d3(at)navy.mil or bullnuke(at)navy.mil.
