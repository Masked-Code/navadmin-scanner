ENGAGE IN ANY POLITICAL CAMPAIGN OR ELECTION ACTIVITY DURING THE 
VISIT. THE PRECEDING PROHIBITION DOES NOT APPLY TO THE PRESIDENT, 
VICE PRESIDENT OR SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

RESPONSIBILITIES THAT AFFECT THAT INSTALLATION OR THOSE WHO LIVE OR 
WORK THERE, IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS:

INSTALLATION; OR
(2) WHEN THE CANDIDATE SEEKS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ACTIVITIES, 
SERVICES, OR RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO HIM OR HER BY VIRTUE OF
LAW OR POLICY, SUCH AS RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES OPEN TO THE PUBLIC OR 
ENTITLEMENTS OR BENEFITS SUCH AS MEDICAL FACILITIES, COMMISSARIES, 
OR POST/BASE EXCHANGES. INSTALLATION COMMANDERS SHOULD ENSURE THAT 
CANDIDATES WHO ENTER AN INSTALLATION FOR ONE OF THE TWO PURPOSES 
NOTED IN PARAGRAPHS 10B (1) AND 10B (2) DO NOT ENGAGE IN ANY CAMPAIGN 
OR ELECTION ACTIVITY DURING THE VISIT.

ORGANIZATIONS - AS OPPOSED TO THE OFFICIAL STAFF OF THE OFFICE THAT THE 
CANDIDATE CURRENTLY HOLDS; REQUESTS FOR ACCESS TO MILITARY INSTALLATIONS 
OR FACILITIES BY SPOUSES OR FAMILY MEMBERS OF CANDIDATES WHEN SUCH SPOUSES 
OR FAMILY MEMBERS ARE NOT OTHERWISE ENTITLED TO ACCESS BY LAW OR POLICY OR 
WHO OTHERWISE DO NOT HAVE AN INDEPENDENT OFFICIAL PURPOSE; AND REQUESTS FOR 
ACCESS TO MILITARY INSTALLATIONS OR FACILITIES THAT INCLUDE ACCOMPANIMENT 
BY CAMPAIGN STAFF AND/OR PRESS.

COMMANDERS SHOULD OFFER ALL CANDIDATES FOR CIVIL OFFICE WHO ARE NOT 
CURRENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS OR SERVING GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS THE 
SAME ACCESS TO INSTALLATIONS AS ANY OTHER UNOFFICIAL VISITOR.
E. INSTALLATION COMMANDERS SHOULD CONSULT THE OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT

OFFICIAL BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE GRANTS A CANDIDATE ACCESS FOR SUCH 
PURPOSES, THE COMMANDER SHOULD COORDINATE WITH HIS OR HER LEGAL

PARTICIPATE IN OFFICIAL BUSINESS, AND THE MEDIA IS GRANTED ACCESS TO 
COVER THE EVENT, THE CANDIDATE MAY APPEAR ON CAMERA AND IN 
PHOTOGRAPHS AS AN OFFICIAL PARTICIPANT AND MAY MAKE A STATEMENT OR 
ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OFFICIAL BUSINESS BEING CONDUCTED. UNDER

THE CANDIDATE'S REMARKS BE REVIEWED BEFOREHAND; HOWEVER, NO FOOTAGE, 
PHOTOGRAPHS, OR STATEMENTS TAKEN OR RECORDED DURING SUCH OFFICIAL

ELECTION-RELATED PURPOSE. WHEN A CANDIDATE FOR CIVIL OFFICE ARRIVES OR

ARRIVAL OR DEPARTURE IF THE ELECTED OFFICIAL'S ITINERARY INCLUDES 
POLITICAL CAMPAIGNING OR ELECTION ACTIVITY IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY.

PRESIDENT, OR THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT, OR SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE ARRIVES OR DEPARTS

OFFICIAL'S ITINERARY INCLUDES POLITICAL CAMPAIGN OR ELECTION ACTIVITY 
IN SUPPORT OF A PARTICULAR CANDIDATE, THE INSTALLATION COMMANDER WILL

OF THE PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT, OR SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. INSTALLATION 
COMMANDERS ANTICIPATING A VISIT BY THE PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT, OR SPEAKER 
OF THE HOUSE THAT MAY INVOLVE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN OR ELECTION ACTIVITIES
