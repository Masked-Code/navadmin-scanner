RMKS/1.  The Navy League of the United States (NLUS) will hold its annual 
Sea-Air-Space (SAS) exposition from 6 to 8 April, 2020 at the Gaylord 
National Resort and Conference Center, located in National Harbor, MD.  SAS 
provides a platform for the professional development of Department of the 
Navy personnel on the latest developments in naval warfare, as well as an 
opportunity for Navy engagement with representatives from a broad cross-
section of government, industry, academia, and the international community.

2.  This years SAS schedule is designed towards a focus on readiness and 
innovation with panels covering topics ranging from acquisition, cyber, 
strategic sealift, leadership, shipbuilding, and talent management.  SAS will 
showcase leaders from across the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Coast 
Guard, other governmental agencies and industry.  Additionally, many 
international delegations will be in attendance, including several Heads of 
Navy (HoN).  A full list of speakers and more information on international 
representation can be found at www.seaairspace.org.

3.  Per reference (a), attendance at SAS 2020 falls below the
$250,000 requirement for SECNAV/UNSECNAV approval.  Therefore, requests for 
attendance incurring TAD costs shall be consolidated by
Echelon-2 commands and provided to OPNAV with the number of attendees and 
cost estimates to track overall costs and attendance data.  Final conference 
requests are to be submitted no later than 13 March, 2020 with overall 
approval of DON-wide attendance expected mid-March.  If no cost is incurred 
by the government (i.e. people local to area), no submission or approval is 
required.  The following restrictions
apply:
    a.  Subject to command discretion, attendance is authorized for local 
participants at no cost to the government.
    b.  SAS 2020 is primarily an East Coast event.  Funded TAD travel from 
West Coast/International commands should be closely examined unless member 
has an active role in the event (panel participation, an official U.S. Navy 
presentation, etc).  Excessive attendance will be subject to cuts based on 
overall cost.
    c.  NLUS has offered free attendance at the below ten events to all 
military and civilian personnel.  Because there is a maximum number of seats 
available, attendees are required to pre-register.
Per reference (b), this free attendance does not constitute a gift for 
purposes of applicable ethics regulations, and therefore may be accepted by 
all military and civilian personnel.

Ethics Regulations found at reference (c).
