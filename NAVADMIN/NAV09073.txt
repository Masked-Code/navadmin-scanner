INSTRUCTION.// 
RMKS/1.  AS NAVY REMAINS FOCUSED ON PERFORMANCE AND ENHANCING THE 
CULTURE OF PHYSICAL FITNESS, WE SEE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN OUR 
PHYSICAL FITNESS ASSESSMENT (PFA) SUCCESS RATE.  THE SPRING 2003 PFA 
PASS RATE WAS 92.36 PERCENT AND HAS INCREASED TO 95.9 PERCENT FOR FALL 
2008.
2.  REF A IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL POLICY CHANGES THAT INCLUDED ASSIGNMENT
RESTRICTIONS TO SPECIFIED BILLETS FOR SAILORS WHO HAVE TWO PFA FAILURES 
IN THE MOST RECENT THREE-YEAR PERIOD, UNLESS THE MOST RECENT PFA WAS 
PASSED.  IT ALSO REQUIRED ALL CURRENT PFA READINESS AND PROGRESS 
WAIVERS TO BE DOCUMENTED IN THE PHYSICAL READINESS INFORMATION 
MANAGMENT SYSTEM (PRIMS) BY 31 DECEMBER 2008, ANNOUNCED DISCONTINUATION 
OF PROGRESS WAIVERS EFFECTIVE 1 OCTOBER 2009, AND PROHIBITED SHORT-TERM 
EXTENSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PASSING THE PFA.  
REF A REITERATED THE REQUIREMENT TO PROCESS FOR ADSEP ALL SAILORS WHO 
HAVE THREE OR MORE PFA FAILURES IN THE MOST RECENT FOUR-YEAR PERIOD AND 
STRESSED COMMANDING OFFICER ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PRP POLICY COMPLIANCE.
3.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES ADDITIONAL REFINEMENTS TO NAVY'S PRP POLICY
BASED ON FLEET FEEDBACK.  POLICY CHANGES WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE 
NEXT REVISION OF REF B.
4.  THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL PRP POLICY CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE
IMMEDIATELY:
    A.  ACTIVE DUTY SAILORS WHO HAVE THREE OR MORE PFA FAILURES IN THE 
MOST RECENT FOUR-YEAR PERIOD SHALL NOT BE TRANSFERRED TO A NEW 
PERMANENT DUTY STATION, REENLISTED, OR EXTENDED.  DRILLING RESERVISTS 
WITH THREE OR MORE PFA FAILURES IN A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD SHALL NOT BE 
TRANSFERRED TO THE INACTIVE READY RESERVE (IRR) IN LIEU OF BEING 
PROCESSED FOR ADSEP.  WAIVERS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO COMNAVPERSCOM
(PERS-4) VIA THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.
     B.  IF A READINESS WAIVER IS GRANTED TO A SAILOR WHO HAS THREE OR 
MORE PFA FAILURES IN THE MOST RECENT FOUR-YEAR PERIOD, THE SAILOR SHALL 
BE RETAINED ONBOARD THE PRESENT COMMAND UNTIL COMPLETION OF OBLIGATED 
SERVICE OR EXPIRATION OF THE WAIVER.  IF THE SAILOR STILL HAS THREE OR 
MORE PFA FAILURES IN THE MOST RECENT FOUR-YEAR PERIOD UPON WAIVER 
EXPIRATION, COMMANDING OFFICERS SHALL INITIATE ADSEP PROCESSING.  PER 
REF A, COMMUNITY MANAGERS AND ECHELON III COMMANDERS MAINTAIN 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPROVAL AND DISPOSITION OF ALL READINESS WAIVERS.
     C.  COMMANDING OFFICERS SHALL NOT GRANT PROGRESS WAIVERS AFTER 30 
JUNE 2009, TO CORRESPOND WITH COMPLETION OF THE 2009 SPRING PFA CYCLE 1.  
SAILORS GRANTED A PROGRESS OR READINESS WAIVER SHALL SIGN A PAGE 13 
(NAVPERS 1070/613 ADMINISTRATIVE REMARKS) TO ACKNOWLEDGE UNDERSTANDING 
OF THE NO-TRANSFER RESTRICTION.  COMMANDS SHALL NOTIFY
PERS-4 BY NAVY MESSAGE TO ENSURE THE SAILOR'S DETAILER IS KEPT INFORMED 
OF THE SAILOR'S NO-TRANSFER STATUS.

DOCUMENTED IN PRIMS.  IN ALL CASES (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF APROVED BODY
COMPOSITION ASSESSMENT (BCA) WAIVERS), SAILORS MUST MEET BODY FAT 
STANDARDS TO PASS THE SEMI-ANNUAL REQUIREMENTS.  IF THE SAILOR IS 
UNABLE TO COMPLETE THE PFA DUE TO MEDICAL WAIVER, BCA DATA MUST BE 
ENTERED INTO PRIMS WITH THE APPROPRIATE WAIVER CODE.  SHOULD PERSONNEL 
EXCEED THE BCA SPECIFICATION OF REFERENCE B, WITHOUT AN APPROPRIATE 
WAIVER REGARDING BCA, THE PFA WILL BE JUDGED A FAILURE FOR THAT CYCLE.
     E.  SEMI-ANNUAL PFA CYCLES SHALL BE DEFINED AS:  1 JANUARY THROUGH
