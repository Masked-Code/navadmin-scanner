SUBJ/FY-20 ACTIVE-DUTY NUCLEAR LIMITED DUTY OFFICER IN-SERVICE PROCUREMENT 
BOARD//

REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/14DEC09//
AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1420.1B, ENLISTED TO OFFICER COMMISSIONING PROGRAMS 
APPLICATION ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces solicitation of applications from highly 
qualified and motivated E-6 through E-8 active duty nuclear- trained 
personnel for the FY-20 Nuclear Limited Duty Officer (LDO) Program.  Nuclear 
LDOs bring a variety of experience and unique perspectives into the wardroom 
from their enlisted service.  The Nuclear LDO career path provides additional 
leadership opportunities and enhances ability of a Sailor to contribute to 
the Navy.

2.  All time in service (TIS) requirements for the FY-20 Nuclear LDO In-
Service Procurement Board (ISPB) will be computed to
1 October 2019.  TIS requirement for the Nuclear LDO Program is
8-16 years, no TIS waivers will be considered.  A conditional release is not 
required for the Nuclear LDO Program.  Applications will not be accepted for 
nuclear Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) designator (7401).

3.  This NAVADMIN supplements reference (a).  Where conflicts with reference 
(a) exist, this NAVADMIN takes precedence.

4.  Updated policy guidance to reference (a)
    a.  All applicants for the Nuclear LDO program will complete only pages 
1, 2, 6, and 10 of the Officer Programs Application (OPNAV 1420/1) form.  
Other information applicants consider pertinent to their application not 
contained in the Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) of the member should 
be submitted as sequentially numbered enclosures to the application pages.  
The list of enclosures that was previously submitted on page 8 of the OPNAV
1420/1 application form is not required.  All enclosures should be annotated 
on the bottom right of each page with the last name of the applicant and 
"Enclosure X of Y" with X being the sequential number of the enclosure and Y 
being the total number of enclosures.  Latest LDO/CWO Eligibility Checklist 
should be included with applicable blocks filled out.
    b.  E6 applicants must submit a copy of their current E7 examination 
profile sheet showing CPO board eligibility as enclosure
(1) to their application.
    c.  Engineering Watch Supervisor (EWS) or Propulsion Plant Watch 
Supervisor (PPWS) qualification is required to apply for Nuclear LDO.  E6 
applicants must ensure that EWS or PPWS qualification is documented via 
evaluations, commanding officer (CO) endorsement, or enclosure.  As EWS/PPWS 
qualification is also a requirement for selection to CPO, selected CPOs and 
above do not need to submit this documentation.
    d.  Since the board will not have access to the 15 September 2018 CPO or 
15 November 2018 PO1 evaluations, COs are encouraged to discuss any 
highlights in the performance of the applicant since the last evaluation in 
their recommendation.
    e.  The CO endorsement must contain the following statement:
"Applicant meets all requirements outlined in OPNAVINST 1420.1B, NAVADMIN 
128/18, and the physical fitness standards of OPNAVINST 6110.1J."
    f.  The three-person interview appraisal board with associated appraisal 
sheets and medical documentation of color vision test are not required.  It 
is preferred that COs indicate the ranking among nuclear candidates from 
their command, even if one of one.
    g.  The CO endorsement should also clearly state the command and COs 
name/rank.
    h.  All Nuclear LDO applicant packages will be forwarded to Naval 
Reactors for technical review prior to presentation to the Nuclear LDO ISPB.
    i.  Sailors selected for Nuclear LDO will require a separate technical 
interview at Naval Reactors to receive a commission.
Those Sailors not successfully completing a final technical interview will 
maintain their enlisted status and will not be commissioned as LDOs.  
Additionally, these Sailors are ineligible to submit future applications to 
the Nuclear LDO program. Technical interviews will be scheduled by Nuclear 
Placement and Assignments
(PERS-422) and selectees notified via separate correspondence.

5.  The FY-20 Active-Duty Nuclear LDO ISPB will convene at a date to be 
determined in November 2018.  Applications must be received no later than 31 
August 2018.  Addendums will only be accepted to correct application errors 
and must be received no later than 31 October 2018.  Communication to the 
board must originate from the individual applicant.  Information received 
that is not under the cover letter of the applicant (e.g., third party 
correspondence) and endorsed by the command, or not received by the 
established deadline will not be presented to the board.  Electronic 
submission of applications and addendums is encouraged and preferred.  The 
time and date (Central Standard Time) received in the nukeldo(at)navy.mil 
inbox is the time and date used for deadline verification.
Applications that are mailed must be postmarked no later than
31 August 2018.  Addendums that are mailed must be postmarked no later than 
31 October 2018.
