RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces a pilot program for Senior Enlisted Advance 
to Position (SEA2P) designed to keep deploying units mission-ready by 
aggressively filling critical at-sea leadership billets.  The pilot program 
will convene a billet selection board consisting of senior representatives 
from Fleet and participating type commander (TYCOM) staffs to select those 
Sailors who are best and fully qualified to advance and fill specific 
priority sea billets.  The pilot includes the Nimitz Strike Group on the West 
Coast and the Bataan Amphibious Ready Group on the East Coast. Additionally, 
the pilot will include USS GEORGE WASHINGTON (CVN 73). Factors for 
consideration in determining best and fully qualified applicants include 
sustained superior performance, documented qualifications, platform 
experience, and potential to succeed in the billet.  Sailors selected must 
obligate service (OBLISERV) to complete 36 months in the SEA2P billet and 
will be permanently advanced upon reporting to their ultimate duty 
station.  This pilot will be limited to critical E8 and E9 sea billets and is 
separate from reference (a). 
 
2.  To be eligible for SEA2P, Sailors must have been selected or screened as 
a non-select for advancement to E8 or E9 by the respective fiscal year (FY) 
2023 selection boards, or be advancement-eligible for the respective FY-24 
boards in line with reference (b).  Time-in-rate (TIR) waivers will be 
approved for FY-24 advancement-eligible Sailors who are selected for 
SEA2P.  All Sailors selected for SEA2P billets should expect to receive 
permanent change of station (PCS) orders with a transfer date as early as  
30-45 days after selection.

    e.  30 Sep 22:  Second round of job listings will be announced. 
    f.  17 Oct 22:  Deadline to submit NAVPERS 1306/7 requests for second

4.  Eligibility: 
    a.  This NAVADMIN temporarily waives force management and distribution 
policies as set forth in references (c) through (e) for SEA2P selected 
Sailors.  Sailors that have pending or approved requests to transition to the 
Fleet Reserve who have not executed any portion of their retirement orders 
are eligible.  High year tenure (HYT) gates will be suspended during the 
application phase and HYT waivers will be automatically approved for the 
duration of PCS orders for those Sailors selected for SEA2P.  Sea shore flow 
policy guidelines are lifted during the period of the Sailors PCS orders. 
    b.  Applicants must have been selected or screened as a non-select by the 
FY-23 advancement selection boards or be advancement-eligible for the FY-24 
advancement selection boards.  This pilot program is open to Active Component 
Sailors only and does not apply to nuclear and special warfare community 
Sailors.  It is the responsibility of the member and their command to verify 
eligibility.  If selected for both SEA2P and advancement via a FY-23 
selection board, Sailors will advance by whichever method (SEA2P or normal 
advancement increment) occurs first. 
    c.  SEA2P applicants must sign (with witness), an administrative remarks 
(NAVPERS 1070/613) (permanent) in line with reference (g). Ensure the 
following statement is included:  *I understand that by submitting an 
application for consideration for Senior Enlisted Advancement-to-Position, I 
am certifying that I am assignable to any billets for which I applied and 
will execute orders to those billets when directed.* 
    d.  Commanding officers (CO) are not authorized to withhold from 
forwarding SEA2P NAVPERS 1306/7 requests solely based on lack of relief 
availability.  The Manning Control Authority will work with the Fleet 
readiness integrators to determine prioritization of backfills for losing 
commands. 
    e.  Gaining commands are not authorized to refuse to accept orders for 
SEA2P selected Sailors. 
    f.  Applicants must possess any required Navy enlisted classification 
(NEC) codes associated with the billet(s) for which they apply.  Waivers will 
be considered for applicants who have pre- requisite experience necessary to 
obtain required NECs and can do so while also meeting the required arrival 
date for the SEA2P billet. 
 
5.  Application.  SEA2P applications must be submitted in line with 
reference (g).  Applications must include: 
    a.  Completed NAVPERS 1306/7 indicating billet(s) being applied for (in 
rank order) and favorable endorsement of operational suitability by 
CO.  Applicants must verify that their application is clearly marked *FY-23 
Senior Enlisted Advancement-to-Position.*  For questions on how to complete a 
NAVPERS 1306/7 contact your command career counselor. 
    b.  Sailors selected for SEA2P must OBLISERV to serve 36 months in the 
SEA2P billet and will be exempt from TYCOM manning actions (operational 
holds, crossdecks, or diverts). 
 
6.  Billets available under SEA2P, along with associated rating, paygrade and 
NEC requirements, are delineated on the MyNavy HR website: 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Detailing/Enlisted/Detailing-
Marketplace/.

    a.  Applicants shall provide a prioritized ranking of all billets to 
which they are applying within the NAVPERS 1306/7 using the billet titles and 
locations listed on the MyNavy HR website. Applicants will only be considered 
for billets for which they apply and will not be subject to involuntary 
selection to any other SEA2P billets for which they may be qualified. 
    b.  Personnel with assignment restrictions such as exceptional family 
member, dual military, or overseas screening limitations shall only apply to 
billets for which they are eligible for assignment. 
    c.  Selectees must expeditiously complete operational screening in line 
with reference (f).  Commands should quickly elevate any barriers to meeting 
transfer timelines to their immediate superior in command/TYCOM and Navy 
Personnel Command.

31 Aug 2 (first round) and 17 Oct 22 (second round) for the selection 
boards.  It is not recommended that applications be submitted via mail.  If
