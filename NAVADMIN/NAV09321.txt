RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN SUMMARIZES NAVY'S ATTAINMENT OF FISCAL YEAR 2009
(FY-09) RETENTION OBJECTIVES AND OUTLINES THE FY-10 RETENTION 
ENVIRONMENT AND GOALS.  REFS A THRU I PROVIDE LEADERSHIP GUIDANCE 
IMPACTING RETENTION OPPORTUNITIES AND BEHAVIOR.

2.  NAVY EXCEEDED RETENTION GOALS ESTABLISHED FOR FY-09.  STRONG 
COMMAND AND DECKPLATE LEADERSHIP CONTRIBUTED TO NAVY ATTAINING
108 PERCENT OF OUR NUMERIC REENLISTMENT MISSION
(30,895 REENLISTMENTS COMPARED TO A GOAL OF 28,700) FOR SAILORS IN THE 
FIRST 14 YEARS OF SERVICE.  FY-09 ATTRITION RATES WERE ALSO LOWER WHEN 
COMPARED TO FY-08. A SUMMARY OF FY-09 RETENTION INCLUDES:
    A.  ALL-NAVY FY-09 REENLISTMENT RATE
                                       GOAL          ACTUAL
ZONE A (0 TO 6 YEARS OF SERVICE)       54 PERCENT    55.2 PERCENT
ZONE B (6 TO 10 YEARS OF SERVICE)      63 PERCENT    66.4 PERCENT
ZONE C (10 TO 14 YEARS OF SERVICE)     81 PERCENT    82.2 PERCENT
NOTE:  REENLISTMENT RATE MEASURES THE PROPORTION OF SAILORS WHO MAKE 
LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS (FORMAL REENLISTMENTS PLUS EXTENSIONS OF AT LEAST
24 MONTHS) TO STAY ON ACTIVE DUTY UPON REACHING THEIR EAOS.  IT ALSO 
INCLUDES THOSE WHO DECIDE TO REENLIST EARLY.
    B.  ALL-NAVY 12-MONTH ATTRITION RATE
             FY-07 ACTUAL     FY-08 ACTUAL    FY-09 ACTUAL
ZONE A       9.10 PERCENT     8.40 PERCENT    7.28 PERCENT
ZONE B       2.82 PERCENT     2.44 PERCENT    2.40 PERCENT
ZONE C       2.08 PERCENT     1.52 PERCENT    1.42 PERCENT
NOTE:  ATTRITION RATE MEASURES THE PERCENTAGE OF SAILORS WHO LEAVE 
ACTIVE DUTY PRIOR TO REACHING THEIR EAOS.

3.  LIKELY FACTORS THAT WILL SHAPE NAVY'S FY-10 RETENTION EFFORTS 
INCLUDE CHANGING ECONOMIC FACTORS, COMPETITION FROM CIVILIAN EMPLOYMENT, 
OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POST 
9/11 GI BILL.
IN FY-10, NAVY WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON SUSTAINING A HIGH PERFORMANCE 
FORCE IN ORDER TO MEET FUTURE FLEET AND RATING NEEDS THROUGH PERFORM-
TO-SERVE (PTS) AS WELL AS SRB AND OTHER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS.  EARLY 
SEPARATION AND SENIOR ENLISTED TIME-IN-GRADE WAIVER POLICIES CONTINUE 
WITH LIMITATIONS AS SPECIFIED IN REFS E AND F, RESPECTIVELY.  I HAVE 
SET THE FOLLOWING FY-10 RETENTION GOALS:
                                       FY-10 GOAL
ZONE A (0 TO 6 YEARS OF SERVICE)       55 PERCENT
ZONE B (6 TO 10 YEARS OF SERVICE)      60 PERCENT
ZONE C (10 TO 14 YEARS OF SERVICE)     71 PERCENT

4.  ACHIEVING FIT THROUGH RETENTION.  WE MUST CONTINUE TO SHAPE THE 
FORCE TO ACHIEVE THE BEST "FIT" OF SAILORS RANK/RATE/NEC IN RELATION TO 
OUR BILLET STRUCTURE.
ACHIEVING FIT THROUGH RETENTION MEANS MOVING BEYOND THE AGGREGATE 
REENLISTMENT RATE GOALS LISTED IN PARA 3 TOWARDS MEETING RETENTION 
REQUIREMENTS BASED ON RATING AND LENGTH OF SERVICE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THERE 
ARE SOME RATINGS THAT REQUIRE A ZONE A REENLISTMENT RATE OF MORE THAN 
80 PERCENT FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH; OTHERS CAN REMAIN HEALTHY WITH A 40 
PERCENT REENLISTMENT RATE.
COMMAND UNDERSTANDING OF THESE INDIVIDUAL GOALS IS ESSENTIAL IN 
INFLUENCING THE DESIRED REENLISTMENT BEHAVIOR FOR OUR MOST CRITICAL 
RATINGS.  TIMELY QUALIFICATION AND DESIGNATION OF OUR PROFESSIONAL 
APPRENTICESHIP CAREER TRACK (PACT) SAILORS IN FLEET RIDE IS ESSENTIAL 
TO ACHIEVING FIT.  IN ADDITION, ON-TIME SUBMISSION OF PERFORM TO SERVE 
(PTS) APPLICATIONS ENABLE PROACTIVE FORCE STABILIZATION MANAGEMENT.

5.  CURRENT RETENTION FIT INFORMATION FOR EACH RATING IS AVAILABLE ON 
THE ENLISTED RETENTION DASHBOARD LOCATED ON BUPERS ONLINE AT 
HTTPS://WWW.BOL.NAVY.MIL.
COMMANDING OFFICERS, OFFICERS-IN-CHARGE, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, COMMAND 
MASTER CHIEFS, AND COMMAND CAREER COUNSELORS CAN OBTAIN ACCESS TO THE 
ENLISTED RETENTION DASHBOARD BY SENDING AN EMAIL TO THE METRICS AND 
ANALYTICS BRANCH OF BUPERS-3 (BUPERS 34), MILITARY COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT.
