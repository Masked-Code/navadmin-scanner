SUBJ/ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RESTRICTED LINE RESERVE HUMAN RESOURCES 
COMMUNITY// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  NAVADMIN 182/01 ESTABLISHED THE ACTIVE DUTY 
RESTRICTED LINE HUMAN RESOURCES (HR) COMMUNITY (DESIGNATOR 1200) AND 
APPROVED THE STAND-UP OF A RESERVE HR COMMUNITY (DESIGNATOR 1205/1207).  
CONSISTENT WITH ONGOING ACTIVE/RESERVE INTEGRATION INITIATIVES AND THE 
REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE THE MANPOWER, PERSONNEL, TRAINING AND EDUCATION 
(MPT&E) ENTERPRISE WITH HR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS (SME), THE RESERVE HR 
COMMUNITY IS NOW ESTABLISHED.
OFFICERS OF THE UNRESTRICTED LINE FLEET SUPPORT COMMUNITY (DESIGNATION 
1105/1107) AND SPECIAL DUTY OFFICERS - RESERVE OFFICER RECRUITER 
(DESIGNATION 1687) WILL COMPRISE THE INITIAL
1205/1207 OFFICER INVENTORY.  RESERVE HR COMMUNITY OFFICERS, ALONG WITH 
THEIR ACTIVE COMPONENT COUNTERPARTS, WILL PLAN, PROGRAM AND EXECUTE 
LIFE-CYCLE MANAGEMENT OF THE NAVY'S MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE
- PEOPLE.  THEIR MISSION AND FUNCTIONS WILL ENCOMPASS THE SYNERGISTIC 
ELEMENTS OF MPT&E TO MEET THE GROWING REQUIREMENTS OF THE MPT&E 
ENTERPRISE AS AN ENABLING DOMAIN TO THE WAR FIGHTERS.
2.  BILLET SELECTION:  THE 185 BILLETS FOR THE 1205 AND 184 BILLETS FOR 
THE 1207 COMMUNITY WERE DERIVED FROM A COMBINATION OF EXISTING 
1105/1107/1687 AND 1000 CODED BILLET BASES AFTER EXTENSIVE REVIEW BY 
OFFICER COMMUNITY MANAGERS, MAJOR CLAIMANTS, RESOURCE SPONSORS, AND THE 
RESERVE HR COMMUNITY WORKING GROUP.  THESE BILLETS OPTIMALLY MATCH HR 
CORE COMPETENCIES IDENTIFIED WITH MPT&E COMMANDS.
A SMALL NUMBER OF 1050 BILLETS WITH HR CORE COMPETENCIES (E.G., 
ADMINISTRATION OFFICER) WILL ALSO BE APPROPRIATELY CONVERTED TO 120X.
3.  REDESIGNATION PROCEDURES:
    A.  ALL FULL TIME SUPPORT FSO'S (1107) AND RECRUITERS (1687) WILL 
AUTOMATICALLY BE REDESIGNATED TO 1207 UNLESS THE MEMBER INDICATES INTENT 
TO APPLY FOR REDESIGNATION TO ANOTHER COMMUNITY.
PROCEDURES ON HOW TO DECLARE INTENT WILL BE PROVIDED VIA SEPARATE 
CORRESPONDENCE.
    B.  THOSE 1687 OFFICERS WHO ELECTED THE HOMETOWN RECRUITER TRACK, 
AND WHO ARE WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF RETIREMENT ELIGIBILITY ON THE DATE OF 
THE DESIGNATOR CHANGE, WILL BE GRANDFATHERED AND ALLOWED TO REMAIN AT 
THEIR CURRENT DUTY STATION UNTIL RETIREMENT.
NO NEW HOMETOWN RECRUITERS WILL BE AUTHORIZED IN THE HR COMMUNITY.
    C.  ALL SELRES FSO (1105) RECORDS WERE REVIEWED BY A SPECIAL 
SCREENING PANEL IN DECEMBER 2006 FOR AUTOMATIC REDESIGNATION TO 1205 
WITH MEMBER APPROVAL.  ACQUIRED NOBCS, HR TOUR EXPERIENCE, AND POST 
GRADUATE EDUCATION RELEVANT TO THE MPT&E ENTERPRISE WERE THE PRIMARY 
CONSIDERATIONS FOR SELECTION.  THOSE OFFICERS NOT SELECTED FOR 
REDESIGNATION CAN APPLY TO THE RESERVE OFFICER REDESIGNATION REVIEW 
BOARD FOR HR, OPT TO APPLY FOR REDESIGNATION TO ANOTHER COMMUNITY, OR 
REMAIN IN THE 1105 DESIGNATOR UNTIL THEY REACH RETIREMENT ELIGIBILITY.  
MILPERSMAN 1212-010 PERTAINS.  OFFICERS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED VIA SEPARATE 
CORRESPONDENCE REGARDING THEIR REDESIGNATION SELECTION OR NONSELECTION 
STATUS.
    D.  SELRES FSO (1105) OFFICERS NOT PRE-SELECTED BY THE DECEMBER 
PANEL AND OFFICERS IN OTHER RESERVE DESIGNATORS WHO WISH TO REDESIGNATE 
TO THE HR COMMUNITY MUST APPLY FOR REDESIGNATION.
IF AN OFFICER CHOOSES TO REMAIN AN 1105 FSO, THEY MAY CONTINUE TO 
COMPETE FOR THE 1000 CODED BILLETS WHICH SUPPORT FLEET AND JOINT 
COMMANDS.  APPROPRIATE PRECEPT LANGUAGE FOR PROMOTION AND SELECTION 
BOARD MEMBERS WILL BE PROVIDED TO DESCRIBE THE UNIQUE SITUATIONS OF 
OFFICERS REMAINING AS PART OF THE UNRESTRICTED LINE.
    E.  EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY ACCESSIONS OR REDESIGNATIONS TO THE FSO 
COMMUNITY ARE NO LONGER AUTHORIZED.
4.  PROMOTION AND SENIOR COMMAND AND NON-COMMAND SELECTION BOARDS:
    A.  EFFECTIVE WITH THE FY09 PROMOTION CYCLE, THE RESERVE HR 
COMMUNITY WILL BE A SEPARATE PANEL AND COMPETITIVE CATEGORY IN THE 
RESTRICTED LINE.  APPROPRIATE PRECEPT LANGUAGE WILL BE PROVIDED TO BOARD 
MEMBERS.
    B.  EFFECTIVE FY07, THE RESERVE SENIOR COMMAND AND NON-COMMAND 
_APPLY_ SELECTION BOARD WILL REVIEW HR OFFICERS.  THOSE OFFICERS NOT 
SELECTED TO A 1205 BILLET WILL TRANSFER TO THE APPROPRIATE UNRESTRICTED 
LINE BOARD IN ORDER TO COMPETE FOR 1000 CODED BILLETS.
APPROPRIATE PRECEPT LANGUAGE WILL BE PROVIDED.
5.  THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE RESERVE FSO AND RECRUITING OFFICER CORPS 
TO THE RESERVE HR COMMUNITY WILL RESULT IN CHANGE FOR MANY OF OUR 
OFFICERS AND THE NAVY AS A WHOLE.  THIS IS A POSITIVE STEP TOWARDS 
STREAMLINING AND IMPROVING THE WAY WE PROVIDE SUPPORT AFLOAT AND CONDUCT 
BUSINESS ASHORE.
