SUBJ/ACADEMIC YEAR 2018-2019 NAVAL WAR COLLEGE FLEET SEMINAR PROGRAM//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the 43rd consecutive year of Joint 
Professional Military Education (JPME) for senior leaders.  The Naval War 
College (NWC) Fleet Seminar Program (FSP) offers intermediate level JPME 
(JPME-I) through a set of three courses: 
Strategy and War (S and W), Theater Security Decision Making (TSDM),
Joint Maritime Operations (JMO) and is offered at multiple locations in 
keeping with efforts of the Chief of Naval Personnel to foster a deliberate 
and flexible learning environment.  Each course normally requires one 
academic year to complete, which runs from September through the following 
May.  All three courses are not offered simultaneously at all locations.  
There is no tuition fee and course materials are provided on a loan basis at 
no cost to the students.

2.  The NWC FSP will be offered in nineteen regional locations in the United 
States for academic year 2018-2019.  Planned locations and courses are:

    a.  Annapolis, MD (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
    b.  Dahlgren, VA (S and W)
    c.  Everett, WA (JMO)
    d.  Fort Worth, TX (JMO)
    e.  Great Lakes, IL (S and W)
    f.  Jacksonville, FL (TSDM and JMO)
    g.  Kitsap, WA (S and W)
    h.  Mayport, FL (S and W)
    i.  Millington, TN (TSDM)
    j.  New Orleans, LA (S and W)
    k.  Newport, RI (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
    l.  Norfolk, VA (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
    m.  Patuxent River, MD (S and W)
    n.  Pearl Harbor, HI (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
    o.  Pensacola, FL (Whiting Field) (TSDM)
    p.  Port Hueneme, CA (JMO)
    q.  San Diego, CA (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
    r.  Washington, DC (S and W, TSDM and JMO)
    s.  Whidbey Island, WA (TSDM)

3.  FSP courses are similar in content and delivery methodology to the 
intermediate level program of study offered by the resident College of Naval 
Command and Staff in Newport, RI.  Seminars for each course meet once a week 
in the evening for approximately 34 weeks, commencing in early September 2018 
and ending in May 2019. Led by NWC adjunct faculty members and supported by 
visiting NWC faculty, these courses replicate both the content and atmosphere 
of the resident courses of study.  Successful completion of all three courses 
results in the award of a College of Naval Command and Staff diploma, as well 
as credit for JPME-I.  The FSP seminars at all locations are conducted in-
step with each other so it is possible for a student who is transferring to, 
or assigned temporary additional duty at, another seminar location to attend 
class at that location.

4.  NWC accepts program applications from commissioned officers (active and 
reserve) and civilian employees of the federal government, subject to the 
following eligibility requirements:
    a.  Members of the sea services (Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard) in 
the paygrade of O-3 or above, while officers from the other services must be 
in the paygrade of O-4 or above.  Civilian employees of the federal 
government in the grade of GS-11 and above, or equivalent, are also eligible 
for enrollment.
    b.  All applicants must have previously earned at least a baccalaureate 
degree.

5.  Qualified individuals currently stationed in areas listed in paragraph

are encouraged to apply.  More information is available and applications must 
be submitted at the NWC College of Distance Education FSP website at 
https://usnwc.edu/college-of-distance-education/Fleet-Seminar.  The

2018.  NWC will make enrollment selections and accepted applicants will be 
advised of their enrollment selection status by mid-June 2018.

of the day, plans of the week, base newspapers, base cable television and any 
other available appropriate media. Regional coordinators at the sites listed
