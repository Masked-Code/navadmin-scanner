REF/A/DOC/CHNAVPERS/4SEP12/NOTAL//
AMPN/REF A IS CHIEF OF NAVAL PERSONNEL MEMO FOR THE RECORD REGARDING TRAINING FOR 
SEXUAL ASSAULT INITIAL DISPOSITION AUTHORITY.// 

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the FY-14 schedule for the senior officer course.  The Naval Justice 
School has presented the senior officer course at worldwide locations since 1955.  Participants regularly 
give the course outstanding marks for increasing awareness of current legal issues and promoting 
efficiency in handling legal matters.  Per ref (a), the senior officer course is now required for all O6's en 
route to command.

2.  Naval Justice School has transitioned to the Enterprise Naval Training Reservation System (ENTRS) for 
all quota requests.  Course registrations will no longer be accepted via email, phone or fax.  
All quota requests should be made via the ENTRS system website at 
https://main.prod.cetars.training.navy.mil/cetars.  Select "request access" from the initial login screen 
and fill out the application.  
A web guide and user manual are available on the site.  Commands are responsible for system 
familiarization.  Applicants should ensure accuracy and completeness of data when completing the 
application.  
Incomplete or inaccurate data may result in disapproval of the request.

3.  Commanding officers, executive officers, and officers in charge are encouraged to attend at their 
earliest opportunity.  Other officers in paygrade O4 and above who have a mission-essential need for 
this training may attend on a space-available basis.  Officers for whom the class is mandatory have 
priority for quotas.  Officers having completed similar training in the past are encouraged to attend as a 
refresher.  Travel and per diem costs will be the responsibility of individual commands.  The course 
curriculum is based on familiarization with the Uniform Code of Military Justice, administrative fact-
finding bodies, administrative separation procedures, the court-martial process, and various other 
policies relating to command administration of legal matters.  This course is not a substitute for the 
Legal Officer Course (S-5F-0014), a three-week course for Command Legal Officers.
