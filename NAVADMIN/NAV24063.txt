3.  Each applicant should take pride in knowing that the superior performance 
documented in the evaluations reviewed by the board required the members to 
dedicate long hours in making hard choices to ensure only the best and fully 
qualified applicants were selected.  I am confident that each selectee will 
justify their selection time and again in their new career as naval officers.
Those not selected are highly encouraged to seek out an LDO/Chief Warrant 
Officer (CWO) in your area for advice on ways to grow professionally and 
improve opportunity for future selection.  Bravo Zulu to all who were willing 
to answer the call.

4.  This message is not authority to issue appointments.  Frocking is 
prohibited.  COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806) will deliver appointments to MyNavy 
Career Center (MNCC) Millington approximately 60 days prior to the 
commissioning date.  MNCC will forward appointments to the Transaction 
Service Center (TSC) Great Lakes, who will distribute directly to the 
respective CPPAs.  TSC Great Lakes will also process the conversion from 
enlisted to officer status for LDOs and CWOs, for all commands other than 
those who have the ability to process their own (CVN, SPECWAR, etc.).  TSC 
Great Lakes can be contacted directly at the below email address.

5.  Commanding Officers are directed to:
    a.  Notify selectee.
    b.  Notify PERS-803 via official correspondence no later than 10 days 
following release of this message of selectees who do not accept appointment.  
Selectees who decline their commission within this 10 day period will be 
considered by the FY-25 Enlisted Selection Boards.  After the 10 day period, 
PERS-802 will invalidate all FY-25 Active-Duty Navy Nuclear LDO ISP Selection 
Board selectees eligibility for the FY-25 Active-Duty Enlisted Selection 
Boards.
    c.  Per reference (a), ensure LDO selectees obtain a commissioning 
physical within 90 days preceding the appointment month.  Notify the Nuclear 
LDO detailer (PERS-422B) upon completion.
    d.  Hold execution of all permanent change of station orders in abeyance, 
if applicable, and immediately notify PERS-40 of member's selection.
    e.  Administer an official Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA) within four 
months of commissioning date.  Selectees must hand carry test results to 
Officer Indoctrination School, Newport, RI.  If selectee fails to achieve 
satisfactory medium, notify Nuclear LDO detailer (PERS-422B).  Hold 
commissioning in abeyance until successful completion of PFA.
    f.  Hold appointment in abeyance if it is determined that a selectee is 
no longer mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified or if 
they fail to meet current PFA requirements.  Immediately forward 
documentation citing reason to PERS-803.

6.  If a Nuclear LDO selectee's enlistment (including any
extensions) expires after the date of appointment, they are not reenlistment 
eligible unless appointment is declined.

7.  Each selectee should contact the Nuclear LDO officer detailer
(PERS-422B) for submission requirements in regards to personal information 
and history cards, and inform PERS-806 of address changes to facilitate 
appointment delivery.
