SUBJ/COAST GUARD BIRTHDAY MESSAGE
Rmks/1.  On behalf of the United States Navy, I extend my sincere 
appreciation to all Coast Guardsmen and their Families as they observe the 
225th birthday of the United States Coast Guard.

2.  Since 1790, you and your forbearers have provided security in the 
maritime domain of our homeland.  The challenges you encounter may change, 
but your tradition of excellence remains constant.

3.  The Navy and the Coast Guard stand together forward, engaged, and ready.  
Together we defend and protect the prosperity and maritime rights of the 
United States of America. Happy Birthday, Shipmates.  We are proud to serve 
alongside you.

4.  Released by Chief of Naval Operations.//
