RMKS/1.  A Flag/SES panel reviewed candidate nominations and selected the 
2015 Admiral Stan Arthur Award winners IAW Ref A.  This award recognizes 
military and civilian logisticians who epitomize excellence in logistics 
planning and execution.  I am pleased to announce the 2015 Admiral Stan 
Arthur Award winners:

    A.  2015 Military Logistician of the Year is LT Nathan Peck,
    Commander, United States Naval Forces Central Command, Task Force
    FIVE THREE (CTF 53) Surface Router.  In support of joint and
    combined operational units participating in FIFTH Fleet Maritime
    Security Operations, Operation INHERENT RESOLVE, and the Global War
    on Terrorism, LT Peck stepped in and filled the vacant operations
    department head position and expertly directed CTF 53s ability to
    plan and execute logistics evolutions in an extremely dynamic
    operating environment.  His careful scheduling enabled world class
    maintenance in support of sustainment at sea, and increased the
    warfighting readiness of both U.S. and coalition forces.  He created
    an innovative replenishment schedule that reduced Combat Logistics
    Force (CLF) fuel consumption and saved over $11M.  He also
    positively influenced a series of firsts in Combined Operations as
    he worked with embedded liaison officers from both France and the
    United Kingdom, culminating in the replenishment of a U.S. aircraft
    carrier by a French oiler, a first for both the U.S. and France.  He
    executed operational tactical command of French oilers FS MEUSE, FS
    MARNE, and U.K. oiler RFA FORT VICTORIA that were instrumental in
    the support of a relentless scheme of maneuver for U.S. Navy
    combatant units and coalition partners.
    
B.  2015 Civilian Logistician of the Year is Mr. Robert Boldin,
    Military Sealift Command, Fleet Logistics Officer.  He was
    instrumental in profoundly advancing the mission readiness of
    Hospital Ships USNS COMFORT (T-AH 20) and USNS MERCY (T-AH 19).  Mr.
    Boldin spearheaded the logistics sustainment planning and execution
    of the first-ever simultaneous deployments for two hospital ships in
    2015.  His exceptional effort leading several logistics teams across
    four areas of responsibility in CTF-83, FOURTH, THIRD, and SEVENT
    Fleets enabled the on-time rapid mobilization of both COMFORT and
    MERCY to support CONTINUING PROMISE and PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP 2015
    humanitarian deployments.  Mr. Boldin expertly conducted all
    activation and deactivation activities associated with standing up
    the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) and closing the operation down
    upon mission completion to include logistics planning, load out,
    sustainment, transportation, husbanding services, and record
    reconciliation; all of which became the standard end-to-end
    logistics playbook to efficiently support future deployment
    operations.
    
C.  2015 Logistics Team of the Year is Commander, United States
    Naval Forces Central Command, Task Force FIVE ONE (CTF 51),
    Logistics Operations (N4) Team.  The CTF 51 Logistics Operations
    Team overcame significant operational and logistical challenges to
    deliver unprecedented service and support to multiple operational
    units, made up of more than 16,000 Marines and Sailors across the
    FIFTH Fleet area of operations.  The N4 team initiated operational
    and supply chain efficiencies, thus increasing aviation and surface
    readiness in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.  Aligning the Navy
    Central Command strategic objectives outside the Arabian Gulf, this
    team executed a proof of concept validation for Duqm, Oman, as a
    Forward Logistics Site (FLS).  The N4 teams forward leaning
    sustainment and readiness posture enabled swift execution of
    emergent FIFTH Fleet crisis response events, and vital support to
    emerging national command authority strategic and operational
    objectives in the region.

2.  A virtual awards ceremony, via video teleconference, with ADM Arthur, USN 
(Retired), VADM Cullom, and the winning members commands is scheduled for 
later this summer.  OPNAV POC will contact winning commands to make 
arrangements for the ceremony.

3.  My heartiest congratulations to the winners!  Your superlative innovative 
solutions resulted in quantifiable benefits to the United States Navy and 
enhanced the logistics profession.  BRAVO ZULU!
