SUBJ/SALUTES AND HONORS TO THE NATIONAL FLAG//
REF/A/DOC/U.S. NAVY REGULATIONS, 1990//
REF/B/DOC/OPNAVINST/15JUN01//
NARR/REF A IS U.S. NAVY REGULATIONS, 1990. REF B IS OPNAVINST
1710.7A, NAVY SOCIAL USAGE AND PROTOCOL MANUAL.//
RMKS/1.  THE INTENT OF THIS NAVADMIN IS TO ELIMINATE ANY CONFUSION 
REGARDING APPROPRIATE HONORS TO THE FLAG BY NAVY PERSONNEL.  BY
CUSTOM AND TRADITION, NAVY PERSONNEL DO NOT RENDER THE HAND SALUTE WHEN 
OUT OF UNIFORM OR WHEN UNCOVERED; THAT HAS NOT CHANGED.
2.  DURING THE PLAYING OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, OR THE RAISING, 
LOWERING, OR PASSING OF THE NATIONAL FLAG, SAILORS WILL CONTINUE TO 
FOLLOW THE POLICY AND PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN REF B.  SPECIFICALLY, 
SAILORS NOT IN UNIFORM WILL FACE THE FLAG, STAND AT ATTENTION, AND 
PLACE THE RIGHT HAND OVER THE HEART.  IF COVERED, SAILORS NOT IN 
UNIFORM WILL REMOVE THEIR HEADGEAR WITH THE RIGHT HAND AND PLACE
THEIR RIGHT HAND OVER THEIR HEART.  WHEN THE FLAG IS NOT PRESENT, 
SAILORS WILL ACT IN THE SAME MANNER WHILE FACING THE DIRECTION OF THE 
MUSIC.
3.  IN CASES SUCH AS INDOOR CEREMONIES, WHEN SAILORS ARE IN UNIFORM 
AND UNCOVERED, THEY WILL FACE THE FLAG OR THE DIRECTION OF THE MUSIC 
WHEN THE FLAG IS NOT PRESENT, AND STAND AT ATTENTION.
4.  OUR SHARP APPEARANCE - IN AND OUT OF UNIFORM - IS A REFLECTION OF
OUR COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE IN SERVICE.  OUR PRIDE IN THAT SERVICE AS 
MEMBERS OF THE WORLD'S FINEST NAVY SHOULD SHINE THROUGH IN ALL THAT WE 
DO.  LEAVE NO ONE TO DOUBT THE SERIOUSNESS OF OUR COMMITMENT OR THE 
DEPTH OF OUR PRIDE.
5.  FILE AND RETAIN THIS INTERIM CHANGE WITH REF B UNTIL THESE
CHANGES HAVE BEEN FORMALLY INCORPORATED VIA INSTRUCTION REVISION. 
6.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
