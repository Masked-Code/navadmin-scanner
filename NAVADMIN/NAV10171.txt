NARR/REF A IS NAVADMIN 160/08, DESIGNATES UNITED STATES FLEET FORCES (USFF) AS 
EXECUTIVE AGENT AND SUPPORTED COMMANDER FOR INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE (IA) AND IA 
FAMILY SUPPORT ACROSS THE IA CONTINUUM.  REF B IS NAVADMIN 147/07, INTRODUCED 
THE GSA PROGRAM.//

RMKS/1.  THE ONLY CORRECTION TO THIS NAVADMIN IS CORRECTING THE NUMBERING IN 
THE SUBJECT LINE.  NO OTHER CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE.  AS PART OF OUR CONTINUED 
EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE (IA) PROCESS, THIS NAVADMIN 
ANNOUNCES A NEW PROGRAM FOR VOLUNTARY ENLISTED IA ASSIGNMENTS IN SUPPORT OF 
OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS (OCO) WHICH BETTER ENABLES SAILORS TO PLAN 
THEIR CAREER WHILE PROVIDING THE PREDICTABILITY AND STABILITY NECESSARY TO 
FOCUS ON THE MISSION.  THE OCO SUPPORT ASSIGNMENT (OSA) PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO 
PRESERVE THE CAREER CHOICES, VOLUNTEERISM, AND PREDICTABILITY THAT GSA NOW 
PROVIDES.  OSA ELIMINATES THE ENTITLEMENT INEQUITY DURING THE INCONUS PORTION 
OF IA ASSIGNMENTS, IMPROVES FLEET READINESS AND SOLIDIFIES SAILOR AND FAMILY 
SUPPORT.  WE ANTICIPATE THE WORLD-WIDE NEED FOR SAILORS TO SERVE IN NON-
TRADITIONAL, OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL MORE 
YEARS, AND MOST SAILORS SHOULD EXPECT TO SERVE IN SUPPORT OF OCO AT SOME POINT 
IN THEIR CAREER.  THE ENLISTED OSA PROGRAM AFFORDS SAILORS THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS THAT DETERMINES WHEN AND WHERE THEY WILL DEPLOY IN 
SUPPORT OF OCO.

2.  OSA IS FOR ACTIVE DUTY ENLISTED SERVICE MEMBERS AND WILL SUPERSEDE 
ENLISTED GSA STARTING IN FALL 2010.  OFFICERS WILL CONTINUE TO SATISFY IA 
TASKING THROUGH THE GSA PROCESS.

3.  BEGINNING FALL 2010, TO APPLY FOR AN IA OSA ASSIGNMENT, SAILORS WILL HAVE 
THE ABILITY TO GO ONLINE IN CMS/ID AND CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN AN "OSA 
ASSIGNMENT" VIA THE SPECIAL PROGRAMS TAB OF THE PREFERENCE PAGE.  THIS SHOULD 
BE DONE WHEN THEY ARE IN THE 12 TO 10 MONTH WINDOW BEFORE THEIR PROJECTED 
ROTATION DATE (PRD) AND PRIOR TO NEGOTIATING ORDERS WITH THEIR DETAILER.  
AFTER SELECTING OSA, THE SAILOR WILL BE CONTACTED BY THE OSA DETAILING TEAM 
(RESIDENT IN THE ENLISTED ASSIGNMENTS DIVISION OF PERS-4) THAT WILL ASSIST AND 
OFFER DETAILED BILLET INFORMATION REGARDING OSA OPPORTUNITIES.  LIKE GSA, OSA 
ORDERS WILL BE EXECUTED AT THE END OF THE SAILOR'S NORMAL PCS TOUR; HOWEVER, 
OSA ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE TEMPORARY ADDITIONAL DUTY (TEMADD) FROM THE EXISTING 
COMMAND SO THAT THE SAILOR (AND FAMILY) WILL MAINTAIN THE TRADITIONAL PARENT 
COMMAND RELATIONSHIP FOR SAILOR AND FAMILY SUPPORT.  TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, IF A 
SAILOR ELECTS AND IS ACCEPTED FOR AN OSA, THEY WILL BE ADMINISTRATIVELY 
EXTENDED AT THEIR PRESENT DUTY STATION FOR THE PERIOD OF THE IA PLUS AN 
ADDITIONAL 60 DAYS.
THE 60 DAYS WILL ALLOW REST AND RELAXATION, PCS MOVE PREPARATION, ETC.  
STANDARD RELIEF REQUISITION PROCEDURES WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT TO GENERATE A 
REQUISITION FOR THAT SAILOR AT THEIR ORIGINAL PRD.  ALTHOUGH THE SAILOR WILL 
REMAIN ASSIGNED TO THE PARENT COMMAND, PROCEDURES ARE IN PLACE TO ADJUST 
PERSONNEL ACCOUNTING SO THAT THE SAILOR WILL REFLECT AS AN IA, RATHER THAN 
ONBOARD, THUS GENERATING A VALID REQUISTION FOR A REPLACEMENT.

4.  NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND AND USFF (ALONG WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS) ARE WORKING 
TO UPDATE EXISTING IA PUBLICATIONS AND WEBSITES IN ANTICIPATION OF QUESTIONS 
THAT MAY ARISE.  THE PLANNED ROLLOUT FOR THIS CHANGE IS OCTOBER 2010.  A 
COMPREHENSIVE BUSINESS RULES NAVADMIN WILL BE RELEASED IN JULY.

5.  SINCE THIS IS A NEW PROCESS, I URGE YOU TO DISSEMINATE THIS INFORMATION TO 
YOUR COMMAND, SUBORDINATE COMMANDS, COMMAND IA COORDINATORS, OUR SAILORS  AND 
THEIR FAMILIES.

6. RELEASED BY VADM MARK FERGUSON, N1.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.//
