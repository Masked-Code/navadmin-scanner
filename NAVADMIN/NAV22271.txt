SUBJ/NAVAL INSPECTOR GENERAL MONTHLY REPORTING REQUIREMENT 
 
RMKS/1.  In order to enhance Navy Inspector General (IG) professionalization, 
enterprise excellence and internal IG Enterprise transparency, the Naval 
Inspector General (NAVIG) is initiating a formal NAVIG monthly reporting 
requirement.  This information is typically not available by other automated 
means and in many cases is already being reported to the IG's commander. 
 
2.  This NAVADMIN formalizes the reporting requirement and leverages the 
authority designated by Secretary of the Navy for managing IG 
matters.  Request all Commanders who employ IGs acknowledge receipt via their 
IGs. 
 
3.  For reporting, Commanders who employ IGs will submit monthly reports via 
the Naval Inspector General SharePoint portal under "Monthly Required 
Reporting (MRR)" tab between the 15th and end of each month.  The reporting 
topics are: 
    External Entity Oversight 
    High Visibility Issues 
    Workforce Reductions/Attrition 
    Certification Status 
    Upcoming Inspections Schedule 
    Significant Inspection Findings 
    Command Directed Inquiries (CDIs) 
    Media communications/contacts 
 
4.  NAVIG will send a separate email directly to Navy Enterprise IGs to 
provide additional reporting instructions. 
 
5.  Released by Mr. Andrew S. Haeuptle, Director, Navy Staff on behalf of 
Vice Admiral John Fuller, Naval Inspector General (NAVIG).
