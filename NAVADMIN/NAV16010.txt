RMKS/1.  Ref (a) is amended to include the following change in inactivation 
dates for FY16:

Ship Name		Projected Inactivation Date 	Post Inactivation Status
USS ALBUQUERQUE  (SSN 706)	 03 Feb 2016		      Dismantlement
USS CITY OF CORPUS CHRISTI (SSN 705) 29 Jun 2016	      Dismantlement
USS HOUSTON (SSN 713)		   29 Jun 2016			Dismantlement

2.  The projected inactivation date and post inactivation status for USNS 
RAINER remain unchanged, ref (a) is germane.

3.  The revised projected FY16 ship inactivation schedule for inactivating 
U.S. battle force and non-battle force naval vessels is promulgated as 
follows to facilitate fleet planning efforts to conduct decommissioning 
continuous maintenance availability (CMAV) or inactivation availability 
(INAC).

4.   For the purposes of this revised NAVADMIN, inactivation dates projected 
in para 1 refer to the start of an INAC for nuclear vessels, when the vessels 
are no longer counted as part of the Navy’s battle force.    Decommissioning 
will occur at a later date and be reported to CNO IAW ref (b).

5.  Per refs (b) and (c), Fleet Commanders shall submit an Organizational 
Change Request (OCR) to formally notify the Director, Navy Staff of para 1 
ships inactivation effective date.   A revised OCR shall be submitted to 
adjust the effective date (by 60 days or more) due to operational schedule 
changes.   It is the responsibility of Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command 
(USFFC) and Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CPF) in coordination with their 
respective TYCOM to ensure the appropriate lower echelon commands are 
notified of any changes in the ship inactivation schedules, as well as OPNAV 
N9I and OPNAV resource sponsor.

6.  Adjustments to para 1 ship inactivations that cross the current fiscal 
year must be coordinated with OPNAV N9I due to reporting requirements that 
Navy must inform Congress on execution year force structure changes that 
differ from what Congress authorized/appropriated and signed into law by the 
President.  OPNAV shall promulgate changes to the inactivation fiscal year as 
required.

7.  Ship commanding officers, masters, and officers in charge for all ships, 
shall submit a final naval message (normally transmitted in conjunction with 
the decommissioning ) announcing  the ships official retirement date and 
include a brief history of the significant events in the life of the ship per 
ref (b).  The Naval History and Heritage Command (NAVHISTHERITAGE WASHINGTON 
DC) and Naval Vessel Register Custodian (NVR NORFOLK VA) shall be included as 
INFO addees.

8.  Released by Mr. Brian J. Persons, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, 
Warfare Systems (N9).//
