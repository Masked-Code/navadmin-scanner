2.  The Lateral Transfer/Redesignation board is extremely competitive.  
Each record that is presented to the board is carefully reviewed and 
the best and most fully qualified are chosen. 

3.  Quota constraints for junior year groups (06 through 10) were 
especially tight thus the demand signal far exceeded the supply pool.  
Many quality applicants were identified by the board but could not 
be selected due to quota constraints of either outgoing community or 
gaining community.  Therefore, not being selected for this board is 
not a reason to feel that you have no future chance.  You should 
apply again (and again as required), all the while sustaining 
superior performance and bolstering your record for your desired 
community.  What makes your record standout is motivation towards 
your gaining community as well as continued promotability. 

4.  As always, competition for redesignation was keen and every 
community had a pool of highly qualified candidates.  Eligible 
officers not initially selected, and who did not specifically 
request not to be reviewed by communities other than their first or 
second choice, were subsequently reviewed by all other communities.  
Those officers tentatively selected for communities not initially 
requested will be notified via official correspondence and offered 
the opportunity to redesignate.

5.  This msg is not authority to deliver change of designator 
letters to the selectee.
    a.  Officers who are promotion selectees should contact their 
current detailer to discuss redesignation timing.  COMNAVPERSCOM 
(PERS-803), upon notification by COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4) that the 
selectee has been made available to their new community, will forward 
a redesignation letter to the selectee or appointment acceptance 
and oath of office (NAVPERS 1000/4), as applicable.
    b.  Officers who are not promotion selectees and who are not 
under orders can expect assignment to a new billet appropriate to 
their new designation when notified by COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4).
    c.  If a member is currently under orders and transfers prior to
notification by COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4), member must execute orders 
under current designator and must complete 12 months at the new 
assignment, unless a shorter tour is prescribed (tours in excess of 
one year will be with the concurrence of the gaining community), 
prior to redesignation.

6.  The following are exceptions to the above:
    a.  Surface Warfare (11xx) Officers who are under orders to 
department head school may not lateral transfer until completion of 
initial department head tour. 
    b.  Aviation Officers (1310 and 1320) shall not be permitted to 
lateral transfer until completion of active duty service obligation 
and/or expiration of aviation career continuation pay contract.  
Aviation Officers (1310 and 1320) in operational flying billets 
(billet designator XXX1 or XXX2) will not normally be permitted to 
redesignate until planned rotation date (PRD). PERS-43 is the final 
approval authority on the above constraints.
    c.  Applicants for 1510 who are presently designated 131x or 132x 
and a second sea tour or aviation department head tour has not been 
completed, assignment to 1510 billets may be delayed until the 
completion of applicable second sea and/or aviation department head 
tour, as determined by COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-43).

7.  Commanding Officer shall:
    a.  Ensure officers selected for promotion within their current 
community do not accept redesignation before their promotion date.
    b.  Notify COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-803) within 30 days of release of 
this message of selectees who do not desire to accept transfer/ 
redesignation.

8.  The next Transfer/Redesignation Board will be held on 2 June 2014.
Applications must be received by 4 April 2014.  Previous applications 
are not retained, non-selectees from previous boards must submit a new 
application for consideration.  A future NAVADMIN will stipulate all 
of the eligibility requirements and application procedures IAW refs 
(a) through (d).
