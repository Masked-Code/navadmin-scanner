SUBJ/UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS BIRTHDAY 2010// 

RMKS/1.  ON BEHALF OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY, I 
EXTEND A HAPPY 235TH BIRTHDAY TO THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS.

2.  AS YOU CELEBRATE ANOTHER BIRTHDAY, YOU CAN BE PROUD OF THE STRENGTH 
YOU HAVE SHOWN THROUGHOUT OUR NATION'S HISTORY IN FACING THE CHALLENGES 
POSED BY THOSE WHO WOULD THREATEN OUR SECURITY.  YOUR ACTIONS THIS YEAR 
- IN IRAQ, IN AFGHANISTAN, AT SEA IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND BEYOND - ADD A 
GLORIOUS CHAPTER TO A LONG LEGACY OF TAKING THE FIGHT TO OUR ADVERSARIES 
WHEREVER WE MIGHT ENCOUNTER THEM.

3.  IN TODAY'S INTERCONNECTED WORLD, WHERE INTERNATIONAL EVENTS HIT HOME 
MORE FREQUENTLY AND POWERFULLY THAN EVER BEFORE, THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT 
THAT GLOBAL DEMAND WILL GROW FOR THE AMERICAN LEADERSHIP OUR NAVY AND 
MARINE CORPS TEAM PROVIDES.  ALONG WITH THOSE OF OUR ALLIES, YOUR 
EFFORTS HAVE HELPED US PROMOTE GLOBAL MARITIME SECURITY, STABILITY, AND 
PROSPERITY.  TOGETHER, IN MISSIONS RANGING FROM HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 
TO POWER PROJECTION ASHORE, OUR TEAMWORK REPRESENTS THE MOST FLEXIBLE 
OPTION IN OUR NATION'S FORMIDABLE ARSENAL.

4.  TODAY, WE TAKE A MOMENT TO CELEBRATE THOSE MARINES AND THEIR 
FAMILIES WHO PAID THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE IN DEFENSE OF OUR NATION.
MARINES TODAY HONOR THEIR MEMORY WITH THE SAME WARFIGHTING SPIRIT YOU 
HAVE ALWAYS SHOWN IN FORGING THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD'S INDISPENSABLE 
EXPEDITIONARY TEAM.  THE NAVY IS AS PROUD AS EVER TO SERVE ALONGSIDE 
YOU.

5.  THANK YOU FOR ANOTHER YEAR OF UNRIVALED SERVICE IN DEFENSE OF OUR 
GREAT NATION.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MARINES.

6.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.//
