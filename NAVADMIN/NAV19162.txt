RMKS/1.  As we continue towards the ultimate goal of a Detailing Marketplace, 
this NAVADMIN announces a continuation of the pilot program, introduced in 
reference (a) for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Senior Enlisted Advancement-to-
Position Selection Board.  The purpose of the selection board is to fill 
priority E-8 and E-9 billets via a temporary advancement as an incentive.  
The selection board is separate from the annual advancement boards executed 
under reference (b).  The selection board will carefully consider, without 
prejudice or partiality, the record of every qualified applicant and select 
those Sailors who are best and fully qualified to fill priority billets 
across the Navy.  Factors for consideration in determining best and fully 
qualified applicants include sustained superior performance, documented 
qualifications, platform experience and potential to succeed in the specified 
priority billet(s).
Sailors selected by the selection board will be temporarily advanced to the 
pay grade associated with the authorized billet and receive pay commensurate 
with that pay grade upon reporting to their ultimate duty station.  To be 
permanently advanced, Sailors must still be selected for the next pay grade 
by a regularly scheduled Active-Duty senior chief petty officer (SCPO) or 
master chief petty officer (MCPO) selection board.  This temporary 
advancement will not affect eligibility for those annual advancement boards, 
but the SCPO and MCPO selection board precepts and convening orders will 
stipulate that personnel who demonstrate exceptional performance in an 
advancement-to-position billet will be given favorable consideration.  If a 
Sailor transfers from a temporary-advanced billet for any reason prior to 
being permanently selected for the next pay grade, the Sailor will revert 
back to their permanent pay grade effective the date of the transfer.  
Sailors selected for advancement-to-position billets should expect to receive 
permanent change of station orders with a transfer date approximately 90 days 
after the release of selection board results.

2.  Eligibility.
    a.  Applicants must meet all eligibility requirements for the regularly 
scheduled FY-20 Active-Duty SCPO or MCPO Selection Board in line with 
references (b) and (c).  The selection board is open to Active Component 
Sailors only.  It is the responsibility of the Sailor and command to verify 
eligibility.  Sailors selected for advancement via the FY-20 Active-Duty SCPO 
or MCPO Selection Boards are not eligible for the FY-20 Senior Enlisted 
Advancement-to- Position Selection Board.
    b.  Applicants must sign, and have their commanding officer (CO) witness,
