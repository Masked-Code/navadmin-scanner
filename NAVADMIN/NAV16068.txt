RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the results of the FY-16 Enlisted to Medical 
Degree Preparatory Program (EMDP2) from reference (a), which solicited 
applications for the FY-16 EMDP2.

2.  As outlined in reference (b), EMDP2 is a 2-year undergraduate education 
program open to enlisted personnel of all ratings who meet eligibility 
requirements.  The EMDP2 is a partnership between the Uniformed Services 
University of Health Science (USUHS) and the armed services to provide an 
opportunity for highly-motivated, academically-promising enlisted Service 
Members.  The EMDP2 consists of intensive coursework, preparation, and 
mentoring to prepare students for application to medical school.  Upon 
completion of the program, successful students will be competitive for 
acceptance to U.S. medical schools.

3.  Congratulations to the following individuals who were selected to 
participate in the EMDP2 beginning in August 2016:

receive permanent change of station orders (PCS) to USUHS and all school 
expenses (i.e., books, tuition, labs, etc.) will be paid by USUHS for the 
entire length of the course.  EMDP2 participants who complete program 
requirements but fail to obtain acceptance to a medical school, or who are 
disenrolled from the program, will be detailed at the discretion of the Navy 
Personnel Command.

5.  Commanding officers are directed to:
    a.  Notify selectees.

    d.  Notify the enlisted community manager of members selection.
    e.  Ensure selectees obligate service for 60 months from the convening 
date of the program, per reference (c).

6.  Many superb applications were reviewed by the selection board and

common characteristics in their application packages as observed by the 
selection board:
    a.  Met 100 percent of all submission requirements.
    b.  High cumulative grade point average.
    c.  Strong, authentic commanding officer endorsement.
    d.  Compelling appraisal recommendations.
    e.  Demonstrated sustained superior and academic performance in the
