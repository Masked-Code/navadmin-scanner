RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the solicitation of applications from highly 
qualified and motivated E-6 through E-9 Reserve Sailors for the Fiscal Year 
(FY) 2022 Navy Selected Reserve Limited Duty Officer (LDO) and Chief Warrant 
Officer (CWO) Programs.  Where conflicts with reference (a) exist, this 
NAVADMIN takes precedence.

2.  The FY-22 Navy Selected Reserve LDO and CWO In-Service Procurement Board 
(ISPB) will consider candidates for the following officer designators:  623X, 
626X, 628X, 629X, 633X, 641X, 649X, 653X, 711X, 712X, 713X, 715X, 716X, 717X, 
781X, 782X and 783X.
Eligible Sailors are encouraged to apply for the designators for which they 
are most qualified, regardless of current rating.  Refer to references (a) 
and (b) for eligibility criteria.

3.  Updated policy guidance to reference (a).
    a.  Time-in-service (TIS) for the FY-22 Navy Selected Reserve LDO and CWO 
ISPB must be computed to 1 October 2021.  In line with references (a) and 
(b), TIS is synonymous with years of qualifying service toward a non-regular 
(Reserve) retirement.
    b.  TIS eligibility is 8 to 14 years for LDO and 14 to 20 years for CWO.  
However, TIS waivers will be considered and adjudicated on a case-by-case 
basis by the office for Military Personnel Plans and Policy (OPNAV N13).  
Potential applicants outside of the TIS eligibility window are encouraged to 
contact the Reserve LDO/CWO Officer Community Manager (OCM) in paragraph 11 
of this NAVADMIN to discuss TIS waiver opportunities.  All LDO applicants 
must be able to serve at least 6 years of qualifying service and complete 20 
years of qualifying service prior to age 62.  All CWO applicants must be able 
to complete 20 years of qualifying service prior to reaching 62 years of age.  
Applicants must also not reach or exceed their high year tenure for their 
present pay grade within the calendar year the application is submitted.
    c.  In line with reference (b), all LDO applicants must include a 
statement in the personal statement section (paragraph 2) of the application, 
agreeing to further service, as follows:  *I, [name], if selected for 
permanent appointment under the Navy Reserve LDO Program, agree to accept 
such appointment and further agree to remain in the Ready Reserve for a 
period of 3 years after I accept such appointment.*
    d.  In line with reference (b), all CWO applicants must include a 
statement in the personal statement section (paragraph 2) of the application, 
agreeing to further service, as follows:  *I, [name],
if selected for permanent appointment under the Navy Reserve 	CWO
Program, agree to accept such appointment and further agree to remain in the 
Ready Reserve for a period of 6 years after I accept such appointment.*
    e.  Commanding Officer (CO)/Officer-in-Charge (OIC) endorsement must 
contain the following statement:  *Applicant meets all requirements outlined 
in OPNAVINST 1420.1B, OPNAVINST 1120.12A, NAVADMIN 162/20 and the physical 
fitness standards of OPNAVINST
6110.1J.*  COs should indicate the ranking among candidates from their 
command, even if 1 of 1.  The endorsement should also clearly state the 
command and COs name and rank.

4.  First class petty officers serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Horn of 
Africa that are determined chief petty officer board eligible in line with 
reference (c), are also eligible for LDO if all other eligibility 
requirements are met.

5.  Interview appraisal boards shall be constructed and approved by the 
CO/OIC and consist of only 3 Selected Reserve or active component officers.  
LDOs or CWOs should be utilized as board members to the maximum extent 
possible.  The senior member of the interview panel should be a lieutenant 
commander or above.  Every effort must be made to ensure at least one board 
member is from the designator for which the applicant is applying (including 
but not limited to teleconference, video teleconference, defense connect 
online, etc.).  Minimum grade requirements for board members are lieutenant 
junior grade or CWO2.  CWO2 panel members must have at least 2 years time in 
grade.  The interviewing board should, whenever possible, be comprised of 
officers who are not in the applicants command or at least not directly in 
the chain of command.
If it is not possible to assemble a panel of three officers, the interviews 
may be conducted separately.  Only three interview appraisals must be 
submitted for each applicant.  The potential block on interview appraisals 
must be marked for LDO and CWO candidates.  Only the current version of the 
interviewer appraisal sheet will be accepted.  Follow the instructions in 
paragraph 10 to download the most current interviewer appraisal sheet.
    a.  The CO of either Sea, Air and Land Team 17 or 18 is a required 
interview appraisal board member for both the 715X and 717X designators.
    b.  All applicants applying to the 715X designator must hold NEC O26A or 
O23A.  All applicants applying to the 717X designator must hold NEC O52A.

6.  Applicants currently serving on IA/GSA may have their application 
endorsed by their field commander.  All applications endorsed by field 
commanders must also obtain their parent command concurrence.  Follow the 
instructions in paragraph 10 to download a sample addendum letter.

7.  Applicants must ensure copies of the most recent periodic evaluation are 
included in the application or subsequent addendum for board review and 
continuity.  First class petty officers must submit their 15 November 2020 
evaluation via addendum if it is not already reflected in their official 
military personnel file.

8.  Applicants must maintain eligibility throughout the selection and 
commissioning process.  Applicants that are deemed ineligible after the 
submission of applications must be declared ineligible by their current CO, 
field commander (if on an IA) or parent command CO.  Follow the instructions 
in paragraph 10 to download a sample letter of abeyance or removal of 
recommendation memo.

9.  The FY-22 Navy Selected Reserve LDO and CWO ISPB will convene at a date 
to be determined in calendar year 2021.  For the most current board dates,

member.  Information received that is not under the applicants cover letter 
(e.g., third party correspondence) and endorsed by the command or not 
received by MNCC by the established
deadline(s) will not be presented to the board.  The time and date (central 
standard time) received in the MNCC inbox via e-mail is the time and date 
used for deadline verification.  Although a late submission may be accepted 
by MNCC, it will not be presented to the board.  All applications or 
addendums must have the full social security number of the Service member on 
each page.  Electronic and hard copy addendums must include a command
