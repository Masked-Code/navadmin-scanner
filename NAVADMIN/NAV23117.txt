AMPN/REF A IS MILPERSMAN ARTICLE 1001-020, FULL-TIME SUPPORT OF THE 
NAVY RESERVE OFFICER PROGRAM.// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN message announces the establishment of the 
Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) Permanent 
Professional Recruiter (PPR) Officer Designator 1287 within the 
restricted line. 
 
2.  TAR PPR community establishment is a major milestone in 
supporting the Navy Reserve recruiting community and will help 
ensure Navy Reserve recruiting develops key relationships within 
communities to establish market penetration in an increasingly 
challenging recruiting environment.  PPRs will provide established 
recruiting expertise with consistent corporate knowledge for the 
Navy Reserve, maintain historical knowledge, and facilitate seamless 
communication in a designated geographical location to deliver 
recruiting support.  Developing the Navy Reserve PPR community is 
critical to supporting Navy Reserve recruiting and directly 
affecting warfighting readiness. 
 
3.  PPRs will be assigned to specified geographic locations as 
determined by Navy Recruiting Command based on Reserve Component 
market data. 
 
4.  The PPR community will build its officer inventory by selecting 
officers each year through the semi-annual TAR officer transfer and 
redesignation board process.  Qualified officers are encouraged to 
apply for transfer or redesignation into the PPR community through 
this process.  Future NAVADMINs will announce the dates for upcoming 
transfer boards, associated requirements, and application deadlines. 
Reference (a) provides more detailed information about the PPR 
designator.

Officer Community Manager, at (901) 874-4346 or via e-mail
