SUBJ/2013 OMBUDSMAN APPRECIATION DAY//

RMKS/1. 14 September 2013 marks the 43rd anniversary of the Navy Family 
Ombudsman Program. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of the 
dedicated volunteer Navy Ombudsmen worldwide for their tireless support.

2. Ombudsmen are always on watch and serve as vital liaisons between 
leadership and families. They are a critical conduit between Sailors and Navy 
civilians driving focus on the mission and to always be ready. With the 
multitude of challenges that Sailors and families face, their role is more 
important than ever maintaining mission and family readiness.

3. Although their service is appreciated throughout the year, we set aside 14 
September as Ombudsman Appreciation Day. I encourage all commands to host 
appropriate functions that express our gratitude and appreciation. To learn 
more about the Ombudsman Program, visit the Fleet and Family Support Center 
website at WWW.FFSP.NAVY.MIL.

4. Ombudsmen, your devotion and perseverance is unparalleled.
On behalf of our entire Navy family, thank you!
