RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces guidance regarding administration of the 
Fall 2023 (cycle 113) Navy-wide Advancement Examination (NWAE) for Selected 
Reserve (SELRES) and Prior Service Reenlistment Eligibility Reserve (PRISE-R) 
Sailors.  Cycle 113 includes those SELRES candidates serving on voluntary 
recall, mobilization, or as canvasser recruiters. 
 
2.  SELRES E-4 candidates will continue to compete for advancement via the 
alternate final multiple score (A-FMS).  E-4 advancement candidates will not 
participate in the NWAE, but will be given the opportunity to compete for 
advancement via continued use of an A-FMS rank-order method, without the 
inclusion of an examination score from a proctored examination. 
 
3.  Cycle 113 will be the first cycle in which the E-4 NWAE will not be 
administered specifically for normal PRISE-R E-3 to E-4 advancement or to 
make a rate permanent for E-4 to E-4 PRISE-R Sailors.  Policy changes will be 
promulgated in a PRISE-R specific NAVADMIN.  Additionally, reference (a) will 
be updated to reflect the policy changes. 
 
4.  In line with references (b) and (c), the enlisted advancement worksheet 
(EAW) is the authoritative source of all data used to determine cycle 113 
eligibility.  Commands are to accurately validate, complete, and finalize all 
EAWs in the navy standard integrated personnel system (NSIPS).  EAW 
discrepancies may be addressed via the post-examination administration 
comment (PAC) process after worksheets are locked for the cycle. 
 
5.  Timeline: 
a.  30 June 2023.  Professional Military Knowledge – Eligibility Examination 
(PMK-EE) completion deadline.  In line with reference (d), PMK-EE remains 
mandatory once per paygrade for all Sailors to be eligible for NWAE cycle 
participation.  Refer to references (e) and (f) regarding special exceptions 
for new accessions. 
b.  1-31 August 2023.  Examination administration.

c.  E-6 candidate TIR requirements for early promote (EP) can be waived by 
one year with commanding officer (CO)/officer-in-charge (OIC) approval.  EAW

still bound by the same PMK-EE deadline as regular TIR candidates. 
d.  High-year tenure (HYT).  In line with reference (g), all SELRES are 
automatically approved to continue service through 30 September 2024 and all 
Fleet Reserve or retirement requests prior to this date are considered

reference (b).  All NWAE candidates must have applicable adjudication (Top 
Secret or Secret) or CO or OIC interim clearance dated prior to 1 August

discrepancy is corrected. 
f.  Performance mark average (PMA).  Compute PMA for all E-4 and E-5 
candidates and reporting senior's cumulative average (RSCA) PMA for E-6 
candidates in line with references (b) and (h).  Use all evaluations in
