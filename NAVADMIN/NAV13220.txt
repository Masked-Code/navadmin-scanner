RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the November 2013 Active Duty Officer 
Lateral Transfer/Redesignation Board.  One element of Navy's personnel 
program is to properly balance the skills and experience in the officer 
corps.  As part of the process, applications from qualified unrestricted 
line, restricted line, staff corps, and limited duty officers (LDO) are now 
being accepted for an Active Duty Officer Lateral Transfer/Redesignation 
Board which convenes 12 November 2013.  Full-Time Support (FTS) and Selected 
Reserve (SELRES) officers are not eligible to apply for this board.

2.  In addition to the year group (YG) limitations imposed in paragraph 6, 
applicants must also meet eligibility requirements detailed in refs
(a) through (c).
    a.  Members who do not meet eligibility requirements per refs (a) through 
(c) such as time-in-grade (TIG), years-of-commissioned service (YCS), or 
time-in-service (TIS) must submit a waiver package in addition to their 
lateral transfer/redesignation application.
    b.  Waiver packages must include member's waiver request and commanding 
officer's endorsement.  This endorsement is separate from any endorsements 
contained in the member's lateral transfer/redesignation application and must 
specifically address the eligibility requirement requiring a waiver.

3.  Submit applications and waiver packages, using the format in ref (b), to 
the address below:

7.  Notes:
    a.  Must have surface warfare officers (SWO) qualification completed to 
apply for transfer.  Officers under SWO continuation pay or revised junior 
critical skills retention bonus contract are not eligible for transfer until 
completion of requisite department head tours.  SWO serving under an 
agreement for any of the special or incentive pays are not eligible to apply 
to the board until within one year of satisfaction of the full obligation.
    b.  Waivers to the requirements of paragraph 4h of ref (b) for nuclear-
trained surface and submarine warfare officers may be considered on a case-
by-case basis.
    c.  Officers screened "not cleared" for their next career milestone are 
eligible.
    d.  The YG range provided displays possible opportunities.  Contact your 
specific community placement officer with questions regarding quota 
availability for each platform/community.  All officers YG-00 and senior are 
eligible, regardless of platform/community.
    e.  Judge advocates looking to laterally transfer to another community 
should be aware that upon lateral transfer to another community, they will 
lose the three years of constructive credit provided to judge advocates upon 
commissioning.  As a consequence, some junior officers with less than four 
years of total service, looking to laterally transfer, may be reduced in rank 
to LTJG.
    f.  LDO redesignation requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, 
considering impact to overall community health.  Nuclear LDO submissions will 
not be considered.  All other designators must have completed four years 
commissioned service and accepted permanent LDO appointment to LT prior to 
lateral transfer/redesignation.  LDO out quotas are extremely limited, 
special consideration will be given to those LCDRs with 28 or more years 
total active service facing statutory retirement as a LCDR.  Supply Corps and 
Information Dominance Corps applicants in YG's 07 and senior will receive 
favorable consideration.
    g.  Officers YG-11 and senior seeking lateral transfer into the surface 
warfare community are strongly encouraged to contact the SWO community 
manager prior to applying in order to discuss critical SWO career milestone 
requirements.
    h.  Only Restricted Line and Staff Corps selections to the Naval Special 
Warfare (NSW) community will be processed via this board.  
Unrestricted Line applications for NSW will not be considered by this board.  
All applicants must be eligible for Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented 
Information (TS/SCI) security clearance, worldwide assignable, meet 
requirements of ref (d) and pass physical screening 
test per ref (e).   
    i.  Warfare qualified officers in YG-11 seeking lateral transfer into the 
Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), community are strongly encouraged to

Warfare (IW) or Intelligence communities:  O4 and O5 applicants for 1820 with 
more than two years time-in-grade should contact the IP community manager to 
discuss milestone and performance requirements.  All officers who are either 
above or in-zone for FY-15 promotion to LCDR through CAPT will not be 
considered for lateral transfer.  IP, IW, and Intel applicants must be 
eligible for TS/SCI, have a single scope background investigation (SSBI) 
completed within the past five years, or upon selection submit a personnel 
security questionnaire (SF-86) per ref (h).  
IW applicants that do not hold or are not currently eligible for TS/SCI must 
complete an SCI eligibility pre-screening interview with the fleet cyber 
command security directorate field office at (850) 452-6868 and submit the

Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT), oral proficiency interview (OPI), 
or Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB)
- DLPT/OPI level 2 or higher, DLAB score greater than 120 and Arabic, 
Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Turkish, and French speakers are highly 
desirable.  Applicants without a regionally-focused masters degree must have
