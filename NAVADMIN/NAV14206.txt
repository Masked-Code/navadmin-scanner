NARR/Reference (a) is NAVADMIN 080/14; Navy systems continuing to operate 
with Windows XP or older operating systems.//

RMKS/1.  Reference (a) provided notification indicating Microsoft*s Windows 
XP operating system (WIN XP) has reached end of life and the vendor will no 
longer employ support system upgrades or mitigation of vulnerabilities.  To 
ensure end-to-end cyber security posture and enterprise configuration 
management, Navy will accelerate the process to eradicate the remaining WIN 
XP instances and support a migration effort to Microsoft*s Windows 7 
operating systems (WIN 7).

2.  Navy has entered into a Microsoft Custom Support Agreement (MCSA) to 
provide minimal vulnerability support for the remaining WIN XP currently in 
use across the enterprise.  The MCSA is in effect from
8 April 2014 to 14 April 2015.  MCSA will deliver operational continuity by 
providing security *hotfixes* for WIN XP.  Space and Naval Warfare Systems 
Command (SPAWAR) has established a central repository for downloading 
hotfixes via the SAILOR web portal.  For access to SAILOR contact Elle 
Bergeron, SPAWAR 4.3.3, (619) 221 -7819, or e-mail: 
elle.bergeron(at)navy.mil.  Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command will 
control notification of security hotfixes and compliance reporting via the 
existing information assurance vulnerability alert process.

3.  Navy is developing a comprehensive migration/eradication plan for both 
ashore and afloat systems.
    a.  Ashore compliance will align with the plan of action and
    milestones (POA&Ms) previously submitted to OPNAV N2N6 by the
    responsible program manager (PM) and Echelon II Command
    Information
   Office (ECH II CIO).  All ashore assets must be WIN 7 compliant
    and
    or compatible by 30 April 2015 or risk disconnect from all Navy
    networks.
    b. Given the complexities associated with the afloat environment,
    WIN XP support will likely be required beyond 14 April
    2015.  Combined Fleet, SYSCOM, PM and Microsoft Eradication Team
    efforts are currently underway for data collection, onsite
    surveys,
    and analysis of the afloat environment, including all non
    -consolidated afloat networks and enterprise services
    platforms.  This analysis will enable development of an
    enterprise
    POA&M to assist in the migration of afloat IT assets to a WIN 7
    or
    greater operating system as quickly as possible.

4.  This evolution requires a commitment from all PMs and ECH II CIOs acting 
as focal points for addressing migration/eradication requirements.  
Cooperation and full disclosure with the contracted Microsoft eradication 
team is essential for this effort to be a success.

5.  Point of contact is Ms. Andrea St. John, OPNAV N2N6BC2 at (571) 256-8512 
or email:  andrea.stjohn(at)navy.mil.
