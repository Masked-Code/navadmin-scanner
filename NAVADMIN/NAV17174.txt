RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces a revision to the Navy Enlisted 
Classification (NEC) code construct and the realignment of rating communities 
and career fields.  These efforts are foundational to the continued 
development and implementation of the Ready Relevant Learning (RRL) pillar of 
Sailor 2025 and are also fundamental to the rating modernization initiative.  
The revised NEC construct is more logical and will allow for more efficient 
coding as Sailors transition through the training continuum during their 
careers.

2.  As outlined in reference (a), RRL is a transformational Navy training 
initiative that will accelerate the learning of every Sailor for faster 
response to our rapidly changing warfighting requirements, and achieve higher 
performance by coupling the timing and method of training delivery with the 
actual deck plate needs of Sailors.  Block Learning (BL) revises current 
initial training paths into separate blocks, which are distributed over time.  
Under BL, each block of training will yield a unique NEC code.  This will 
enable the identification of the progress of a Sailor through a training 
pathway comprised of the blocks, which will aid in career management.

3.  The revised NEC construct is designed to allow for a more logical 
grouping of NEC codes that will be organized into 12 communities and 23 
career fields.  The summary of these revised communities and career field may 
be viewed at http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/reference/nec/Pages/default.aspx.  These revised communities and career 
fields were developed within the rating modernization working group (WG) with 
the active participation of all community stakeholders.  They will replace 
the occupational fields and associated ratings listed in reference (b).  
These communities and career fields will not only aid the rating 
modernization effort, but they also more directly translate to civilian 
occupations, where applicable, which will help with credentialing efforts.
    a.  Beginning with the October 2017 publication of reference
(b), the first letter of associated NEC code will specify the career fields.
    b.  The second and third digits will be unique alpha-numeric identifiers 
developed by the Navy Manpower Analysis Center.
    c.  The fourth digit will represent the number of blocks of training 
remaining in a BL sequence or will indicate the NEC code is not part of 
blocked training.  For example, the current NEC code for Logistics Specialist 
Postal Basic (NEC 2800) would become S000 under the new construct.

      - 1st Digit:  S (supply career field)
      - 2nd Digit:  0 (part of unique identifier assigned by NAVMAC)
      - 3rd Digit:  0 (part of unique identifier assigned by NAVMAC)
      - 4th Digit:  0 (all blocks complete)
                    1 (1 block remaining)
                    2 (2 blocks remaining)
                    3 (3 blocks remaining)
                    4 (4 blocks remaining)
                    letters A-Z (NEC code is not associated with blocked 
training).

4.  The revised NEC construct along with the communities and career fields 
will become part of references (b) and (c) in an upcoming Navy Enlisted 
Occupational Classification System (NEOCS) Manual update.  Effective 
immediately, any newly established NEC code will be created using the new NEC 
construct.  In October 2017, the revised NEC construct will be established 
for those NEC codes in ratings that have transitioned to BL.  Quarterly 
updates to reference (c) will identify the NEC codes that have completed the 
conversion to the revised construct in a crosswalk table between old and 
revised NEC codes.  References (b) and (c) can be viewed at
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/nec/Pages/default.aspx.

5.  Another aspect of the revised NEC construct currently being developed is 
a two-digit suffix to the NEC code which will contain additional information 
about the skill sets of a Sailor.  This is intended to better capture the 
proficiency, experience, and skills currency of a Sailor, which are 
fundamental elements of the rating modernization efforts for the Navy.  
Community stakeholders will be key participants in developing this concept 
via the enlisted career fields sub-WG of the rating modernization effort.
