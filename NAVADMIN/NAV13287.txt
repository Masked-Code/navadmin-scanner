SUBJ/UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS BIRTHDAY 2013//

RMKS/1.  On the 10th of November we will mark the 238th anniversary of the 
birth of the United States Marine Corps. From its humble beginnings at the 
start of the American War for Independence, the Marine Corps has grown to 
become the most fearsome expeditionary fighting force the world has ever 
known.

2.  The Marine Corps legacy was forged in blood and fire in battles large and 
small, from the trenches of the First World War, to the Pacific Islands 
campaign of World War II, to innumerable smaller conflicts around the globe.  
That hard-won tradition continues today as Marines serve with courage and 
honor in Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, Africa, and myriad other locations.  
The sun never sets on the Corps.

3.  From the beginning, the Navy has been a proud partner of the Marine Corps 
in every conflict and endeavor, in war and in peace. As we look to the 
future, though our war fighting tactics and concepts will evolve, the strong 
relationship between our two services will remain constant.  We will stand 
together as the world's dominant sea power to safeguard the Nation and its 
vital interests. 

4.  Semper Fi, Shipmates, and Happy Birthday!

5.  Released by the Chief of Naval Operations.//
