RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides amended guidance to reference (a) for the 
timing of the 2021 E-6 periodic evaluation cycle to account for delays in the 
release of reference (b).  Selectees for advancement can expect to be 
assigned their original date of rank, which will overlap with the end of the 
traditional reporting period for E-6 periodic evaluations.  This will relieve 
administrative burdens on commands by eliminating the need to reprocess 
evaluations, accurately ensuring reporting continuity for Sailors who 
advanced and ensuring standardized reporting across the Navy. 
    a.  Reporting seniors shall conduct normal E-6 periodic evaluations after 
the release of the Active Duty E-7 advancement results and submit E-6 
periodic evaluations to Navy Personnel Command no later than 15 December 
2021.  The end of the reporting period will remain 15 November 2021 for 
normal periodic evaluations. 
    b.  Sailors selected for advancement to E-7 will receive an E-6 
promotion/frocking evaluation ending on 14 November 2021. 
 
2.  For questions and concerns regarding these policy changes, contact Force 
Master Chief Detje at (901)874-3030, or via e-mail at
