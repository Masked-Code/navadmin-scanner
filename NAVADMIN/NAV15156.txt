RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the solicitation of applications from highly 
qualified and motivated E-6 through E-9 personnel for the FY-17 Limited Duty 
Officer (LDO) and Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) Program.  LDOs and CWOs bring a 
variety of experience and unique perspectives into the wardroom from their 
enlisted service.  The LDO/CWO career paths provide additional leadership 
opportunities and enhance a Sailor's ability to contribute to the Navy.  
These programs deliver to the officer corps seasoned professionals with 
proven leadership abilities at an economical cost.  LDOs provide broad 
technical management and leadership skills, and CWOs provide specific 
technical expertise and leadership skills in support of the unrestricted 
line, restricted line, and staff corps communities.
LDOs and CWOs serve in a variety of leadership billets within their technical 
fields, ranging from division officer to commanding officer (CO) ashore.

2.  Updated policy guidance to reference (a).
    a.  Non-nuclear applicants:  Time in service (TIS) eligibility 
requirements for FY-17 and beyond are 8-14 years of service for LDO and 14-20

waivers up to 22 years of service will be considered for master chief petty 
officers only.
    b.  Nuclear applicants:  Refer to paragraph 11 of this message for
