MANAGEMENT BUSINESS RULES//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN UPDATES THE BUSINESS RULES ON INDIVIDUAL 
AUGMENTATION MANPOWER MANAGEMENT (IAMM) ASSIGNMENTS IN SUPPORT OF 
OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS (OCO) AND SUPERCEDES REF A.

2.  IAMM BUSINESS RULES AND DEFINITIONS.
    A.  CAPACITY/REDLINES.
       (1) SEA-DUTY CAPACITY.  SEA-DUTY CAPACITY IS THE NUMBER
       OF SEA-DUTY PERSONNEL
ABOVE A RISK-BASED
 REDLINE APPLIED BY UNIT IDENTIFICATION CODE (UIC).  IN GENERAL,  
REDLINES ARE CURRENTLY SET AT 90 PERCENT OF P9 BILLETS AUTHORIZED (BA).  
ADDITIONALLY, REDLINES ARE SET AT 95 PERCENT OF P9 BA FOR OPTIMALLY 
MANNED SHIPS (LHA, LHD, CG, DDG).  FOR ENLISTED PERSONNEL, REDLINES ARE 
CONSIDERED IN THE COMPUTATION OF AVAILABLE ASSETS IN THE CAPACITY MODEL.
UNITED STATES FLEET FORCES GLOBAL FORCE MANAGER (USFF GFM), IN 
COORDINATION WITH OPNAV N1 AND OPNAV N3/N5, MAY MODIFY REDLINES BY 
COMMUNITY AND/OR UIC (AS REQUIRED OR APPROPRIATE TO CHANGE CAPACITY).  
REDLINES ARE A MANAGEMENT GUIDE AND DO NOT MEAN A SPECIFIC COMMAND/UNIT 
IDENTIFICATION CODE (UIC) WILL NOT BE TASKED TO PROVIDE AN INDIVIDUAL 
AUGMENTATION (IA) IF FILLING THE REQUIREMENT WILL BRING THEM BELOW THE 
REDLINE BY UIC, SKILL SET, OR PAY BAND.  THE MAJORITY OF LOW SUPPLY 
/HIGH DEMAND
(LS/HD) RATINGS AND DESIGNATORS ARE ALREADY BELOW CAPACITY AND 
ESTABLISHED REDLINES.
BUDGET SUBMITTING OFFICES (BSOS) AND TYPE COMMANDERS (TYCOMS) ARE IN THE 
BEST POSITION TO DECIDE WHO TO SUB-TASK AND WILL CAREFULLY MANAGE IA 
REQUIREMENTS TO MINIMIZE READINESS IMPACT TO COMMANDS/UNITS.  CURRENTLY 
EXCLUDED FROM CAPACITY
ARE:  TYPE 3 AND 4 SEA DUTY;
NUCLEAR TRAINED PERSONNEL ASSIGNED TO CVN, SSN, SSBN, SSGN AND NUCLEAR 
PIPELINE TRAINING COMMANDS; AND SPECIAL WARFARE (SPECWAR) ASSIGNED TO 
USSOCOM.
PERSONNEL EXCLUDED FROM
CAPACITY MAY BE ASSIGNED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.
       (2) SHORE-DUTY CAPACITY.  SHORE-DUTY CAPACITY IS THE
       NUMBER OF SHORE-DUTY
PERSONNEL ABOVE A RISK-BASED REDLINE APPLIED BY UIC.  IN GENERAL, 
REDLINES ARE SET AT
75 PERCENT OF P9 BA FOR UNITS MANNED BY MISSION, FUNCTION AND TASK 
DOCUMENTS AND 90 PERCENT OF P9 BA FOR UNITS MANNED BY FLEET MANNING 
DOCUMENTS.  USFF GFM, IN COORDINATION WITH OPNAV N1 AND OPNAV N3/N5, MAY 
MODIFY REDLINES BY COMMUNITY AND /OR UIC (AS REQUIRED OR APPROPRIATE TO 
CHANGE CAPACITY).  REDLINES ARE ONLY A MANAGEMENT GUIDE AND DO NOT MEAN 
A SPECIFIC COMMAND/UIC WILL NOT BE TASKED TO PROVIDE AN IA IF FILLING 
THE REQUIREMENT WILL BRING THEM BELOW THE REDLINE BY UIC, SKILL SET OR 
PAY BAND.  THE MAJORITY OF LS/HD RATINGS AND DESIGNATORS ARE ALREADY 
BELOW CAPACITY AND ESTABLISHED REDLINES.  BSOS/TYCOMS ARE IN THE BEST 
POSITION TO DECIDE WHO TO SUBTASK AND WILL CAREFULLY MANAGE THEIR IA 
REQUIREMENTS TO MINIMIZE READINESS IMPACT TO THEIR COMMANDS /UNITS.  
CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM CAPACITY ARE:  TYPE 6 OVERSEAS DUTY, JOINT DUTY, 
NON -DISTRIBUTABLE MANNING (STUDENTS, TRANSIENTS,TPPH), NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
(SECURITY, MAINTENANCE) BILLETS, NUCLEAR PROPULSION CODED BILLETS 
(AVAILABLE FOR ASSIGNMENT WITH OPNAV N133 APPROVAL), AND A PORTION OF 
MANPOWER, PERSONNEL, TRAINING AND EDUCATION (MPTE) READINESS BILLETS 
(E.G., CRITICAL INSTRUCTOR, RECRUIT DIVISION COMMANDER BILLETS, 
PRODUCTION RECRUITERS AND PRODUCTION SUPPORT (9612/9586)).  PERSONNEL 
EXCLUDED FROM CAPACITY MAY BE ASSIGNED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.
    B.  AC TASKING ALLOCATION.  THE GOAL IS TO BALANCE
    DISTRIBUTION OF REQUIREMENTS
BETWEEN BSOS/TYCOMS BASED ON SKILL SET, PAY BAND, AND TOUR LENGTH.
       (1) DISTRIBUTION OF REQUIREMENTS WILL BE PROPORTIONAL
       TO THE BSO/TYCOM COMPONENT
OF THE NET CAPACITY (NET BALANCE).  USFF (N1) WILL MANAGE REQUIREMENTS 
THROUGH THE BSOS/TYCOMS.  BSOS/TYCOMS WILL MANAGE THEIR SUB-CLAIMANTS IN 
THE SAME MANNER.
       (2) LS/HD COMMUNITY  MANPOWER ANALYSIS.  USFF N1 WILL
       MANAGE AND TASK LS/HD
COMMUNITIES.
       (3) EXISTING REQUIREMENTS (REFILLS).  UPON RECEIVING
       TASKING TO REFILL AN
EXISTING IA REQUIREMENT, BSOS/TYCOMS SHALL HAVE NO MORE THAN 30 DAYS TO 
PROVIDE THE NOMINEE TO USFF N1.
       (4) NEW REQUIREMENTS:  UPON RECEIVING TASKING FOR A NEW
       IA REQUIREMENT, BSOS/TYCOMS
SHALL HAVE NO MORE THAN 30 DAYS TO PROVIDE THE NOMINEE TO USFF N1.
       (5) EMERGENT REQUIREMENTS.  EMERGENT REQUIREMENTS ARE
       THOSE WHERE DELIVERY OF ORDERS
TO THE SELECTED IA MAY BE LESS THAN 60 DAYS PRIOR TO THE FIRST INTERIM 
STOP REPORT DATE.
BSOS/TYCOMS SHALL HAVE UP TO 15 DAYS TO PROVIDE A NOMINATION TO USFF N1.
       (6) BSO/TYCOM SUB-TASKING PROCESS SHOULD ALLOW FOR
       MAXIMUM TIME TO IDENTIFY RIGHT FIT FOR FILL WHILE MEETING TASKING 
TIMELINES AND NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.
       (7) NOMINEE SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE ON THE DATE NOTED IN
       THE TASKING MESSAGE.  USFF MEASURES BSO/TYCOM RESPONSIVENESS TO 
DUE DATES IN ITS MONTHLY METRICS.
       (8) ALL BY-NAME-REQUESTS (BNR), VOLUNTEERS, OR OTHER
       SELECTIONS SHALL BE REFERRED TO THE BSO/TYCOM FOR CONCURRENCE.  
IF A BNR IS NOT AGREED UPON, THE BSO /TYCOM IS STILL REQUIRED TO SUPPORT 
THE REQUIREMENT AND SHALL NOMINATE A REPLACEMENT.  IF THE BSO /TYCOM 
DOES NOT HAVE ANY OTHER QUALIFIED CANDIDATES, ADVISE USFF VIA THE 
RECLAMA PROCESS, AND THE REQUIREMENT WILL BE RETASKED, AS APPROPRIATE.
       (9) THE SKILL SET STATED IN THE TASKING MESSAGE
       REPRESENTS THE DEMAND SIGNAL OF THE COMBATANT COMMANDER AND 
SHOULD BE FILLED AS TASKED.  USFF N1 WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO PROVIDE 
ALL AVAILABLE REQUIREMENT INFORMATION IN THE TASKING MESSAGE.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, THE TASKING MESSAGE WILL PROVIDE ALTERNATE RATINGS/DESIGNATORS 
THAT MAY FILL A REQUIREMENT WHEN SUITABLE SUBSTITUTION INFORMATION IS 
AVAILABLE.  USFF RECOGNIZES THAT REQUESTS TO WAIVE THE STATED 
REQUIREMENT MAY BE NECESSARY IN SOME CASES.  TO ENSURE MISSION AND 
SAILOR SUCCESS, WAIVERS NORMALLY REQUIRE APPROVAL FROM IN-THEATER 
COMMANDERS AND TAKE TIME TO PROCESS.  BSOS/TYCOMS ARE DIRECTED TO 
MINIMIZE THESE WAIVERS TO NO MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR TOTAL 
TASKINGS FOR THE MONTH.
       (10) SWAPS.  USFF ROUTINELY RECEIVES REQUESTS TO SWAP
       NOMINATIONS.  SWAPS CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REWORK AND REDUCE SAILOR 
NOTIFICATION TIME.  REQUESTS TO CHANGE PRIMARY, AUXILIARY, AND/OR 
ALTERNATE NOMINATIONS ARE CLOSELY EVALUATED AND WILL BE GIVEN 
CONSIDERATION IN EMERGENCY OR SEVERE HARDSHIP CASES.  SWAPS FOR 
CONVENIENCE OF A COMMAND OR SAILOR WILL GENERALLY NOT BE APPROVED.
       (11) RECLAMA TO IA TASKING.  IF BSOS/TYCOMS CONSIDER A
       RECLAMA APPROPRIATE, SUBMIT RECLAMA TO USFF N1 WITHIN 10 BUSINESS 
DAYS OF RECEIPT OF TASKING MESSAGE.  RECLAMA SHALL INCLUDE DETAILED 
JUSTIFICATION REGARDING INABILITY TO SUPPORT.  INCLUDE STATEMENT 
REGARDING MISSION/OPERATIONAL READINESS IMPACT AND IDENTIFY ANY 
POTENTIAL DEGRADATION OF SERVICES IF REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE IA 
REQUIREMENT.  AS PART OF THE RECLAMA PROCESS, USFF N1 MAY REQUEST BSO 
/TYCOM PROVIDE A NAME-BY-NAME LIST OF ALL QUALIFIED CANDIDATES 
EXPLAINING THE REASON WHY EACH MEMBER CANNOT SUPPORT THE IA.
    C.  NOTIFICATION TIME.  THE STANDARD IS 90 DAYS OR MORE WITH
    A MINIMUM OF 60 DAYS NOTIFICATION.
HOWEVER, OPERATIONAL NEED MAY RESULT IN SOME SAILORS RECEIVING LESS THAN 
60 DAYS NOTIFICATION.
       (1) BSOS/TYCOMS SHALL CERTIFY IN THEIR SUBMISSION TO
       USFF N1 THAT PRIMARY, AUXILLIARY AND EMBEDDED ALTERNATE NOMINEES 
HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THEIR SELECTION AND SHALL ENSURE NOMINEES BEGIN 
PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLISTS AND PROCESSING.
       (2) BSOS/TYCOMS THAT SOLICIT VOLUNTEERS AND/OR IA
       CANDIDATES FROM MULTIPLE ISICS/COMMANDS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
ENSURING CANDIDATES NOT CHOSEN RECEIVE TIMELY AND OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION 
FROM THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.
       (3) DATE OF NOTIFICATION IS OFFICIALLY MEASURED FROM
       THE DATE OF ORDERS ISSUANCE:  90-DAY NOTIFICATION IS THE 
BENCHMARK; 60-DAY NOTIFICATION IS THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT.
       (4) IF IN DANGER OF BROACHING THE 60-DAY NOTIFICATION
       LIMIT, AT THE 70-DAY POINT, BSOS/TYCOMS WILL ASSIGN A NOMINEE TO 
THE BILLET AND WILL GIVE THE CHAIN OF COMMAND TWO BUSINESS DAYS TO 
ACCEPT OR PROPOSE A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE.
       (5) 60-DAY NOTIFICATION WAIVERS WILL ONLY BE CONSIDERED
       IF THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT
READINESS IMPACT ON THE MISSION, NOT SOLELY ON THE BASIS THAT A SAILOR 
IS WILLING TO REPORT LESS THAN 60 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THE ORDERS.  THE 
CHIEF OF NAVY PERSONNEL WILL BE INFORMED OF ANY NOTIFICATION LESS THAN 
30 DAYS.
    D.  IA CANDIDATE BUSINESS RULES.
       (1) LEGACY IA ELIGIBLE SAILORS ARE THOSE SAILORS
       OUTSIDE THE GSA/OSA ASSIGNMENT RULES WHO HAVE GREATER THAN NINE 
MONTHS REMAINING ON THEIR SEA OR SHORE TOUR AND HAVE BEEN IN HOMEPORT 
FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS.  VOLUNTEERS SHALL BE GIVEN FIRST PRIORITY FOR 
IA ASSIGNMENT.
       (2) SECOND TOUR IA.  BSOS/TYCOMS SHALL NOT SUBMIT A
       NOMINEE WHO HAS COMPLETED A PREVIOUS IA
TOUR WITHIN THE PAST THREE YEARS.   SUBMIT WAIVERS TO THIS POLICY TO
USFF N1.  USFF WILL CONSIDER
WAIVERS ONLY IF THE MEMBER IS A VOLUNTEER AND NO OTHER CANDIDATES ARE 
AVAILABLE AND DEPLOYABLE WITHIN THE BSO/TYCOM AOR.  RATINGS/DESIGNATORS 
THAT DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT INVENTORY TO SUPPORT A THREE-YEAR EXCLUSION 
WILL BE HANDLED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.
       (3) PERSTEMPO/ITEMPO/DWELL TIME.  IAS WILL BE AFFORDED
       THE APPROPRIATE REPRIEVE BETWEEN
DEPLOYMENTS.  EACH NOMINEE SHALL BE REVIEWED TO ENSURE THE MEMBER DID 
NOT RECENTLY RETURN FROM A DEPLOYMENT OR WILL NOT FACE A DEPLOYMENT 
AFTER THE IA.  OPNAVINST 3000.13C CONTAINS POLICY REGARDING DWELL TIME 
AND SHALL BE APPLIED TO IAMM DEPLOYMENTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, A SAILOR WHO 
COMPLETED A SIX-MONTH DEPLOYMENT SHOULD NOT FILL AN IA REQUIREMENT UNTIL 
SIX MONTHS AFTER THE DEPLOYMENT.  COMMANDS ARE REQUIRED TO DOCUMENT IA 
DEPLOYMENTS AS ITEMPO EVENTS.  WHEN THERE IS NO OTHER VIABLE ALTERNATIVE 
THAN TO SELECT A MEMBER WHOSE OCO DEPLOYMENT WOULD VIOLATE DWELL OR 
ITEMPO REQUIREMENTS, REFER THE CASE TO USFF N1 FOR WAIVER CONSIDERATION.
       (4) PRD MANAGEMENT.  PERSONNEL IN THEIR NORMAL PCS
       DETAILING NEGOTIATION WINDOW (I.E., WITHIN NINE MONTHS OF PRD) OR 
WHO ARE CURRENTLY UNDER ORDERS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO FILL IA REQUIREMENTS 
VIA THE IAMM PROCESS.  IF REQUIRED, PRDS FOR PERSONNEL SELECTED FOR AN 
IA TOUR WILL BE ADJUSTED TO A MINIMUM OF TWO MONTHS FOLLOWING THE 
ESTIMATED DATE OF RETURN.
           (A) FOR ENLISTED PERSONNEL, USFF SHALL INITIATE
           A PRD CHANGE REQUEST TO PERS-40 TO SUPPORT THE IA.
           (B) FOR OFFICER PERSONNEL, PARENT COMMANDS
           SHALL INITIATE A PRD CHANGE WITH THE OFFICER'S DETAILER 
CITING THE REASON:  PRD CHANGE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT NAVY OCO EFFORTS AS 
DIRECTED BY HIGHER AUTHORITY.
           (C) IAS COMING FROM SEA DUTY WILL MAINTAIN
           THEIR EXISTING SEA DUTY PROJECTED ROTATION DATES (PRDS).
           (D) ENLISTED IAS COMING FROM SHORE
           DUTY.  FREEZE THE SHORE DUTY CLOCK WITH THE FOLLOWING
GUIDELINES:
               1. 100 PERCENT DAY-FOR-DAY CREDIT FOR
               AN IA TOUR SERVED IN HAZARDOUS DUTY ZONES.
               2. 50 PERCENT DAY-FOR-DAY CREDIT FOR AN
               IA TOUR SERVED OUTSIDE HAZARDOUS DUTY ZONES.
               3. REDUCTION OF PRESCRIBED SEA TOUR
               (PST) FOR THOSE SAILORS REQUIRED TO RETURN TO SEA (FOR 
NEEDS OF THE SERVICE) PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF THEIR ADJUSTED SHORE DUTY 
TIME.
       (5) EAOS MANAGEMENT.  WE EXPECT SAILORS TO GO FORWARD
       IN SUPPORT OF OCO OPERATIONS.  PERSONNEL SELECTED FOR AN IA MUST 
HAVE AN EAOS A MINIMUM OF THREE (3) MONTHS FOLLOWING THE ESTIMATED DATE 
OF RETURN FROM THE IA.  IF REQUIRED, PERSONNEL SHOULD EXTEND OR REENLIST 
AS APPROPRIATE TO ENSURE THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT OBLIGATED SERVICE.  
DETAILERS/BUPERS-32 WILL CONSIDER HIGH-YEAR TENURE WAIVERS ON A CASE-BY-
CASE BASIS.
       (6) HIGH YEAR TENURE (HYT).
           (A) SAILORS DETERMINED TO BE HYT MAY VOLUNTEER
           FOR OSA ORDERS PROVIDED THAT THE ESTIMATED RETURN FROM 
DEPLOYMENT ALLOWS FOR A MINIMUM OF FOUR (4) MONTHS TRANSITION BETWEEN 
RETURN AND THE MANDATORY SEPARATION DATE.
           (B) SAILORS ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF OSA
           ORDERS, WHO ARE SUBSEQUENTLY DEEMED TO BE HYT, WILL BE 
EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS BY USFF AND PERS.
           (C)  REQUESTS TO WAIVE MINIMUM TRANSITION TIME
           WILL BE EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.
       (7) RETIREMENT.
           (A) SAILORS WHO HAVE SUBMITTED AND BEEN
           APPROVED FOR RETIREMENT MAY NOT VOLUNTEER FOR OSA ORDERS 
UNLESS THE ESTIMATED RETURN FROM DEPLOYMENT ALLOWS FOR A MINIMUM OF FIVE 
MONTHS TRANSITION BETWEEN RETURN AND RETIREMENT DATE.
           (B) REQUESTS TO WAIVE MINIMUM TRANSITION TIME
           WILL BE EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.
       (8) RANK.  SAILORS MUST BE ONE UP/ONE DOWN FROM STATED

           CASE-BY CASE-BASIS.
       (9) SECURITY CLEARANCE.  AT THE TIME OF NOMINATION
       SUBMISSION, SAILOR MUST POSSESS REQUIRED SECURITY CLEARANCE OR 
HAVE INTERIM GRANTED.
       (10) RATE/DESIGNATOR.  PERSONNEL IN LS/HD SKILL SET MAY
       NOT BE USED TO FILL A REQUIREMENT OUTSIDE THEIR SKILL SET AND ARE 
EXCLUDED FROM "ANY RATE" OR "1050 OFFICER" OR "1000 OFFICER" IA 
ASSIGNMENTS.
       (11) RETIREMENT/RESIGNATION:  IF A MEMBER SUBMITS A
       RETIREMENT REQUEST OR RESIGNATION FOLLOWING VERBAL NOTIFICATION 
OF AN IAMM ASSIGNMENT, BUT PRIOR TO ORDERS ISSUANCE, THE CHAIN OF 
COMMAND SHALL INDICATE THIS ACTION ON THE REQUEST.  RETIREMENT REQUESTS 
THAT WOULD PRECLUDE COMPLETION OF THE ASSIGNMENT WILL NOT NORMALLY BE 
ACCEPTED.
       (12) PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.  DETAILERS, COMMUNITY
       MANAGERS AND PARENT COMMANDS, IN COORDINATION WITH BSOS/TYCOMS, 
ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO MANAGE A SAILOR'S INDIVIDUAL PROFESSIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT AND CAREER MILESTONES AND SHALL COLLABORATE TO MINIMIZE 
NEGATIVE IMPACT TO AN INDIVIDUAL SAILOR.
       (13) VOLUNTEERS.  ALL VOLUNTEERS FROM COMMANDS NOT
       INCLUDED IN CAPACITY REQUIRE COMMAND ENDORSEMENT.
NUCLEAR CODED SHORE BILLET ASSIGNED VOLUNTEERS REQUIRE OPNAV N133 
CONCURRENCE PRIOR TO ASSIGNMENT.
    E.  ORDERS.
       (1) IAMM ORDERS.  SAILORS CAN VIEW TEMADD/ITDY ORDERS

LOADING AND NAVY INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTEE COMBAT TRAINING
(NIACT) QUOTA CONTROL.  LEVEL LOADING IS PROJECTED WELL IN ADVANCE AND 
IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE CAPACITY IS NOT EXCEEDED.  THE NMPS SITE LISTED 
ON THE MEMBER'S ORDERS IS THE APPROVED LOCATION.  REQUESTS FOR 
PROCESSING THROUGH ALTERNATE NMPS SITES WILL NORMALLY BE DENIED.
       (3) CHANGES TO ORDERS.  ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL RECEIVES
       ORDERS, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THOSE ORDERS (GREATER THAN 30-DAY 
IMPACT ON DEPARTURE FROM AND RETURN TO PARENT
UNIT) SHALL BE HANDLED AS FOLLOWS:
           (A) IF A BILLET IS CANCELLED LESS THAN 60 DAYS
           FROM FIRST INTERIM STOP (NMPS REPORT DATE), THE MEMBER WILL 
HAVE THE OPTION TO BE ASSIGNED TO ANOTHER BILLET, PROVIDED ONE IS 
AVAILABLE WITHIN RANK AND SKILL-SET MATCH.  THE MEMBER'S BSO/TYCOM SHALL 
IDENTIFY A NEW BILLET ASSIGNMENT, EITHER WORKING FROM THE BILLETS TASKED 
TO THE BSO/TYCOM OR BY COORDINATING WITH USFF N1 TO CHOOSE FROM ALL OPEN 
BILLETS.
           (B) IF A BILLET IS CANCELLED GREATER THAN 60
           DAYS FROM FIRST INTERIM STOP (NMPS REPORT DATE), THE MEMBER

EVALUATE OPTIONS FOR REASSIGNMENT TO ANOTHER LIKE REQUIREMENT.  THE 
BSO/TYCOM SHALL BE NOTIFIED OF USFF'S DECISION TO EITHER REASSIGN MEMBER 
TO ANOTHER LINE NUMBER OR RETURN MEMBER TO PARENT COMMAND.  USFF
(N1) SHALL GAIN BSO/TYCOM CONCURRENCE IF THE REASSIGNED LINE NUMBER WILL 
RESULT IN A LATER RETURN DATE OF THE SAILOR.
    F.  IA BUSINESS RULES ON AUXILIARIES AND EMBEDDED ALTERNATES.
HISTORICAL DATA REVEALS THAT FALLOUT RATES CONTINUE TO REMAIN 
APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT, DESPITE INCREASED AWARENESS OF IA SCREENING 
REQUIREMENTS.  AUXILIARY AND EMBEDDED ALTERNATE DEFINITIONS AND BUSINESS 
RULES:
       (1) AUXILIARY NOMINEES ARE NOT REQUIRED FOR O5/O6
       REQUIREMENTS.
       (2) AUXILIARY.  AN AUXILIARY TO THE PRIMARY CANDIDATE
       WHO IS A BACK-UP TO DEPLOY IN PLACE OF THE PRIMARY IF REQUIRED.  
AUXILIARIES ARE NOT ASSIGNED TO A SEPARATE LINE NUMBER FROM THE PRIMARY 
AND DO NOT RECEIVE TRAINING IN PARALLEL WITH THE PRIMARY.
           (A) SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR AUXILIARY
           NOMINEES.  AUXILIARIES WILL BE USED FOR IA REQUIREMENTS
           THAT
REQUIRE THE STANDARD TRAINING PACKAGE OF NMPS AND NIACT.  BSOS/TYCOMS 
SHALL IDENTIFY TWO NOMINEES FOR EACH REQUIREMENT LINE NUMBER.  
BSOS/TYCOMS MUST USE THEIR OWN MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES TO IDENTIFY AND 
MANAGE THEIR AUXILIARIES.  USFF SHALL REQUIRE THAT A REPLACEMENT NOMINEE 
BE SUBMITTED WITHIN TWO WORKING DAYS OF NOTIFICATION THAT THE PRIMARY 
HAS DROPPED.  AUXILIARY NOMINEES SHALL NOT BE UTILIZED FOR OTHER LINE 
NUMBERS UNTIL THE PRIMARY HAS DEPLOYED TO THEATER.
           (B) AUXILIARY PREPARATION.  AUXILIARIES SHOULD
           BE BRIEFED OF THE PROBABILITY THEY MAY BE ELEVATED TO PRIMARY 
STATUS SHOULD THE PRIMARY FALL OUT.  HOWEVER, AUXILIARIES SHALL NOT MAKE 
ANY IRREVERSIBLE DECISIONS SUCH AS RELOCATING A FAMILY MEMBER OR 
TERMINATING A LEASE UNTIL OFFICIAL IA ORDERS ARE RECEIVED.
           (C) AUXILIARY ACTIVATION.  IF THE PRIMARY
           NOMINEE IS NO LONGER QUALIFIED TO FULFILL THE IA, USFF
           WILL
NOTIFY THE BSO/TYCOM THE AUXILIARY WILL BE ELEVATED TO PRIMARY.  ORDERS 
WILL BE ISSUED TO THE AUXILIARY TO PROVIDE AT LEAST 30 DAYS 
NOTIFICATION.  IF ORDERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROCESSED FOR THE ORIGINAL 
PRIMARY, USFF WILL REQUEST CANCELLATION ORDERS FOR THE ORIGINAL NOMINEE.
       (3) EMBEDDED ALTERNATES.  EMBEDDED ALTERNATES ARE
       ASSIGNED TO A SPECIFIC LINE NUMBER AND WILL ATTEND TRAINING IN 
PARALLEL WITH THE OTHER PERSONNEL ASSIGNED TO THE MISSION .
           (A) SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR EMBEDDED
           ALTERNATES:  EMBEDDED ALTERNATES WILL BE USED FOR IA
           REQUIREMENTS
WITH A LONGER AND MORE SPECIALIZED TRAINING PACKAGE.  EMBEDDED 
ALTERNATES WILL BE ASSIGNED TO THEIR OWN LINE NUMBER AND WILL RECEIVE 
ORDERS TO ATTEND THE TRAINING WITH OTHER PERSONNEL IN THAT MISSION.  
EMBEDDED ALTERNATES SHALL NOT BE NOMINATED FOR OTHER MISSIONS UNTIL 
AFTER THE PRIMARY HAS COMPLETED AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL 
BOOTS ON GROUND (BOG) LENGTH, UNLESS APPROVED BY USFF.
           (B) EMBEDDED ALTERNATE PREPARATION.  EMBEDDED
           ALTERNATES SHOULD BE BRIEFED OF THE HIGH PROBABILITY THEY 
WILL DEPLOY TO THEATER.  SAILORS IDENTIFIED AS EMBEDDED ALTERNATES MUST 
TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THEY CONTINUE TO REMAIN READY TO DEPLOY DURING THE 
FIRST 50 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL MISSION BOG PERIOD.  HOWEVER, EMBEDDED 
ALTERNATES SHALL NOT MAKE ANY IRREVERSIBLE DECISIONS SUCH AS RELOCATING 
A FAMILY MEMBER OR TERMINATING A LEASE UNTIL OFFICIALLY NOTIFIED THEY 
WILL BE REQUIRED TO GO FORWARD TO SUPPORT THE MISSION.
           (C) EMBEDDED ALTERNATE ACTIVATION.  THE MISSION
           COMMANDER, WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF USFF, SHALL ADVISE 
EMBEDDED ALTERNATES EITHER DURING TRAINING OR ONCE TRAINING IS COMPLETE 
IF THEY WILL GO FORWARD WITH THE REST OF THE PRIMARY MISSION PERSONNEL.  
IF THE EMBEDDED ALTERNATE DOES NOT INITIALLY GO FORWARD, THEY WILL BE 
RETURNED TO THEIR PARENT COMMAND AND CONSIDERED ON STAND-BY TO JOIN THE 
MISSION FOR 50 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL MISSION BOG DURATION.  IF A 
DECISION IS MADE TO ACTIVATE AN EMBEDDED ALTERNATE AFTER THE MISSION 
ARRIVES IN THEATER, USFF WILL NOTIFY THE BSO/TYCOM THAT MEMBER IS 
REQUIRED TO REPORT IN SUPPORT OF THE MISSION.  NEW ORDERS WILL BE ISSUED 
WITH A REPORT DATE THAT PROVIDES AT LEAST 14 DAYS NOTICE.
       (4) BOTH AUXILIARIES AND EMBEDDED ALTERNATES SHOULD BE
       MEDICALLY QUALIFIED AND READY TO DEPLOY WITH THEIR 
ADMINISTRATIVE, LEGAL AND PERSONAL AFFAIRS IN ORDER.  BSOS/TYCOMS ARE 
DIRECTED TO ENSURE PARENT COMMANDS CONDUCT A THOROUGH SCREENING OF ALL, 
PRIMARY, AUXILIARY, AND EMBEDDED ALTERNATE IA CANDIDATES.
    G.  PRE-DEPLOYMENT SCREENING.  THE IA EXPEDITIONARY SCREENING
    CHECKLIST WILL ASSIST PARENT COMMANDS IN IDENTIFYING ANY 
DISQUALIFYING ITEMS WITH A NOMINEE.  THE EXPEDITIONARY SCREENING 
CHECKLIST POSTED ON HTTP://WWW.IA.NAVY.MIL IS A REQUIRED ACTION FOR ALL 
IAS, PRIMARY, AUXILIARY, AND EMBEDDED ALTERNATES; AND SHALL BE COMPLETED 
WITHIN 30 DAYS OF IA ORDERS DATE.  ALL NON-QUALIFYING ISSUES MUST BE 
SUBMITTED TO USFF N1 VIA BSO/TYCOM IMMEDIATELY.  ADDITIONALLY, MANDATORY 
NKO COURSES ARE REQUIRED FOR ALL PRIMARY, AUXILIARY, AND EMBEDDED 
ALTERNATE CANDIDATES.  COMPLETION OF THESE PREPARATORY ACTIONS WILL HELP 
REDUCE FALLOUTS.

3.  WHILE EVERY EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO EXECUTE OSA, GSA AND IAMM 
BUSINESS RULES AS PUBLISHED IN NAVADMINS, THERE WILL BE CIRCUMSTANCES 
WHICH CANNOT BE ANTICIPATED.  THE NAVY IS COMMITTED TO FINDING THE BEST 
BALANCE BETWEEN THE IA MISSION, NEEDS/DESIRES OF THE SAILOR, AND COMMAND 
READINESS.  UNANTICIPATED DEMANDS MAY REQUIRE TAILORED SOLUTIONS NOT 
COVERED IN THESE BUSINESS RULES.

4.  YOUR EFFORTS TO DATE HAVE BEEN CRUCIAL TO ENSURING THE NAVY PROVIDES 
THE RIGHT SAILOR WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS AT THE RIGHT TIME TO MEET OUR 
NATION'S OCO SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS.  WE VALUE YOUR INPUT AS WE WORK TO 
IMPROVE THE PROCESS AND PROVIDE SAILORS, FAMILIES AND COMMANDS THE 
MAXIMUM POSSIBLE TIME TO PREPARE FOR THIS CRITICAL MISSION.
