RMKS/1.  Annually, the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) recognizes the 
Department of Defenses (DoD) most outstanding maintenance units.  I would 
like to personally extend my congratulations and gratitude for all Navy units 
that submitted nomination packages to the 2017 Secretary of Defense 
Maintenance Awards.  Each nominee should be proud of their accomplishments.

2.  Six units are awarded SECDEF Field-Level Maintenance Awards, two from 
each competitive category (small, medium, and large).  From these six winning 
units, one will be selected as the best of the best, and named the annual 
SECDEF Phoenix Award winner.  Additionally, one maintenance program from an 
organic depot-level maintenance activity is awarded the Robert T. Mason Award 
for Depot Maintenance Excellence.  The following Navy Command has been 
selected from a very competitive field of candidates across the entire 
Department of Defense as a Secretary of Defense winner in the Field-Level 
category:
Field-Level (Medium Category): ASSAULT CRAFT UNIT FOUR (ACU 4)
                               Fleet Maintenance Activity, Virginia
                               Beach, VA

3.  ACU 4 will be formally recognized on 5 December 2017 at the DoD 
Maintenance Symposium held in Salt Lake City, Utah.  The Phoenix Award winner 
will be announced at the Maintenance Symposium as well.

4.  The Maintenance Symposium is the Departments premier maintenance 
community event and will take place from 4-7 December 2017.  It is intended 
to be a forum to discuss key maintenance related topics and increase overall 
awareness of DoD maintenance initiatives. Maximum participation from the 
maintenance community is highly encouraged.  Interested personnel should 
register at http://www.sae.org/events/dod/. Contact Mr. Dan Schrader, POC 
info above, for further details.

5.  Please join me in congratulating the ACU 4 Fleet Maintenance Activity 
team for a job well done, you represent the very best of our military 
maintenance community which contributes directly to the readiness of our 
Navy.  BRAVO ZULU!
