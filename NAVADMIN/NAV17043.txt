RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces convening of the June 2017 Active Duty 
Officer Lateral Transfer/Redesignation Board.  The lateral transfer and 
redesignation process is a key tool by which Navy manages the talents of its 
officers.  It provides flexibility in officer community manning and improves 
the Navy’s return on investment in officer training and education by 
leveraging the specialized skillsets of officers throughout their careers.  
As part of the process, applications from qualified unrestricted line,
restricted line, staff corps, and limited duty officers (LDO) are now being 
accepted for an Active Duty Officer Lateral Transfer/Redesignation Board 
which convenes 5 June 2017.  Full-Time Support (FTS) and Selected Reserve 
(SELRES) officers are not eligible to apply for this board.

2.  In addition to the year group (YG) limitations imposed in paragraph 6, 
applicants must also meet eligibility requirements detailed in references (a) 
through (c), and are required to review and comply with any additional 
community requirements found in the June 2017 Letter of Instruction located 
at:  http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/boards/administrative/TransferRedesignation/Pages/Status.aspx.
    a.  Members who do not meet eligibility requirements per references (a) 
through (c) such as time-in-grade, years-of-commissioned service (YCS), or 
time-in-service must submit a waiver request in addition to or in conjunction 
with their lateral transfer/redesignation application as specified by 
specific communities.
    b.  Waiver request must include the officers waiver request letter and 
the commanding officers (CO) endorsement.  The CO may endorse the waiver in 
the same letter as the lateral transfer package endorsement.

3.  Submit applications and waiver request, using the format in reference 
(b), to the address below:

7.  Notes:
    a.  Must have Surface Warfare Officers (SWO) qualification completed to 
apply for transfer.  Officers under SWO Continuation Pay (SWOCP), Revised 
Junior Critical Skills Retention Bonus (RJCSRB), or Department Head Retention 
Bonus (DHRB) contract are not eligible for transfer until completion of bonus 
obligation.  SWOs serving under an agreement for any of the SWO bonuses are 
eligible to apply to the board if the board convening date is within one year 
of satisfaction of the full bonus obligation.  Quotas out may be limited due 
to manning levels for any given YG, the community's billet requirements, the 
status of DH contract goals for Year Groups with less than six years of 
commissioned service, and the individual officer's assignment status.  
Specifically, officers within their detailing window must communicate with 
their detailer prior to submitting a lateral transfer application.  Executing 
orders or slating to a billet will disqualify an officer for consideration 
and release from the community until arrival to the next duty station.
    b.  Waivers to the requirements of paragraph 4h of reference (b) for 
nuclear-trained surface and submarine warfare officers may be considered on a 
case-by-case basis.
    c.  Board applicants commissioned under a still-valid SWO-option 
agreement (Engineering Duty, Intel, IP, CW, OCEANO) must contact their 
respective restricted line option Community Manager regarding desire to be 
released from the SWO-option agreement and seek lateral transfer to a 
different community.
    d.  Nuclear-trained Surface Warfare Officers YG 11 and senior are 
available for lateral transfer consideration.
    e.  Officers screened "not cleared" for their next career milestone are 
eligible.
    f.  The YG range provided displays possible opportunities. Contact your 
specific community placement officer with questions regarding quota 
availability for each Type/Model/Series/Year Group. General aviation officers 
(1300) are eligible to apply for lateral transfer regardless of Active Duty 
Service Obligation (ADSO) from winging.  Aviation officers (131X and 132X) 
are eligible to apply for lateral transfer if the officer has fulfilled ADSO, 
or will be within 12 months of completing ADSO at the time the board 
convenes. Aviation officers with obligated service as a result of Aviation
Career Continuation Pay (ACCP) are eligible to apply if the officer will be 
within 12 months of completing ACCP obligation at the time the board 
convenes.  Additionally, aviation officers with obligated service as a result 
of ACCP are eligible to apply if the officer will be within 12 months of 
department head tour projected rotation date (PRD) at the time the board 
convenes, regardless of contrary ACCP contract language.  Redesignation 
immediately following department head tour may result in cancelation of ACCP, 
which will be adjudicated by PERS-43.  Aviation lieutenants in a Failure of
Selection (FOS) status to Lieutenant Commander are eligible to apply 
regardless of ADSO or ACCP obligation.  Graduates from U.S. Naval Test Pilot 
School class 148 and 149 may apply for AEDO only, regardless of ADSO (contact 
AEDO Officer Community Manager (OCM) for details).  If selected, aviation 
officers should not expect to redesignate until completion of ADSO, 
fulfillment/expiration/cancellation of ACCP contract, or PRD, as determined 
by Aviation OCM (BUPERS-313).  Officers selected to AEDO should expect to 
redesignate immediately.  Aviation officers in operational flying billets 
(billet designator XXX1 or XXX2) will not be permitted to redesignate until 
vacating the billet, typically at PRD.  BUPERS-313 authorizes redesignation 
timing.  By accepting a lateral transfer out of Aviation (13XX) an officer 
consents to voluntary termination of flight status (except for AEDO selects) 
effective the date of redesignation with the Lateral Transfer Application and 
CO's endorsement fulfilling the requirements set forth in reference (h).
    g.  Engineering Duty Community
        (1) Applicants desiring out quota from Engineering Duty (ED):
            (a) ED out-quotas are extremely limited.  Redesignation requests 
must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis with careful consideration given to 
impact on overall community health.
            (b) Applicants must have fulfilled at least 24 months of their 
postgraduate education payback tour in order to apply.
        (2) Applicants desiring redesignation to Engineering Duty:
            (a) Officers without a warfare qualification are expected to 
submit an application for the ED Dolphin Program per reference (i).
            (b) Applicants from YGs 14-11 (para 6C) are desired with YG 13 
having the highest anticipated inventory requirement. Inventory requirements 
for YGs 10-06 are met however, well qualified officers, especially those 
already possessing qualifying subspecialty codes or currently engaged in 
technical masters program leading to qualifying subspecialty codes, may be 
considered in limited instances.
    h.  Civil Engineer Corps (CEC) officers under CEC Critical Skills 
Retention Bonus (CSRB) contract are eligible to apply to the board if the 
board application due date is within one year of satisfaction of the full 
bonus obligation.  Officers with more than one year of obligation remaining 
on their CEC CSRB contract may submit a waiver to be released prior to 
fulfillment of their bonus obligation.  Waivers must be submitted to the CEC 
OCM for review on a case-by-case basis and can be submitted with the 
application.  If approved, the notice of approval for early release from the 
CSRB contract must be included with the lateral transfer application.
Release from the CSRB contract will be considered a voluntary release subject 
to repayment of any unearned amount.
    i.  LDO redesignation requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, 
considering impact to overall community health.  Nuclear LDO submissions will 
not be considered.  All other designators must have completed four years 
commissioned service and accepted permanent LDO appointment to Lieutenant 
prior to lateral transfer/redesignation.  LDO out quotas are extremely 
limited but special consideration will be given to officers projected to be 
statutorily separated for years of service prior to attaining the rank of 
Commander.  Information Warfare Community applicants in YG's 12 and senior 
will receive favorable consideration.
    j.  Officers YG 13 and senior seeking lateral transfer into the Surface 
Warfare Community are strongly encouraged to contact the SWO Community 
Manager prior to applying in order to discuss critical SWO career milestone 
requirements.
    k.  Naval Special Warfare (NSW) will no longer consider or select lateral 
transfers via this board.  All applicants will be considered by a separate 
NSW selection process (applicants YG 14 and junior are desired) and must 
submit their application directly to the SEAL OCM.  More information, 
including required application contents and submission due dates, can be 
found on the SEAL OCM website:  http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/communitymanagers/Unrestricted/nsw/Pages/SEALOfficerSelection.asp
x.
    l.  Warfare qualified officers in YG 14 and junior seeking lateral 
transfer into the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Community are strongly 
encouraged to contact the EOD OCM prior to applying in order to discuss 
critical EOD career milestone requirements.  All applicants must be eligible 
for TS/SCI security clearance, worldwide assignable, meet requirements in 
references (d) and (e), interview with an EOD Officer (Lieutenant or above), 
and pass a physical screening test per reference (f).  EOD Limited Duty 
Officers (6480) in YGs 03-06 will be considered for lateral transfer and 
redesignation as an EOD Officer (1140).
    m.  Officers in all eligible YGs with Operations Analysis (OA) 
subspecialty (321X) and/or those with an Academic Profile Code (APC) of 325 
or better are encouraged to apply to Human Resources.
    n.  YG 12 has highest anticipated inventory requirement. Inventory 
requirements for YG 08 are met.  However, the Community is targeting 
increased inventory for OA subspecialists.  YG 08 applicants with 321X 
subspecialty from completed graduate education and/or experience tours are 
planned for referral to the board.  This is the last planned opportunity for 
YG 05 applicants for lateral transfer.
    o.  HR applicants without a masters degree resulting in 3XXX 
subspecialty, must request to have their APC calculated by Naval Postgraduate 
School prior to the board convening date (apply online:
https://my.nps.edu/web/admissions/apply).  Applicants without an APC by 
application suspense must include a copy of their undergraduate transcript 
with their application.
    p.  Officers who are 1xFOS for Lieutenant Commander will not be 
considered for lateral transfer to 1510.  Aviation officers (13XX) are 
eligible and may apply for 1510 (only) regardless of ADSO if they are a 
graduate of U.S. Naval Test Pilot School class 148 or class 149.
    q.  Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the Aerospace

        (1) Applicants should have their language abilities documented by a 
recent (taken within three years of the board convening) Defense Language 
Proficiency Test (DLPT) and (if possible) oral proficiency interview (OPI).  
DLPT/OPI level 2 or higher is a qualifying score but is not required for 
applicants of YG 07 and junior.  A Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) 
is required for applicants, and the results never expire.  A minimum
DLAB score of 95 is required, and a score greater than 120 is highly 
desirable.
        (2) Applicants without a regionally-focused masters degree should
