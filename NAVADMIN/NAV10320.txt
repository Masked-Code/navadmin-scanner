SUBJ/ALASKA SEA SERVICES SCHOLARSHIP FOR ACADEMIC YEAR 2011-2012//   

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE REQUIREMENTS AND SOLICITS       
APPLICATIONS FOR THE ALASKA SEA SERVICES SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM.  THE   
ALASKA SEA SERVICES SCHOLARSHIP ANNUALLY AWARDS UP TO FOUR $1,000    
SCHOLARSHIPS FOR UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION TO DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND   
SPOUSES OF NAVY, MARINE CORPS, AND COAST GUARD PERSONNEL WHO LEGALLY

2.  BACKGROUND.  CITIZENS OF ALASKA RAISED FUNDS FOR A $10,000 WAR   
BOND AS A GIFT TO THE USS JUNEAU (CL 52) DURING WORLD WAR II.  AFTER 
THE SINKING OF THE USS JUNEAU, THIS GIFT WAS TO HAVE BEEN PRESENTED  
TO THE USS ALASKA (CB 1), BUT THE USS ALASKA WAS DECOMMISSIONED      
BEFORE THE PRESENTATION.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE GOVERNOR OF THE          
TERRITORY OF ALASKA AND THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY AGREED THAT THE    
BOND WOULD BE LEFT ON DEPOSIT IN THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF JUNEAU   
UNTIL THE USS ALASKA WAS RECOMMISSIONED OR ANOTHER APPROPRIATE       
APPLICATION COULD BE FOUND.  IN 1986, THE NAVY ESTABLISHED THE
