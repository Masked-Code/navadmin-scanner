RMKS/1.  Sailors live our Core Values every day.  However, recent events 
highlight that the U.S. Armed Forces, including our Navy (service members, 
civilian personnel and all those who support our mission), are not immune 
from the corrosive effects of extremist ideology and conduct.  Extremist 
behaviors and conduct, even if from only a small percentage of our force, 
violate our Core Values, are detrimental to good order and discipline, reduce 
warfighting readiness and degrade the toughness, trust and connectedness we 
are building in our Sailors and teams through our Culture of Excellence 
campaign.
As an initial step in what will be a continuing and focused effort to address 
this problem, Commanders and Commanding Officers will conduct a stand-down 
prior to 2 April 2021 for all military personnel and Department of the Navy 
(DON) civilians to address extremism in the ranks in accordance with guidance 
contained in references (a) and (b).

2.  The intent of this stand-down (which may be conducted virtually or in-
person with the appropriate COVID-19
mitigations) is to ensure service members and civilian personnel clearly 
understand the damaging effects of extremism and begin developing more 
effective, sustainable ways to eliminate the corrosive impacts extremist 
activity can have on our Force.  As public servants, we took an oath to the 
Constitution and we will not tolerate those who participate in actions that 
go against the fundamental principles of the oath we share, particularly 
actions associated with extremist or dissident ideologies.  Service members, 
Department of Defense civilians and all those who support our mission, are 
entitled to an environment free of discrimination, hate and harassment.

3.  A discussion guide, supplementary slides, and additional resources to 
assist Commanders and Commanding Officers with the conduct of this stand-down 
are posted at
https://www.navy.mil/Leadership/Chief-of-Naval-Personnel/CNP-
Department-Exclusives/ .  Commanders have the discretion to tailor 
discussions with their personnel as appropriate, but at a minimum the stand-
down will include:
    3.A. A group re-administration and reaffirmation of the oath of 
office/oath of enlistment;
    3.B. Remarks from the Commander/Commanding Officer;
    3.C. Division/Work Center training/facilitated discussion
addressing:
        3.C.1. The meaning of the oath of office/enlistment including what we 
protect (Freedom of Speech/Assembly) and the limits on these rights for 
service members (what we sacrifice in order to protect and build public 
trust);
        3.C.2. Actions that betray the oath per references (c) through (e) 
(prohibited activities, UCMJ direction on extremist activities, review of 
political activity and social media dos and donts);
        3.C.3. The responsibility of leaders at every level (obligation to 
report, obligation to investigate, remaining alert for signs of extremism and 
then intervening);
        3.C.4. Listening sessions focused on our Core Values, our Culture of 
Excellence and the Task Force One Navy report.

4.  We have been emphasizing the importance of listening sessions since the 
establishment of Task Force One Navy last summer.  Some commands have leaned 
into this while others have not.  CNOs direction is that every Commander or 
Commanding Officer will continue to conduct listening sessions and get it 
into their battle rhythm.  This is where the hard work of establishing trust 
and connectedness starts.  Reference (g), the Necessary Conversations Guide 
2.1, is a great tool to use to conduct listening sessions.

5.  Echelon 2 Commanders shall track subordinate command completion of the 
stand-down using Fleet Training Management and Planning System (FLTMPS), 
Course Identification Number SDTAE-1.0, STANDDOWN TO ADDRESS EXTREMISM IN THE 
RANKS.  The Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Manpower, Personnel, Training, 
and Education) (OPNAV N1) will promulgate procedures for Echelon 2 Commanders 
to submit stand-down completion reports (including lessons learned and 
recommendations) via a Department of the Navy Tasking, Records and 
Consolidated Knowledge Repository (DONTRACKER) tasker.  In order to support 
the requirement for the Chief of Naval Operations to report completion to the 
Secretary of the Navy by 6 April 2021, the suspense for all Echelon 2 
Commanders to report stand-down completion is no later than 2 April 2021.  In 
the event operational requirements prohibit the conduct of the stand- down by 
this date, extension requests must be submitted through the first Flag 
Officer in the chain of command, via the Chief of Naval Personnel, and 
ultimately to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve 
Affairs) for adjudication per reference (b).

6.  As Sailors, we must strive to be inclusive, creating an environment where 
every individual understands that they are a valued member of the Navy team.  
This is an All Hands effort.
As we begin to implement the work of Task Force One Navy, I remind you of the 
Signature Behaviors promulgated in reference (f).  These behaviors include:
    6.A. Treat every person with respect.
    6.B. Take responsibility for my actions.
    6.C. Hold others accountable for their actions.
    6.D. Intervene when necessary.
    6.E. Be a leader and encourage leadership in others.
    6.F. Grow personally and professionally every day.
    6.G. Embrace the diversity of ideas, experiences and backgrounds of 
individuals.
    6.H. Uphold the highest degree of integrity in professional and personal 
life.
    6.I. Exercise discipline in conduct and performance.
    6.J. Contribute to team success through actions and attitude.

7.  As CNO stated in reference (h), today, and every day, our Navy must be a 
shining example of an organization centered on respect, inclusive of all.  
Simply put, we must demand of each other that we treat everyone with dignity 
and respect.  That is how we will become a stronger Navy.
