RMKS/1.  In line with recent reforms of the Defense Officer Personnel 
Management Act (DOPMA), this NAVADMIN announces the opportunity for Active 
Component (AC) and Full-Time Support (FTS) unrestricted line (URL) officers 
to request to defer promotion selection board (PSB) consideration for the 
fiscal year (FY) 2023 PSB and restates the policy and procedural guidance for 
submitting a request. 
 
2.  References (a) through (c) authorize the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) 
to approve the request of an officer to defer promotion consideration by a 
PSB convened under references (e) and (f). Reference (d) delegates approval 
authority to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve 
Affairs) (ASN(MRA)). 
ASN(MRA) may only approve a request if: 
    a.  The basis for the request is to allow an officer to complete a 
broadening assignment, advanced education, or another assignment of 
significant value to the Department of the Navy or a career progression 
requirement delayed by the assignment or education. 
    b.  ASN(MRA) determines the exclusion from consideration is in the best 
interest of the Department of the Navy. 
    c.  The officer has not previously failed of selection for promotion to 
the grade for which the officer requests the exclusion from consideration. 
 
3.  Eligible Officers.  All AC and FTS URL officers who are eligible to be 
considered as an in-zone or above-zone not previously considered, eligible 
for promotion to lieutenant commander, commander, or captain in FY-23, who 
meet one or more of the base requirements in paragraph 2.a and the 
requirements of paragraph 2.c, may submit a request to defer PSB 
consideration. 
    a.  Examples of broadening assignments include, but are not limited to: 
        (1) White House Fellowship. 
        (2) Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellowship. 
        (3) Federal Executive Fellowships (e.g., politico-military and 
cyber). 
        (4) SECNAV tours with industry. 
    b.  Examples of advanced education include, but are not limited to: 
        (1) Competitive education programs (e.g., Olmsted, Marshall, Rhodes, 
Fleet Scholar). 
        (2) In-residence Naval Postgraduate School or Naval War College. 
        (3) Equivalent service institutions or in-residence civilian 
education programs. 
    c.  Examples of another assignment of significant value include, but are 
not limited to: 
        (1) Defense or naval attach. 
        (2) The personnel exchange program. 
 
4.  Requests 
    a.  Requests shall include: 
        (1) A description of the broadening assignment, advanced education, 
assignment of significant value, or career progression requirement delayed by 
the assignment or education. 
        (2) Justification for requesting PSB consideration opt-out. 
        (3) An endorsement recommendation from his or her commanding officer 
or equivalent. 
    b.  E-mail requests to Bureau of Naval Personnel, Active Community 
Managers (BUPERS-31) (bupers3_optout.fct(at)navy.mil). 
    c.  All requests must be received via e-mail no later than 24 August 
2021. 
    d.  Officers with assignments in excess of 12 months must annually 
request to defer consideration for PSBs. 
 
5.  Staffing and review.  Officer requests shall be reviewed by a panel of, 
at a minimum, an Officer Community Management Branch (BUPERS-3) URL community 
manager (for nuclear trained officers the Officer and Enlisted Nuclear 
Programs Policy Branch (OPNAV N133), shall be included on the panel), a Navy 
Personnel Command Career Management Branch (PERS-4) officer detailer, and one 
additional officer, all senior to the officer requesting to defer PSB 
consideration.  The panel will forward its recommendation to ASN(MRA) via the 
community sponsor of the officer and the Chief of Naval Personnel (CNP). 
 
6.  Recommendations of PSB consideration deferment requests will be based on 
the service of an officer in a broadening assignment, advanced education, or 
assignment of significant value, overall performance history, and ability to 
complete career progression requirements.  In-residence graduate education 
has been established as a career path requirement for the most fully 
qualified, due course officers in year group 2015 and beyond, which in the 
future is expected to address most cases that the deferral policy is intended 
for.  Therefore, this policy is not intended to mitigate non-traditional 
detailing but rather is intended for the rare exceptions to normal career 
progression. 
 
7.  URL community sponsor review.  The URL community flag officer sponsor for 
requesting officers shall provide a recommendation concerning all PSB 
consideration deferral requests to ASN(MRA) via CNP.  The community sponsor 
should consider the documented performance history of the officer and ability 
to provide future benefit to the Navy.  For disapproval recommendations, the 
community sponsor shall state the reasons for the disapproval recommendation, 
which may include but are not limited to, too many *off-track* assignments, 
performance issues, or failure to already screen for milestone prior to 
promotion opportunity. 
 
8.  CNP review.  All recommendations to CNP shall include community flag 
officer sponsor endorsements.  CNP will review all relevant information and 
recommendations and recommend approval or disapproval to the ASN(MRA) for 
final decision. 
 
9.  Officers will be notified via letter of approval or disapproval of their 
request no later than 45 calendar days before the proposed convening date of 
the first PSB of the FY promotion cycle. 
 
10.  Officers that are approved for PSB deferment, but are subsequently 
determined to be below-zone, will be considered below-zone by the 
PSB.  Officers selected for promotion after deferring PSB consideration will 
establish a new promotion year group based on their resulting date of 
rank.  Those officers will be considered by future administrative and 
statutory PSBs with the new promotion year group.  The records of officers 
with approved deferrals of promotion consideration will not be identified or 
made known to any administrative or statutory PSB.

Board Deferment (Opt-Out) Guidance.  The point of contact for this matter is

e-mail at kimberly.riddle(at)navy.mil. 
 
12.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or until 
1 January 2022, whichever occurs first.
