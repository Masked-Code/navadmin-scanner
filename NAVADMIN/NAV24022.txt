RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN implements a confidential reporting option, in 
addition to the informal, formal, and anonymous complaint processes, for 
Service Members who experience sexual harassment, as directed by references 
(a) and (b).  For our Navy to prepare for and dominate in combat, we must 
have strong teams.  The strength of our teams depends upon the strength of 
our people:  the professional and personal development of Service Members to 
be tough and resilient in Mind, Body, and Spirit is critical.  Reinforcing 
prevention and supportive intervention when needed throughout Navy commands 
is a key principle in meeting the needs of our people and our teams. 
 
2.  Effective immediately, this confidential sexual harassment reporting 
process is available for Service Members.  A confidential sexual harassment 
report can only be submitted to a Command Climate Specialist (CCS) or a 
Command Managed Equal Opportunity (CMEO) program manager. 
    a.  The CCS or CMEO program manager will inform the reporting Service 
Member's Commanding Officer (CO) or commander of a confidential report within 
24 hours of receipt; however, they must not disclose the identity or any 
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of the Service Member submitting 
the report. 
    b.  A confidential report does not trigger an investigation or 
disciplinary action. 
    c.  A confidential report allows the Service Member to access the support 
and referral services outlined in references (c), (d), and (e). 
    d.  For CCS contact information, Service Members should contact the CMEO 
program manager or the Navy Harassment and Military Equal Opportunity Office 
(OPNAV N170C) at MILL_Navy_EO_Advice@navy.mil. 
 
3.  The CCS and CMEO program managers are subject matter experts within a 
command for advising Service Members on the different avenues of redress and 
advising COs and commanders on the handling and processing of sexual 
harassment complaints. 
 
4.  When approached by a Service Member alleging sexual harassment, the CCS 
or CMEO program manager must explain the informal, formal, and anonymous 
complaint processes outlined in reference (d), and the confidential reporting 
process outlined in this NAVADMIN.  This must include: 
    a.  The options available to submit an informal, formal, anonymous 
complaint, or a confidential report of sexual harassment. 
    b.  The different aspects of each avenue and the manner in which the 
complaint will be investigated, if at all.  The CCS or CMEO program manager 
should explain that formal complaints must be referred to the appropriate 
commander within three duty days, and are not considered confidential 
reports. 
    c.  Identification of support and referral services available to the 
Service Member outlined in references (c), (d), and (e). 
    d.  A confidential report of sexual harassment will not result in an 
investigation or disciplinary action except in situations described in 
paragraph 5(b). 
    e.  A confidential report of sexual harassment does not prevent a Service 
Member from changing the report to an informal, formal, or anonymous 
complaint in line with reference (d). 
 
5.  When a CCS or CMEO program manager takes a confidential report of sexual 
harassment from a Service Member, the CCS or CMEO program manager must: 
    a.  Maintain the confidentiality of the Service Member. 
    b.  Explain to the Service Member that confidentiality will be maintained 
unless: 
        (1) The CCS or CMEO program manager is called to testify as a witness 
at a court-martial or administrative hearing relating to the report of sexual 
harassment; or 
        (2) A trained Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC), CCS, CMEO 
program manager, or other qualified and trained personnel conducts a safety 
assessment and identifies there is a high risk to the health or safety of the 
Service Member or another person.  The SARC, CCS, or CMEO program manager 
must immediately report these concerns to the Service Member's CO or 
commander. 
        (3) The Service Member elects to change a confidential report to an 
informal or formal complaint. 
    c.  Explain the informal, formal, and anonymous complaint processes if 
this has not already been done. 
    d.  Identify available counseling support and other support services for 
which the Service Member is eligible. 
    e.  Document the confidential report on the Navy Equal Opportunity (EO) 
and Sexual Harassment Report (NAVPERS 5354/2). 
Documentation must only include the command or local resources contact 
information, the alleged behavior, the command name, and command unit 
identification code for both the complainant and alleged offender. 
    f.  Provide a copy of the NAVPERS 5354/2 to the Service Member and 
forward a copy to OPNAV N170C via e-mail at MILL_Navy_EO_Advice@navy.mil. 
 
6.  If the alleged sexual harassment also involves behavior that may be 
sexual assault, to include sexual contact, the CCS or CMEO program manager 
must, with the Service Member's permission, ensure a warm hand-off to the 
SARC or the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Victim Advocate (SAPR VA), 
as outlined in reference (e). 
The SARC or SAPR VA are responsible for all reporting requirements and case 
management, as appropriate, for sexual assault allegations including command 
notification as required.  The CCS or CMEO program manager will be 
responsible for all requirements outlined within this NAVADMIN for the sexual 
harassment allegations. 
 
7.  No Wrong Door.  If a Service Member discloses sexual harassment directly 
to a SARC or SAPR VA, those personnel will: 
    a.  Assist the Service Member to address any immediate safety 
needs.  Immediately notify the Service Member's CO or commander of any high 
risk situation. 
    b.  With the Service Member's permission, conduct a warm hand-off, as 
outlined in reference (e), to the CCS or CMEO program manager for the Service 
Member to receive an explanation of available redress options.  If a Service 
Member declines the warm hand-off, the SARC or SAPR VA is not required to 
notify the Service Member's CO or commander, the CCS, or the CMEO program 
manager. 
 
8.  OPNAV N170C will set up several town halls for CCSs and CMEO program 
managers to discuss and answer questions about the new confidential reporting 
option for sexual harassment.  Town hall dates will be posted on  
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/Culture-Resilience/Equal-
Opportunity/Command-Climate-Specialists/ /. 
 
9.  Service Members who have additional questions should contact the Navy 
Harassment and Military Equal Opportunity Advice line at (800) 253-0931,  
or via e-mail at MILL_Navy_EO_Advice@navy.mil. 
 
10.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
