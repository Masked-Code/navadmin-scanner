RMKS/1.  Reference (a) was a result of the independent public accountant 
notification of findings and recommendations of military permanent change of 
station (MILPCS) travel liquidations.  The auditor identified a deficiency 
that controls over travel voucher submission were not operating effectively 
due to travel vouchers not being submitted within five working days following 
the Service Members reporting to their ultimate duty station and not in 
compliance with reference (b).

2.  In addition, the Navy did not provide sufficient evidence to support 
whether the voucher was submitted within the required five working days due 
to lack of endorsements on the orders as required in reference (c) (i.e. 
date, time, and place of reporting).

3.  Non-compliance with references (b) and (c) impact Sailors entitlements, 
the timely recording of financial transactions, and result in overall 
misstatement of Department of the Navy financial records.

4.  Timely resolution of reference (a) requires all commands immediate 
compliance and enforcement of MILPCS travel policies and procedures per 
references (b) and (c) and retention of all supporting documents in 
accordance with reference (d).

5.  Point of contact is Mr. Dan Mendoza, Audit Readiness Programs, at (703) 
604-5883/DSN 664 or via e-mail at danilo.r.mendoza(at)navy.mil.
