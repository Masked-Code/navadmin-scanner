RMKS/1.  Based on Fleet feedback, the Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of 
Naval Operations directed expansion of our ball cap policy.
Effective 1 September 2014, the Navy and command ball cap may be worn in lieu 
of the eight-point cover with the Navy Working Uniform
(NWU) Type I, II and III in accordance with reference (a).

2.  Command ball caps are organizational clothing that may be purchased with 
appropriated funds and issued in accordance with reference (a), chapter 6, 
article 6801.  Sailors may purchase command ball caps with their personal 
funds, just as they purchase command badges, patches, belt buckles and other 
permissible uniform items.  Additionally, wardrooms, chief petty officer 
messes, first class petty officer associations, junior enlisted associations, 
and other similar organizations may purchase command ball caps with their 
funds.  The use of morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) non-appropriated 
funds to purchase command ball caps is prohibited per DoDI 1015.15 and CNIC 
Instruction 1710.3.

3.  The eight-point cover will remain the basic uniform component cover for 
the NWUs and thus will be the only appropriate cover for personnel uniform 
inspections and special occasions where Sailors are ordered to wear their 
NWUs with eight-point cover to ensure a uniform appearance within the 
command.  The Navy and command ball cap will remain authorized, optional head 
gear worn with navy flight suits, navy blue coveralls, flame resistant 
coveralls, and the Navy physical training uniform.

4.  The manner of wear and description of the Navy and command ball caps 
remain as noted in reference (a), chapter 3, article 3501.8.
No other items,
ornamentation, or insignia other than specified in reference (a) is 
authorized for wear on the ball cap.

5.  This NAVADMIN supersedes paragraph 6.C.(3) of reference (b), paragraph 5 
of reference (c), and paragraph 1.C. of reference (d), and authorizes the 
optional wear of Navy and command ball caps with the NWU Type I, II and III 
until reference (a) is updated to reflect the change.

6.  Questions regarding occasion for wear should be directed to your 
commanding officer and regional commanders.  General questions and comments 
regarding this NAVADMIN should be addressed to the Uniform Matters Office, 
OPNAV N131U, via e-mail at:  Mr. Robert B. Carroll, 
robert.b.carroll(at)navy.mil; CMDCM(SW/AW) Rita N. Carman, 
rita.carman(at)navy.mil; or PS1(SW) Andrew S. Lucio, 
andrew.lucio(at)navy.mil.

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.

8.  Released by Vice Admiral W. F. Moran, N1.//
