SUBJ/GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM (GWOT) SUPPORT ASSIGNMENTS (GSA) UPDATE// 
RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES AN UPDATE ON GSA DETAILING.  GSA 
DETAILING PHASE I BEGAN IN JUNE 2007, INITIATING THE TRANSITION OF OUR 
INDIVIDUAL AUGMENTATION (IA) PROCESS FROM ONE BASED UPON SHORT NOTICE, 
MID-TOUR, TEMPORARY DUTY IA ASSIGNMENTS, TO A MORE PREDICTABLE EVENT 
WITHIN THE NORMAL PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION
(PCS) ASSIGNMENT PROCESS, NEGOTIATED WITHIN A SAILOR'S NORMAL DETAILING 
WINDOW.  BUILDING UPON THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM PHASE I, WE ARE NOW 
READY TO IMPLEMENT GSA DETAILING PHASE II.
2.  OUR GOAL IS TO FULLY IMPLEMENT GSA DETAILING AS RAPIDLY AS 
PRACTICABLE.  CUMULATIVELY, PHASE I AND II WILL BRING 73 PERCENT OF OUR 
ACTIVE COMPONENT (AC) IA REQUIREMENTS (AROUND 3,500 BILLETS) INTO THE 
GSA DETAILING SYSTEM.  OUR INTENT IS TO ACHIEVE GREATER SAILOR, FAMILY, 
AND COMMAND PREDICTABILITY WITHIN THE IA PROCESS, AND INCREASE COMMAND 
MANNING STABILITY.  HERE ARE ADDITIONAL DETAILS CONCERNING THE GSA 
DETAILING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
    A.  PHASE I INCLUDES ALMOST 1,300 JOINT MANNING DOCUMENT (JMD) 
DRIVEN, GWOT SUPPORT BILLETS (APPROXIMATELY 27 PERCENT OF CURRENT IA
REQUIREMENTS) AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE FOR REFILL FROM JUNE 2007 TO 
DECEMBER 2008.  THE FIRST COHORT OF SAILORS DETAILED UNDER GSA PHASE I 
WILL ARRIVE AT THE EXPEDITIONARY COMBAT READINESS CENTER IN JANUARY 
2008.
    B.  PHASE II ENCOMPASSES ALL REMAINING STABLE REFILL REQUIREMENTS 
(ABOUT 2,300 BILLETS), AND WILL ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 46 PERCENT OF 
CURRENT IA REQUIREMENTS AS THEY COME UP FOR REFILL FROM OCTOBER 2007 TO 
APRIL 2009.
    C.  PHASE III, DIRECTED AT NEW AND EMERGENT FILLS (APPROXIMATELY 
1,300 BILLETS OR 27 PERCENT OF ALL AC REQUIREMENTS) WILL BEGIN IN 
SPRING 2008.
3.  AS WE TRANSITION TO FULLY IMPLEMENTING GSA DETAILING, TWO 
SIMULTANEOUS PROCESSES FOR SOURCING THE NAVY?S IA MISSION WILL
EXIST: GSA DETAILING AND THE LEGACY IA PROCESS.  THOSE DETAILED UNDER 
THE GSA PROCESS WILL NOT CONSTITUTE THE GREATER PORTION OF GWOT SUPPORT 
UNTIL LATE 2008.  UNTIL THEN, THE MAJORITY OF IAS WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
FILLED VIA THE LEGACY IA PROCESS. 
4.  BRINGING MORE OF OUR GWOT SUPPORT INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF OUR 
DETAILING PROCESSES IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR OUR SAILORS, THEIR 
FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMANDS, AND IS THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE OUR COMBAT 
MISSION IS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE RIGHT SAILOR, WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS, AT 
THE RIGHT TIME FOR THE SAILOR?S CAREER PROGRESSION.
