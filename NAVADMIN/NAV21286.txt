RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the phased roll-out for mandatory 
use of the government travel charge card (GTCC) for all permanent 
change of station (PCS) travel as well as mandatory use of the MyPCS 
Travel Voucher for submission of travel claim vouchers by PCS 
travelers when the ultimate duty station is supported by Transaction 
Service Centers or Personnel Support Detachments.  The MyPCS Travel 
Voucher is a fully automated, electronic travel claim voucher 
capability introduced to the Fleet in September 2019. 
 
2.  In line with references (a) and (b), starting 1 January 2022, 
use of the GTCC for PCS travel and submission of travel claim 
vouchers via the MyPCS Travel Voucher will be mandatory as outlined 
in the below phases: 
    a.  Phase I, effective 1 January 2022.  All Active Duty and 
Full-Time Support (FTS) in the paygrades of E-9 as well as O-6 and 
above. 
    b.  Phase II, effective 1 July 2022.  All Active Duty and FTS 
members in all paygrades. 
    c.  Mandated use of the MyPCS Travel Voucher is also expanded to 
include Selected Reservists executing Active Duty for Operational 
Support and Officer Recall PCS orders. 
 
3.  GTCC Program Background.  Reference (c) expanded use of the GTCC 
during PCS travel for Active Duty and FTS Sailors.  Use of the GTCC 
complies with Department of Defense (DoD) policy and enhances 
accountability and auditability of PCS expenditures and related 
entitlements.  The GTCC provides a reliable, interest-free means of 
financial support to Sailors and their families during a PCS move. 
 
4.  MyPCS Travel Voucher Background.  The expanded automation of 
processing PCS travel claim vouchers using the MyPCS Travel Voucher 
greatly reduces error rate, expedites reimbursement and reduces 
back-office administrative workload.  Use of the MyPCS Travel 
Voucher has been piloted with positive feedback from PCS travelers 
and command pay and personnel administrators (CPPA). 
 
5.  GTCC Program Education and Policy 
    a.  This NAVADMIN mandates use of the GTCC for PCS purposes and 
ceases the issuance of travel advances. 
        (1) Exceptions to the issuance of travel advances will be 
restricted to non-concurrent travel of dependents and for Sailors 
not eligible to receive a GTCC.  Travel advance payments must be 
requested through submission of the Navy Pay and Personnel Support 
Center Application for Transfer and Advances Form (NPPSC 1300/1). 
        (2) The GTCC is authorized for dislocation allowance (DLA) 
expenses.  If desired, a Sailor under PCS orders may request advance 
DLA.  If advance DLA is requested, the GTCC shall not be used for 
DLA expenses. 
    b.  Paragraphs 4.b and 4.c of reference (c) outlines permitted 
and prohibited uses of the GTCC for PCS purposes. 
    c.  GTCC use during personally procured moves (PPM) is 
authorized for Sailors conducting PCS moves within the 48 contiguous 
states and Washington, D.C. 
        (1) Prior to conducting a PPM, Sailors using the GTCC for 
PPMs must receive counseling from their local household goods (HHG) 
office. 
        (2) The GTCC shall not be used to obtain, arrange for, or 
pay for short term (storage in transit-SIT) or long-term (non- 
temporary storage-NTS) storage of PPMs or for any government 
reimbursable storage of HHG. 
 
6.  MyPCS Travel Voucher Overview, Accessibility and Training 
    a.  The MyPCS Travel Voucher is a fully automated and electronic 
travel claim voucher capability for Sailors available on personal 
and government mobile devices, tablets, laptops and desktops. 
Reference (d) provides detailed capabilities available for the PCS 
traveler as well as the command CPPA. 
    b.  PCS travelers can navigate to the PCS move experience via 
their mobile browser using commercial-grade multi-factor 
authentication (MFA) credentialing which enables common access card 
(CAC)-free access.  The MyPCS Travel Voucher is available via 
accessing MyPCS Mobile on the Navy App Locker at 
https://www.applocker.navy.mil/#!/apps or MyNavy Portal (MNP) website at 
https://my.navy.mil/.  MNP has quick links available on the MNP 
homepage.  By downloading the Navy App Locker for either Android or 
Apple devices, Sailors can quickly access the MyPCS Mobile and other 
Navy-sponsored content.  Sailors can access the MyPCS Mobile website 
without a CAC using commercial grade MFA credentials for security. 
    c.  To set up CAC-free access, login is required into MNP on a 
CAC-enabled machine.  Your name should appear at the top of the 
page.  Click on your name, select my account, then select the 
instructions for CAC-free setup.  Follow the steps for either Apple 
iOS or Google Android to authenticate your identity under the 
instructions tab.  This is a one-time event and allows the user to 
establish their secure MFA account to log into the CAC-less 
applications or websites.  The mobile device of the user must have 
access to either WiFi or cellular data services to complete the 
process. 
    d.  User productivity kits (UPK) are available for PCS travelers 
with a valid CAC on MNP.  Click on NP2 - My PCS and More.  To access 
available training resources, scroll toward the bottom of the 
landing page and under Training, select the UPK for Assignments, 
Leave and Travel (ALT) and select either ALT (Mobile Friendly) or 
ALT (Desktop), as desired. 
 
7.  Responsibilities 
    a.  In line with references (a) and (b), commanding officers and 
CPPAs shall ensure Sailors submit PCS travel claim vouchers along 
with supporting receipts within five working days of reporting to 
their new duty station and adhere to DoD policy requirement 
mandating split disbursement. 
 
8.  Benefits and Remittance of Due Payment 
    a.  Use of the GTCC reduces out of pocket expenses.  Users are 
not charged interest or required to remit payment for up to 60 days 
from end of mission critical-PCS (MC/PCS) status.  Sailors will be 
placed in MC/PCS status upon detaching from their command and will 
remain in MC/PCS status until they report to their ultimate duty 
station or for 120 days, whichever comes first.  If there are delays 
in reporting or PCS orders are longer than 120 days, Sailors and 
agency program coordinators (APC) shall verify the GTCC is placed 
back in a MC/PCS status. 
    b.  Failure to reimburse the GTCC within 60 days of ending 
MC/PCS status may result in account delinquency and may adversely 
impact the Sailors assignability, security clearance and credit 
history. 
    c.  It is imperative Sailors, CPPAs, APCs and command leadership 
clearly understand their roles and responsibilities and take actions 
necessary to avoid outstanding travel debt. 
 
9.  Customer support is available 24/7 from the MyNavy Career Center 
Human Resources Shared Service Center at 833-330-MNCC (6622) or via 
e-mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil. 
 
10.  Reference (e) highlights GTCC use during PCS lessons learned. 
To continue to evaluate program effectiveness, GTCC users are strongly 
encouraged to complete a brief survey available at 
https://surveys.max.gov/index.php/737856?lang=en. 
 
11.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
