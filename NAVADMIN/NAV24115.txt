4. The focus of the New Year's Day Deck Log contest is to celebrate the 
voices of our Sailors and to preserve a Navy tradition. A deck log is the 
official record maintained by all commissioned U.S. Navy vessels. While 
regulations normally restrict the types of entries in logbooks, the Navy has 
long held the tradition of the Midnight New Year's Poem. The first entry of 
the New Year, written in verse, allows Sailors to express their creativity 
about the experiences of shipboard life and their pride in their command. The 
contest also serves to remind the Fleet of the importance of the deck log as 
a historical document; one that preserves for future generations the actions 
and voices of our United States Sailors.

5. Congratulations to the winners!

6.  Released by the Honorable Mr. Erik K. Raven, Under Secretary of the 
Navy.//
