RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES THE REVISIONS TO SEA SHORE FLOW
(SSF) ENLISTED CAREER PATHS AS OUTLINED IN REF A AND REFLECTS THE INCREASINGLY 
SEA-CENTRIC NATURE OF NAVAL SERVICE.

2.  IN 2008, SEA SHORE FLOW WAS INTRODUCED AS A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE WAY 
THE NAVY DEFINED AND MANAGED ENLISTED SEA TOUR LENGTHS.
SSF ESTABLISHED CAREER PATHS FOR EACH ENLISTED COMMUNITY AND REPLACED THE 
PREVIOUS SEA SHORE ROTATION (SSR) TOUR LENGTHS POLICY, PER REF B, WHICH SET 
SEA TOUR LENGTHS BASED ON A SAILOR'S PAYGRADE.
SINCE 2008, THE NAVY HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF SEA DUTY BILLETS AND 
DECREASED THE NUMBER OF SHORE DUTY BILLETS.  AS A RESULT, IN ORDER TO IMPROVE 
MANNING LEVELS AT SEA:
  - 36 ENLISTED COMMUNITIES WILL HAVE LONGER SEA TOUR LENGTHS
  - 18 ENLISTED COMMUNITIES WILL REMAIN THE SAME OR BECOME SEA- INTENSIVE.

3.  THE SEA SHORE FLOW ENLISTED CAREER PATHS ANNOUNCED IN THIS MESSAGE APPLY 
TO ALL ACTIVE DUTY ENLISTED PERSONNEL AND SUPERSEDES THE SEA SHORE FLOW 
ENLISTED CAREER PATHS ANNOUNCED IN REFS A AND C.
HIGH YEAR TENURE (HYT) LIMITS REMAIN IN EFFECT.  CURRENT FULL-TIME SUPPORT 
(FTS) SEA/SHORE ROTATION POLICY REMAINS IN EFFECT.

4.  COMNAVPERSCOM MAY ADJUST PROJECTED ROTATION DATES (PRDS) BASED ON LENGTH 
OF TOUR REMAINING.  AS A GENERAL RULE, IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE TURBULENCE IN 
PERSONAL PLANNING, PRDS OF MARCH 2012 OR EARLIER WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED, UNLESS 
REQUESTED BY THE SAILOR (VIA
1306) OR HIS/HER COMMANDING OFFICER (BASED ON UNIT READINESS/ DEPLOYMENT 
NEEDS).  COMNAVPERSCOM IS AUTHORIZED TO ADJUST A PRD TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL SEA 
TOUR EXPERIENCE FOR SAILORS WHO ARE CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO A SEA TOUR.  THIS 
DECISION WILL BE MADE BASED ON OVERALL MANNING IN A RATING/COMMAND, PROJECTION 
OF FUTURE ROTATIONS TO FILL AT THE NEW PRD, AND ENHANCEMENT TO THE CAREER 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SAILOR.  COMMANDING OFFICERS CAN ALSO REQUEST THAT PRD 
ADJUSTMENTS BE MADE/NOT MADE BASED ON UNIT READINESS NEEDS AND IMPACT ON A 
SAILOR'S CAREER.
