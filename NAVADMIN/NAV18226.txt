RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN outlines the General Military Training (GMT) 
requirements for FY-19.  The number of mandatory topics for FY-19 has been 
reduced in order to empower commanders with a greater ability to decide what 
training their personnel should receive.  GMT is an opportunity for leaders 
to personally interact with their Sailors to share insight on the issues 
affecting warfighting readiness of our force.

2.  FY-19 GMT Requirements:
    a.  The following is the list of mandatory GMTs for
FY-19:
        (1) Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Awareness

            required)
        (2) Suicide Prevention
        (3) Cyber Awareness
        (4) Counterintelligence Awareness and Reporting
        (5) Antiterrorism Level 1 Awareness
    b.  Privacy Act training is now a biennial requirement and will be 
mandated in FY-20.
    c.  Consistent with reference (a), the following topics may be assigned 
for completion at commanding officers discretion:
        (1) Alcohol, Drugs, and Tobacco Awareness
        (2) Stress Management
        (3) Domestic Violence Prevention and Reporting
        (4) Sexual Health and Responsibility
        (5) Hazing Policy and Prevention

        (10) Combating Trafficking in Persons
        (11) Records Management
        (12) Electromagnetic Warfare
        (13) Operations Security

3.  Additional information
    a.  GMT webpage.  Detailed requirements for each topic are listed on the 
GMT webpage and should be reviewed in full by commands prior to assigning 
training.  The webpage provides topic-specific information such as:  
instructor and documentation requirements, training in combined military-
civilian sessions, and links to instructor guides and other training 
products.  To access the GMT webpage, go to My Navy Portal (MNP) at 
https://my.navy.mil.  Once logged in, select Professional Resources at the 
top of the page, then select General Military Training from the drop-down 
menu.
    b.  Navy Civilian Mandatory Training.  The official list of mandatory 
training for Navy civilians and supervisors of Navy civilians (both military 
and civilian) is maintained by the Department of the Navy, Office of Civilian 
Human Resources, at 
https://portal.secnav.navy.mil/orgs/MRA/DONHR/Training/Pages/Mandato
ry-Training.aspx.

gmt.distribution(at)navy.mil.  The point of contact for Navy civilian 
training is Ms. Nalo Washington, OPNAV N1C, (703)604-0324 or 
nalo.washington(at)navy.mil.
    d.  While not mandatory, some GMT topics such as ORM and Active Shooter 
are directed by other Navy authorities and are encouraged to be conducted as 
small group training, promoting leader/Sailor interaction in tailored groups 
at discretionary intervals throughout the year.

4.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or 30 September 
2019, whichever occurs first.
