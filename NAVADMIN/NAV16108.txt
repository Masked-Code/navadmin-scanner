SUBJ/ACADEMIC YEAR 2017 AND 2018 FLEET SCHOLARS EDUCATION PROGRAM//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the FY-17 academic year (AY) 17 and 18 Fleet 
Scholars Education Program (FSEP).  FSEP is a Navy talent management 
initiative that provides education opportunities to community-selected 
unrestricted line (URL) and information warfare community (IWC) officers.  
FSEP selectees will attend an accredited graduate school of their choice in 
residence (CONUS, Alaska and Hawaii) for up to 24 months.  FSEP selectees are 
authorized one funded degree.  If a second degree can be completed within 24 
months, FSEP selectees are authorized to complete the second degree at their 
own expense.  Distance learning, medical and legal education are not 
authorized under this program.

2.  Community sponsors will develop and implement selection criteria and 
policies to identify their most talented and proven performers for FSEP 
participation.  Community sponsors will make selections no later than 14 
October 2016 and submit to Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Manpower, 
Personnel, Training, and Education) in order to meet AY-17 and 18 fall/winter 
start dates.  FSEP is nominally focused on lieutenant (O-3) URL and IWC 
officers.  Each community sponsor may select up to their annual allocated 
graduate education opportunities shown below:

Community Designator                       Opportunities
AIRFOR    1310, 1320                          (7)
SURFOR    1110                                (7)
SUBFOR    1120                                (4)
NSWC      1130                                (3)
NECC      1140                                (3)
IWC       1810, 1820, 1830                    (6)

3.  Officers who have already received fully funded graduate education are 
not eligible to participate.  This does not include graduate degrees obtained 
through Post 9-11 G.I. Bill, tuition assistance or Navy College Program for 
Afloat College Education. Selectees will be assigned a unique additional 
qualification designation for purposes of tracking and career management.

4.  Upon notification of selection by the Navy, FSEP selectees shall notify 
Naval Post Graduate Civilian Institutions (NPS CIVINS) office at 
civins(at)nps.edu.  Participants will be reimbursed for up to three 
application and transcript fees.  Participants shall consult the list of 
schools that already have education service agreements (ESA) on the NPS 
CIVINS webpage.  In cases where the school of choice is not on the ESA 
listing, the selectee must notify the NPS CIVINS office at least six months 
prior to the anticipated start date to allow sufficient time to establish a 
new ESA with the university.  Participants are responsible for researching 
and completing prerequisites including graduate record examinations where 
applicable.  Starting enrollment and permanent change of station orders will 
be for the fall/winter term start of AY-17 and 18.

5.  FSEP selectees shall agree to remain on active duty for three years 
following graduation or withdrawal from the program.  A member who 
voluntarily or through misconduct fails to complete the active- duty time 
agreed upon shall be required to reimburse the cost of the education 
received, prorated for the obligated time served.

6.  Additional information regarding the FSEP program can be found on the 
Navy NPS CIVINS website at http://www.nps.edu/academics/civins/index.html.

7.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or 31 January 2017, 
whichever occurs first.
