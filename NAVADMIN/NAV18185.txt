RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the Fall FY-19 Full-Time 
Support (FTS) Officer Transfer and Redesignation Board on 30 October 2018.  
Applications from qualified active component (AC) and ready reserve officers 
will be considered by this board.  In line with reference (a), this board 
will also accept applications from FTS officers requesting redesignation into 
another FTS officer community.

2.  Complete application packages and waiver requests must be received no 
later than 20 September 2018.  No other correspondence will be accepted 
within 10 calendar days before the convening date of the board.

3.  Eligibility
    a.  All applicants must meet eligibility requirements outlined in 
reference (a) and the Fall FY-19 FTS eligibility criteria document:  
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/officer/communitymanagers/reserve/fts/Pages/FTSRedesignationBoard.aspx.  
Specific eligibility requirements are described for each designator and 
aviation community.  General eligibility criteria include projected rotation 
date (PRD), minimum service requirement (MSR), year group (YG) in and out 
quotas, and aviation bonus (AvB)/aviation career continuation pay (ACCP) 
contracts.
        (1) PRD.  Applicants, including reservists on mobilization or recall 
orders, must have a current PRD no later than 30 April 2020.
        (2) MSR.  Applicants currently under the MSR incurred upon 
commissioning must have an MSR end date prior to 30 October 2019.
        (3) AvB/ACCP.  Aviation officers with obligated service as a result 
of AvB/ACCP are eligible to apply if the officer will be within 12 months of 
completing AvB/ACCP obligation or department head tour at the time the board 
convenes.  Redesignation immediately following a department head tour may 
result in cancellation of AvB, which will be adjudicated by Aviation Officer 
Assignments (PERS-43).
        (4) Failure of Selection (FOS).  AC officers in a 2xFOS status for 
promotion to LCDR are eligible to apply for FTS regardless of MSR and 
AvB/ACCP contract term, a waiver request is not required.
        (5) YG.  The tentative YG considerations are indicated below.  These 
are subject to change due to AC out quotas.  The final approved YGs will be 
posted on the FTS officer community management (OCM) webpage along with the 
remainder of the application data in mid-August.

    c.  Reserve direct commission officers, limited duty officers and chief 
warrant officers (CWO) are eligible for the FTS program.
All officers applying to the FTS officer program shall possess a 4- year 
baccalaureate degree.  CWOs who are within 6 months of completing their 
baccalaureate degree may apply, but redesignation will not occur until after 
the degree is completed.
    d.  Unless in a 2xFOS status or a letter of resignation has been 
submitted, all AC applications will be routed by the FTS OCM through the 
applicable AC OCM for community release prior to applications being sent to 
the board.  Applicants who are not released by the AC OCM will not be 
eligible for the board.
    e.  Members who do not meet all eligibility requirements in line with 
reference (a) and the Fall FY-19 FTS eligibility criteria document posted on 
the FTS redesignation board website may submit a waiver request with their 
application.  Waiver requests shall include an endorsement from the current 
commanding officer of the applicant.  These endorsements are separate from 
any endorsements contained in the transfer/redesignation application of the 
member and shall specifically address the eligibility criteria requiring a 
waiver.  Waiver request procedures and constraints are described in the 
eligibility criteria document.  An example of a waiver request can be found 
on the FTS redesignation board website.

4.  AC officers will incur a minimum 2 year FTS obligation if selected.  As 
outlined in reference (b), aviators selected for the Fleet Logistics Support 
Squadron (VR) community will incur a 3 year FTS obligation.  All SELRES 
officers will incur a 3 year FTS obligation regardless of community.  All FTS 
obligations will begin on the date a member becomes a permanent gain at their 
first FTS command following satisfactory execution of permanent change of 
station orders or completion of platform-specific training, whichever happens 
later.

5.  Application requirements and procedures are provided on the FTS 
redesignation board website.

6.  Upon approval of the board proceedings, the results of the board will be 
posted on the FTS redesignation board website.  Applicants can expect to see

whichever occurs first.
