     E.  NAVY UNIFORM BOARD MEMBERSHIP UPDATE - UNIFORM BOARD

REPRESENTATION AND TO FACILITATE IMPROVED FLEET/UNIFORM BOARD FEEDBACK, 
COMMUNICATION AND AWARENESS.  UNIFORM BOARD MEMBERSHIP IS AS FOLLOWS:  
CHIEF OF NAVAL PERSONNEL (BOARD PRESIDENT); 
COMMANDER, NAVY EXPEDITIONARY COMBAT COMMAND; 
COMMANDER, NAVAL SUPPLY SYSTEMS COMMAND;

    F.  REF E ANNOUNCED THE PLANNED PHASED FLEET AVAILABILITY OF THE 
NWU.  THE ROLL-OUT OF THE NWU IS SCHEDULED ACCORDING TO NEXCOM 
DISTRIBUTION REGIONS WHICH DO NOT ALWAYS COINCIDE WITH CNIC REGIONS.  
THEREFORE, SOME REGIONS EXPERIENCE A DIFFERENT ROLL-OUT TIMELINE AMONG 
THEIR INDIVIDUAL BASES.  COMMANDER NAVAL REGION SOUTH EAST REQUESTED A 
REVISION TO THE EXISTING ROLLOUT PLAN TO FACILITATE GULF COAST BASES 
BECOMING MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH EASTERN FLORIDA BASES (CURRENTLY 1 
YEAR APART).  SINCE THERE IS NO EXCESS NWU INVENTORY TO ALLOW FOR A 
REGIONAL ACCELERATION, A REPRIORITIZATION OF REGIONS WAS CONSIDERED.  
THE APPROVED SOLUTION IS TO SWAP NAVAL DISTRICT WASHINGTON'S ROLLOUT 
DATE (OCTOBER 2009) WITH THE SE REGION'S GULF COAST COMMANDS (I.E. 
WESTERN FL, AL, MS, LA AND TX) CURRENTLY SCHEDULED APRIL 2010.  THE 
RESULTING REVISED NWU ROLLOUT SCHEDULE IS AS FOLLOWS:  GULF COAST 
COMMMANDS' ROLLOUT WILL COMMENCE OCTOBER 2009, VICE APRIL 2010, AND 
NAVAL DISTRICT WASHINGTON'S ROLLOUT WILL COMMENCE APRIL 2010, VICE 
OCTOBER 2009.  ALL OTHER NWU REGIONAL ROLLOUTS REMAIN AS ANNOUNCED IN 
REF E.  SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO THE REVISED NWU ROLLOUT PLAN WILL BE 
ANNOUNCED VIA NAVADMIN.
     G.  REF E GUIDANCE ON NWU OCCASION FOR WEAR POLICY DOES NOT 
SUPERSEDE REF B REGARDING WEAR OF CUU.  SPECIFICALLY, REF B CHAPTER 6, 
SECTION 8 PROVIDES CNO APPROVED LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS ALLOWED TO WEAR 
THE CUU AS THEIR DAILY WORKING UNIFORM.
2.   THESE UNIFORM POLICY CHANGES ARE A DIRECT RESULT OF FLEET FEEDBACK.
