4.  Selections are conditional upon the selectee remaining fully eligible in
all respects, meeting physical qualifications for commissioning as
determined by the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED), and assignment by
Naval Service Training Command (NSTC) to an approved Naval Reserve Officers
Training Corps (NROTC) affiliated university based upon an official degree
plan and acceptance letter from the university.  Upon completion of an NSTC
approved baccalaureate degree program, selectees will receive appointments
as Ensigns, USN.

5.  Commanding officers should take the following actions:  Notify selectees
and alternates of their selection and ensure they receive a copy of this
message.  Also, notify NSTC N92 Selection and Placement (N92/STA-21) via
e-mail at GRLK_STA21(at)navy.mil no later than 2 December 2022 of any
selectee or alternate who does not desire to participate in the program.
Immediately report to NSTC (N92/STA-21) all conditions or circumstances that 
may disqualify a selectee or alternate from participating in the STA-21 
program via e-mail at GRLK_STA21(at)navy.mil.

6.  Selectees and alternates should take the following actions:
Complete a physical examination for a training program leading to a
commission in the unrestricted line, nurse corps, or civil engineering
corps, as applicable, in line with references (a) and (b) at a military 
treatment facility.  Note that many commissioning standards exceed the 
enlisted standards required to remain on active duty.
Ensure copies of completed physicals, Report of Medical History (DD2807-1),
and Report of Medical Examination (DD2808), including Human Immunodeficiency
Virus results from a test taken after 1 January 2022, are submitted no later
than 1 December 2022 to: 

    Commander
    Naval Service Training Command
    Attn:  N92/STA-21
    320A DEWEY AVENUE BLDG 3
    Great Lakes, IL 60088-2845
    or via DoD SAFE (https//safe.apps.mil). 

Aviation option selectees/alternates must have flight physicals uploaded
directly into Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office by a flight surgeon,
and submitted to Naval Aerospace Medical Institute.
The selectees/alternates must be certified as qualified or have a waiver
recommended by Naval Medicine Operation Training Center.  All required
physical forms can be downloaded from the STA-21 homepage at
https://www.netc.navy.mil/Commands/Naval-Service-Training-
Command/STA21/.  Commands should not forward physical forms directly to
BUMED.  Send acceptance letters from no more than three NROTC host or NROTC
cross-town affiliated universities to the NSTC address listed above or via
DoD SAFE. Application to more than one university is advisable.  Selectees
will begin the STA-21 program with attendance at the Naval Science Institute
(NSI) in 1 of 2 classes starting on approximately 13 February 2023 or 3
April 2023 for a 6 week period.  Send an official degree plan from an NROTC
host or NROTC cross-town affiliated university where they have been
accepted.  Degree plans must cover the time actually attending college.
Degree plans of selectees should begin with the summer term 2023.  All
STA-21 selectees will be required to attend the NSI en-route to their
assigned university.  Alternates:  Each alternate must complete the same
actions outlined in paragraph 6 of this message.  If a primary selectee
declines participation in the program, is determined to be not physically
qualified, or otherwise becomes ineligible for continuation in the program
prior to executing orders, a qualified alternate will be selected.  This
notification often comes at the last minute, therefore, alternates who
desire participation in the STA-21 program need to be complete with the
actions listed above when notified.

7.  The deadline for required degree plans and college admission
documentation is 1 December 2022.  It is in the best interest of each
selectee and alternate to submit verification of eligibility criteria as
soon as possible to expedite university assignment and release of permanent
change of station orders.  Selectees will not be ordered to NSI en-route to
their assigned NROTC University until all conditions outlined in paragraph 6
have been met.

8.  The preferred method of delivery of all documents is through DoD SAFE
utilizing email GRLK_STA21(at)navy.mil (ensure an email with the encrypted
passphrase is also sent to GRLK_STA21(at)navy.mil).
Documents can also be mailed to the address above.

9.  Points of contact are:
    a.  Ms. Rebecca Ludowise, rebecca.a.ludowise.civ(at)us.navy.mil.
    b.  Mr. Jim Branch, james.r.branch8.civ(at)us.navy.mil.
    c.  Mr. David Burmeister, david.a.burmeister.civ(at)us.navy.mil.

10.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled,
whichever occurs first.
