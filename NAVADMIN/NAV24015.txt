accepted the promotion on the date indicated.  An officer who chooses to 
decline promotion must submit the declination in writing to COMNAVPERSCOM

3.  The Commanding Officer (CO), the Secretary of the Navy, or his designee, 
has the authority to delay projected promotions.  Upon the exercise of a 
delay, the officer shall be notified in writing before the effective date of 
the promotion and not be tendered the promoting appointment.  The delay 
authority will immediately forward the notification of delay with supporting 
documentation to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-83), copy to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806).

4.  COs are reminded of their responsibility to ensure the officers they are 
promoting are mentally, physically, morally, and professionally qualified in 
accordance with section 14311 of title 10, U.S. Code.   Per reference (a), 
officers are ineligible for promotion if they have failed the most recent 
Physical Fitness Assessment.  COs shall verify the promoting officer's 
information in the Physical Readiness Information Management System to ensure 
compliance with reference (a), as modified by reference (b), and delay the 
officers promotion in accordance with paragraph 3 of this NAVADMIN, if 
required.

5.  Prepare a Delivery of Permanent Appointment (NAVPERS form

TAR LCDR voluntary retirements changed with National Defense Authorization 
Act 2021; Update to reference (c) is pending.)  TAR officers and those 
officers temporarily on active duty anticipating release from active duty 
under reference (e) may accept promotion without incurring any additional 
active-duty obligation.

7.  New photographs are required for all officers within three months after 
acceptance of promotion.  See reference (f) for specific requirements.
