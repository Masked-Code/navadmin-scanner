SUBJ/SERVICE MEMBERS' GROUP LIFE INSURANCE AND FAMILY SERVICE
MEMBERS' GROUP LIFE INSURANCE PREMIUM CHANGES EFFECTIVE 1 JULY 2006//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS HAS ANNOUNCED
A CHANGE TO SERVICE MEMBERS' GROUP LIFE INSURANCE (SGLI) AND FAMILY
SGLI (FSGLI) RATES THAT IS EFFECTIVE 1 JULY 2006.
2. SGLI PREMIUM RATES PER $1,000 OF COVERAGE WILL INCREASE 7 CENTS
PER MONTH. FOR EXAMPLE, SAILORS COVERED FOR THE MAXIMUM $400,000
WILL SEE THEIR MONTHLY PREMIUM INCREASE FROM $27 TO $29. INCLUDED AS
PART OF THE $29 PREMIUM IS A MANDATORY $1 PER MONTH CHARGE FOR
TRAUMATIC INJURY PROTECTION UNDER SGLI (TSGLI).
A. SAILORS WHO ELECTED LESS THAN FULL COVERAGE WILL NOT HAVE TO
SUBMIT A SGLV FORM 8286A TO MAINTAIN THEIR PRESENT COVERAGE. FOR
EXAMPLE, A SAILOR WHO ELECTED $200,000 VICE $400,000 COVERAGE, WILL
PAY $15, WHICH INCLUDES THE MANDATORY $1 PER MONTH CHARGE FOR TSGLI. 
RESERVE MEMBERS DRILLING FOR POINTS AND IN A NON-PAY STATUS CURRENTLY
COVERED UNDER SGLI WILL BE BILLED FOR THE HIGHER PREMIUM BEGINNING 1
JULY 2006.
B. SGLI PREMIUMS ARE INCREASING BECAUSE THE CURRENT SGLI PREMIUM
RATE IS BELOW THE "BREAK-EVEN" POINT AND THEREFORE IS INSUFFICIENT TO
COVER THE COST OF PEACETIME CLAIMS (NOTE: THE COST OF WARTIME SGLI
CLAIMS IS BORNE BY THE UNIFORMED SERVICES, NOT BY SERVICE MEMBERS).
3. FSGLI PREMIUM RATES FOR ALL AGE BRACKETS WILL SEE A REDUCTION
BEGINNING 1 JULY 2006, BECAUSE OF "FAVORABLE CLAIMS EXPERIENCE."
4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SGLI AND FSGLI RATE CHANGES AND
ANSWERS TO FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ARE AVAILABLE AT
WWW.INSURANCE.VA.GOV.
