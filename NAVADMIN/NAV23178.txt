RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Aviation Command 
Retention Bonuses (ACRB) for the Active Component (AC) in line with 
references (a) and (b).  The FY-23 Aviation Department Head Bonus (ADHRB) was 
addressed in NAVADMIN 089/23.

2.  A vital part of developing a total force strategy and maintaining combat 
readiness is to provide appropriate incentives to retain skilled personnel 
for critical Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) billets.  The AC ACRB program 
incentivizes highly talented, hard-working naval aviators and naval flight 
officers, screened for aviation command to choose to remain on Active Duty.  
Our return on investment is the retention for continued Navy service of our 
aviation warfighters, with their invaluable and irreplaceable skillsets and 
leadership.

3.  AC ACRB:
    a.  The FY-23 AC ACRB is designed to retain those officers with the 
capabilities and command experience in our primary warfighting missions that 
are critical for the future of our service.  Our cadre of commander (CDR) 
commanding officers (CO) lead our NAE today, and they are the major 
commanders and flag officers of tomorrow.  Their skills and leadership 
experience are essential to the success of the Navy.  The FY-23 AC ACRB 
incentivizes their continued service in follow-on assignments requiring 
senior aviation leaders.
    b.  The FY-23 AC ACRB applicants must have screened during the Aviation 
Command Screen Board (ACSB) as CO of an eligible operational, operational 
training, or special mission CDR command in order to apply.  Eligible 
commands are those for which the annual AC ACSB selects officers to serve as 
CO, excluding second in grade, sequential, bonus, and fleet replacement 
squadron commands.  Consult the FY-23 AC ACRB program information for 
specific eligibility criteria and limitations.  The application opportunity 
commences with the release of this NAVADMIN and closes on 31 August 2023.
    c.  All FY-23 AC ACRB contracts will be worth from $35,000 to $105,000.  
Participation in the FY-23 AC ACRB obligates contractees from 2 to 3 years of 
obligated service to include full completion of a post-command commander 
(PCC) tour, which may be between 24 and 36 months depending on assignment.  
The minimum ACRB obligation ends after 21 years of commissioned service, the 
projected rotation date of the assigned PCC tour, or 2 years from the 
contract acceptance date, whichever is later and depending on contract 
length.  The FY-23 AC ACRB applications for those currently under ADHRB 
obligations will be accepted, held in abeyance, and activated upon ADHRB 
contract expiration.
    d.  The FY-23 AC ACRB rates and obligated service are as follows:
         (1) 2 year option - $35k total ($17.5k/year); obligation ending at 
21 years of cumulative service (YCS).
         (2) 3 year option - $105k total ($35k/year); obligation ending at 22 
YCS.

4.  Additional Aviation Bonus (AvB) Information:
    a.  Officers accepting AvB contracts are not precluded from participating 
in the Career Intermission Program (CIP).  Officers interested in both AvB 
and CIP should contact the AvB program manager and their detailer for more
