SUBJ/ALASKA SEA SERVICES SCHOLARSHIP FOR ACADEMIC YEAR 2014-2015//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the requirements and solicits applications 
for the Alaska Sea Services Scholarship Program.  The Alaska Sea Services 
Scholarship annually awards up to six $1,000 scholarships for undergraduate 
education to dependent children and spouses of Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast 
Guard personnel who legally claim Alaska as their state of residence.  
Applications will be accepted from 1 November 2013 through 1 March 2014 for 
the FY-14 selection board, which convenes in April 2014.
2.  Background.  Citizens of Alaska raised funds for a $10,000 war bond as a 
gift to the USS JUNEAU (CL 52) during World War II.  After the sinking of the 
USS JUNEAU (CL 52), this gift was to have been presented to the USS ALASKA 
(CB 1), but the USS ALASKA (CB 1) was decommissioned before the presentation.  
Consequently, the governor of the territory of Alaska and the Secretary of 
the Navy agreed that the bond would be left on deposit in the First National 
Bank of Juneau until the USS ALASKA (CB 1) was recommissioned or another 
appropriate application could be found.  In 1986, the Navy  established the 
Alaska Sea Services Scholarship fund.
3.  Requirements.  To be considered for the Alaska Sea Services Scholarship, 
an applicant must be the dependent (child or spouse) of a legal resident of 
the state of Alaska who is, or was at the time of death/designation as 
missing-in-action, a regular or reserve U.S.
Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard member on active-duty, inactive duty, or 
retired with or without pay.  Selected candidates will be those who rate 
highest in five key areas below:
    a.  Academic proficiency;
    b.  Character;
    c.  Leadership ability;
    d.  Community involvement; and
    e.  Financial need
4.  Selection.  A selection board will be held by the Navy League Foundation.  
The selected nominee packages will then be submitted to Naval Education and 
Training Command for final approval, after which selectees will be notified 
and scholarship funds will be disbursed to the appropriate academic 
institution.
5.  Applicant procedures.  Up to six $1,000 scholarships are awarded annually 
to applicants who meet the specified criteria.  Applicants must also show 
acceptance at an accredited college or university for full-time undergraduate 
study for a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree.  No more than two 
scholarship awards may be given to any individual during pursuit of the four-
year degree.  To apply on line, visit the Navy League web site at 
www.navyleague.org.
