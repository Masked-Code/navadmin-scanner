CAPTAINS.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the FY-18 Full Time Support 
(FTS) Captain Selective Retention (SELRET) Board.

2.  This SELRET Board is designed to bring FTS inventory in line with 
authorized end strength, allow for reasonable promotion opportunity, and 
permit sufficient junior officer accessions to meet FTS officer operational 
requirements.  FTS officers subject to involuntary release from active duty 
as a result of these boards will be retained on active duty, if necessary, to 
obtain eligibility for retirement with pay at 20 years active service.

3.  The FTS Captain SELRET Board will convene on 23 October 2017 to consider 
FTS captains in all competitive categories for retention. Historically, this 
board is held in September of every year. Selection board computer technology 
refresh necessitated shifting the board convening date to October 2017.  This 
shift in convening date will have no effect on policies or required 
separation dates. This board will consider in the first gate those FTS 
captains who were promoted during FY-16, and in the second gate those FTS 
captains who were promoted during FY-13.  In line with reference (a), second 
gate FTS captains not selected for retention will retire or be released from 
active duty no later than 1 September 2018.  In line with reference (b), 
first gate FTS captains not selected for retention will retire or be released 
from active duty no later than 1 September 2019.  In either case, FTS 
officers will be retained on active duty, if necessary, to enable the officer 
to become eligible for retirement with pay.

4.  Amplifying information will be posted on the reserve personnel management 
and FTS community manager websites.  The authorized number of selections for 
retention will be posted as part of the board convening order on the board 
convening date.  The FTS officer community manager web page is:

at (901) 874-4346/DSN 882 or via e-mail at tom.willard(at)navy.mil.
