RMKS/1.  THE MARJORIE STERRETT BATTLESHIP FUND AWARD WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1917 
BY THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE ASSOCIATION.  THE FUND WAS INITIATED BY A LETTER FROM 
13 YEAR OLD MARJORIE STERRETT IN FEBRUARY 1916.  MARJORIE CONTRIBUTED HER 
WEEKLY ALLOWANCE OF A DIME TO "HELP BUILD A BATTLESHIP FOR UNCLE SAM." PRIOR 
TO WORLD WAR II, INCOME FROM THIS FUND WAS USED TO PAY PRIZES ANNUALLY TO 
TURRET AND GUN CREWS MAKING THE HIGHEST SCORES IN SHORT-RANGE BATTLE 
PRACTICE, AND SUBMARINE CREWS MAKING THE HIGHEST SCORES IN TORPEDO FIRING.  
IT IS NOW USED TO RECOGNIZE THOSE SHIPS WHICH DISPLAY BATTLE EFFICIENCY AND 
EMPHASIZE READINESS AND FITNESS OF THE SHIP.
