RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the solicitation of applications from highly 
qualified and motivated E6 through E9 Reserve Sailors for the Fiscal Year 
(FY) 2026 Navy Selected Reserve Limited Duty Officer (LDO) and Chief Warrant 
Officer (CWO) programs.  Where conflicts with reference (a) exist, this 
NAVADMIN and reference (b) take precedence.  The FY26 Navy Selected Reserve 
LDO and CWO In-Service Procurement Board (ISPB) number is 26315. 
 
2.  The FY26 Navy Selected Reserve LDO and CWO ISPB will consider candidates 
for the following officer designators: 623X, 626X, 628X, 629X, 633X, 641X, 
649X, 653X, 711X, 712X, 713X, 715X, 717X, 718X, 781X, 782X and 
783X.  Eligible Sailors are encouraged to apply for the designators for which 
they are most qualified, regardless of current rating.  Refer to references 
(a) through (c) for eligibility criteria.  NOTE:  Current Reserve CWOs that 
desire to transition into the LDO community are no longer supported and will 
not be considered if an application is received.  No further exceptions 
will be considered. 
 
3.  FY26 guidance. 
   a.  All applicants for the LDO and CWO programs must have a security 
clearance prior to commissioning and must be worldwide assignable. 
   b.  Time-in-service (TIS) for the FY26 Navy Selected Reserve LDO and CWO 
ISPB must be computed to 1 October 2025.  In line with references (a) and 
(b), TIS is synonymous with years of qualifying service toward a non-regular 
(Reserve) retirement. 
   c.  TIS requirements are: 
       (1) LDO.  Eight to 14 years for LDO applicants.  All LDO applicants 
must be able to serve at least 6 years of qualifying service and complete 20 
years of qualifying service prior to age 62. 
TIS waivers for less than 8 years for LDO will not be considered. 
TIS waivers for more than 20 years for LDO will not be considered. 
No further exceptions will be considered. 
       (2) CWO. Fourteen to 20 years for CWO applicants.  All CWO applicants 
must be able to complete 20 years of qualifying service prior to reaching 62 
years of age.  TIS waivers for less than 10 years for CWO will not be 
considered.  TIS waivers for more than 25 years for CWO will not be 
considered.  No further exceptions will be considered. 
       (3) Applicants must also not reach or exceed high year tenure for 
their present pay grade within the calendar year the application is 
submitted. 
       (4) All requests for TIS waivers shall be submitted to the RC 
LDO/CWO OCM and PERS-92 contacts listed below and must be received by  
1 September 2024.  TIS waiver requests and Navy Selected Reserve LDO and CWO 
applications are two separate processes with their own respective deadlines.   
Failure to follow this guidance and the timelines provided will result in a 
subsequent no consideration of the requested TIS waiver.  The TIS Waiver 
Template is available at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
Management/Community-Management/Officer/Reserve-OCM/Selected-Reservists/RC-
LDO-CWO/. 
       (5) The TIS waiver approval letter must also be submitted as 
an enclosure to the application. 
   d.  All applicants applying to the 715X designator must hold NEC O26A or 
O23A.  All applicants applying to the 717X designator must hold NEC O52A. 
   e.  E6 evaluations due 15 November 2024 will be submitted as an addendum 
in the guidelines of this NAVADMIN. 
   f.  Due to ongoing rating mergers and realignments, eligible Sailors are 
encouraged to apply for the designator for which they have extensive 
documented technical expertise and leadership experience in their enlisted 
service records, regardless of the current rating.  However, special 
attention should be given to the guidance in Chapter 7, subparagraph 9c of 
reference (a) and to the designator discrete requirements. 
   g.  In line with reference (b), all LDO applicants must include a 
statement in the additional comments section (paragraph 2) of the 
application, agreeing to further service, as follows:  "I, [name], if 
selected for permanent appointment under the Navy Reserve LDO program, agree 
to accept such appointment and further agree to remain in the Ready Reserve 
for a period of 3 years after I accept such appointment." 
   h.  In line with reference (b), all CWO applicants must include a 
statement in the additional comments section (paragraph 2) of the 
application, agreeing to further service, as follows:  "I, [name], if 
selected for permanent appointment under the Navy Reserve CWO program, agree 
to accept such appointment and further agree to remain in the Ready Reserve 
for a period of 6 years after I accept such appointment." 
   i.  Commanding Officer/Officer-in-Charge (CO/OIC) endorsement must contain 
the following statement: "Applicant meets all requirements outlined in 
OPNAVINST 1420.1B, OPNAVINST 1120.12A, NAVADMIN XXX/24 (use the NAVADMIN # 
for this message), and the physical fitness standards of OPNAVINST 
6110.1J."  The endorsement should also clearly state the command and 
CO's/OIC's name and rank. 
 
4. Amplifying guidance and direction to COs and officers in charge for 
appraisal boards and interview panel member selection. 
   a.  Interview appraisal boards shall be constructed of only three Reserve 
(preferred) or Active Component officers.  The names of the approved 
appraisal board members must be included in the CO/OIC endorsement.  To the 
maximum extent possible, LDOs or CWOs shall be utilized as board members. 
   b.  Every effort (including teleconference media) should be made to ensure 
the board members are from the LDO or CWO designator's competitive category 
for which the applicant is applying.  The senior member of the interview 
panel for LDO applicants must be a lieutenant commander or above.  The senior 
member of the interview panel for CWO applicants must be a CWO4 or above. 
   c.  Minimum grade requirements for board members are lieutenant or 
CWO3.  CWO3 panel members must have at least 2 years time in grade.  The 
interviewing board should, whenever possible, be comprised of officers who 
are not in the applicant's command, or at minimum, not directly in the chain 
of command. 
   d.  If it is not possible to assemble a panel of three officers, the 
interviews may be conducted separately.  Only three interview appraisals are 
required for each applicant. 
   e.  Interview appraisal board member preparation for applicant appraisal 
boards is an important part of the board process.  Review of the application, 
review of discrete requirements for the applicant designator, having well 
thought out questions on technical expertise, leadership, and knowledge of 
the designator for which the candidate is applying, to include future career 
path if selected, are all great examples of board member preparation. 
   f.  Each appraisal must contain the names of all three-panel members. The 
interviewer appraisal sheet is located at 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Boards/Administrative/LDO-
CWO/ 
   g.  The technical ability and potential blocks on the interview appraisal 
sheet must be marked for LDO and CWO candidates. 
   h.  The CO of either SEAL Team 17 or 18 are required to endorse applicants 
for both the 715X and 717X designators. 
 
5.  Applicants currently serving on mobilization orders may have their 
application endorsed by their field commander.  All applications endorsed by 
field commanders must have concurrence of their parent command.  A sample 
addendum letter is located at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-
Management/Boards/Administrative/LDO-CWO/. 
 
6.  Applicants must maintain eligibility throughout the selection and 
commissioning process.  Applicants that are deemed ineligible after the 
submission of applications must be declared ineligible by their current CO, 
field commander (if on a mobilization) or parent command CO.  A sample 
removal of recommendation format is located at 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Boards/Administrative/LDO-
CWO/. 
 
7.  Application Submission.  Applications must be received by MNCC no later 
than 1 October 2024.

originate from the applicant via their CO.  However, it is acceptable for the 
command to submit an applicant's package on his or her behalf, provided that 
the package has been endorsed by the CO and the applicant has been provided a 
copy of their entire package prior to submission.  Information received that 
is not under the cover letter of the applicant (e.g., third-party 
correspondence) and endorsed by the command, or not received by the MyNavy 
Career Center (MNCC) by the established deadline(s) will not be presented to 
the board.  Note: Although a late submission may be accepted by MNCC, it will 
not be presented to the board. 
   b.All applications must include a command-endorsed NAVPERS 1120/1, Reserve
