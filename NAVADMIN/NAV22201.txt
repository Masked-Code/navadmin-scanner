RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces general military training (GMT) 
requirements for fiscal year (FY) 2023. 
 
2.  FY-23 Mandatory GMT: 
    a.  These requirements must be completed by all military personnel during 
the FY.  Civilian supervisors of military personnel are encouraged to 
complete these GMT topics, as applicable. 
    b.  The following are mandatory GMT topics in FY-23: 
        (1) Equal Opportunity, Harassment, and Resolution Options. 
        (2) Domestic Abuse. 
        (3) Operations Security (OPSEC) and Controlled Unclassified 
Information (CUI) (refer to paragraph 2.c). 
        (4) Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Awareness. 
        (5) Cyber Awareness Challenge. 
        (6) Counterintelligence Awareness and Reporting. 
        (7) Suicide Prevention. 
    c.  Commands may combine OPSEC and CUI into one training session.  The 
training should be tailored to meet the specific needs of that unit. 
        (1) Commands have the option to complete CUI training via 
alternate means as long as they meet the minimum training requirements of 
reference (b), section 2.10.g. 
        (2) When feasible, OPSEC training should be conducted in person or 
through approved video conferencing technology.  At a minimum, personnel must 
be aware of their units tailored critical information and indicators list in 
line with reference (c). 
    d.  Commands may elect to complete cyber awareness challenge training 
using instructor-led or computer-based methods.  Additional guidance will be 
provided in the FY-23 Cybersecurity Awareness Challenge NAVADMIN. 
    e.  The recommended method of delivery for SAPR and Suicide Prevention 
annual training is via face-to-face, small group facilitated discussions.  If 
in-person, face-to-face delivery is not feasible, facilitated small group 
training using approved video conferencing technology is considered face-to-
face, fully meeting training requirements.  SAPR and Suicide Prevention 
training is not authorized for delivery via non-Department of Defense (DoD) 
approved collaborative technology (e.g., Facebook, Zoom, etc.).  Senior 
commanders have the authority to issue more restrictive guidance to their 
subordinate commands. 
    f.  Suicide Prevention annual training should include a continuum of 
messaging, education, and awareness throughout the year.  Commands should 
leverage the guidance provided by the Suicide Prevention Month and SAPR 
Prevention Month Tool Kits, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a 
continuous dialogue on prevention. Commands who participate in the year-long 
Commander, Pacific Fleet and U.S. Fleet Forces Command Suicide Prevention 
Continuum, detailed in reference (d), will meet the annual GMT 
requirement.  The FY-23 update to the Suicide Prevention Continuum will be 
available no later than 1 October 2022 at https://flankspeed.sharepoint-/  
mil.us/sites/CPF-HQ-N1/SuicidePrevention. 
 
3.  FY-23 Command Discretion GMT: 
    a.  Command discretion GMT is not required at any specified 
periodicity but may have situational requirements (i.e., initial 
entry, pre-deployment, career milestones, etc.).  Commanding 
officers (CO) should train their personnel at a time and place that 
best meets their command and mission needs. 
    b.  COs may assign the following topics at their discretion: 
        (1) Influence Awareness - Countering Disinformation. 
        (2) Anti-terrorism Level 1. 
        (3) Privacy Act. 
        (4) Navy Energy. 
        (5) Center for Development of Security Excellence Insider 
Threat Course. 
        (6) Combating Trafficking in Persons. 
        (7) Operational Risk Management. 
        (8) Personal Financial Management. 
        (9) Sexual Health and Responsibility. 
        (10) Traumatic Brain Injury. 
        (11) Records Management. 
    c.  Tactical Combat Casualty Care - Tier 1 is no longer listed 
as a GMT.  Deploying units should refer to applicable Type Commander 
guidance in line with reference (e). 
    d.  Personal Financial Management training does not have a 
required annual periodicity but is instead mandatory at personal and 
professional touchpoints across the military lifecycle in line with 
reference (a). 
    e.  Financial Readiness touchpoint courses are available via 
Navy e-Learning (search for the title *touchpoint* under the Course 
Catalog tab) and the MyNavy Financial Literacy mobile app.  If 
preferred, in-person training can be provided by a Fleet and Family 
Support Center Personal Financial Manager, a Command Financial 
Specialist, or a Navy Reserve Center-assigned Personal Financial 
Counselor.  In-person training information and resources can be 
found at https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Support-Services/21st-Century-
Sailor/Family-Readiness/Personal-Financial-Mgmt/ and 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/general-skills-training/gmt/. 
    f.  Records management training should be completed by 
administrative personnel who manage and maintain records on a 
routine basis. 
 
4.  Additional Information: 
    a.  Detailed requirements for each topic are listed on the GMT 
webpage and should be reviewed thoroughly by commands prior to 
assigning training.  The webpage provides topic-specific information 
such as: 
        (1) Instructor and documentation requirements. 
        (2) Training in combined military-civilian sessions. 
        (3) Links to instructor guides and other training products. 
    b.  The GMT webpage can be found on the MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/general-skills-training/gmt/. 
    c.  Current SAPR and Suicide Prevention training materials are 
not designed for individual self-study.  Training using methods 
other than facilitated small group sessions will be challenging.
