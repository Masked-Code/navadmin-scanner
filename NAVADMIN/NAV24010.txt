RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance for the administration of the March 
2024 (Cycle 263) Navy-Wide Advancement Exam (NWAE) for Active-Duty and 
Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) Sailors.

2.  In line with references (a) and (b), the Enlisted Advancement Worksheet 
(EAW) is the authoritative source of data used to determine Cycle 263 E-5 and 
E-6 eligibility.  Commands are to accurately validate, complete, and finalize 
all EAWs in the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS).  EAW 
discrepancies may be addressed via the Post-exam Administration Comment (PAC) 
process after worksheets are locked for the cycle.

3.  Cycle 263 timeline:
    a.  31 January 2024:  Professional Military Knowledge - Eligibility Exam 
(PMK-EE) completion.  In line with reference (c), PMK-EE remains mandatory 
once per paygrade for all E-5 and E-6 candidates to be eligible for NWAE 
cycle participation.  Refer to reference (d) regarding special exceptions for 
new accessions.
    b.  7 March 2024:  E-6 exam administration.  EAW will close one week 
after the exam date on the worksheet.
    c.  14 March 2024:  E-5 exam administration.  EAW will close one week 
after the exam date on the worksheet.
    d.  Deviation from administration dates.  In line with reference (a), 
commands that require rescheduling of NWAE administration date (with valid 
reason) may request a deviation of NWAE administration from Navy Personnel 
Command (PERS-803).  If authorized, NWAE administration will be completed by 
31 March 2024.

4.  Eligibility requirements are found in chapter 2 of reference (a).  The 
following information is specific to Cycle 263:
    a.  Terminal eligibility date (TED):  1 July 2024.
    b.  Minimum Time-In-Rate (TIR) on or before:
        E-6 - 1 July 2021
        E-5 - 1 July 2023
    c.  E-6 candidate TIR requirements for early promote (EP) can be waived 
by one year with Commanding Officer (CO) or Officer-In-Charge
(OIC) approval.  EAW must be created manually for all who receive that 
waiver.  EP candidates are still bound by the same PMK-EE deadline as regular 
TIR candidates.
    d.  High-year tenure (HYT) date: In line with references (e) and (f),  
the HYT Plus Pilot program allows Sailors to continue their Navy careers 
beyond HYT limits.  References (e) and (f) should be read in their entirety.  
In the EAW, the "HYT Exceeded" entry may reflect "Yes" - when applicable, 
select "Yes" for "HYT Waived".
    e.  Security/Interim security clearance (if required):  Refer to chapter 
2 of reference (a).  All E-5 and E-6 NWAE candidates must have applicable 
adjudication (Top Secret or Secret) or CO/OIC Interim clearance dated prior 
to 1 March 2024.  If clearance is revoked, an exam is not authorized until 
the discrepancy is corrected.
    f.  Performance Mark Average (PMA).  Compute PMA for E-5 candidates and 
Reporting Senior's Cumulative Average (RSCA) PMA for
E-6 candidates in line with references (a) and (g).  Use all applicable 
evaluations in current paygrade with an ending date that falls within the 
following periods:
        E-6 - 1 March 2021 to 29 February 2024
        E-5 - 1 December 2022 to 29 February 2024
