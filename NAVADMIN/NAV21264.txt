RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the following major policy changes for the 
Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA). 
    a.  Command Fitness Leaders (CFL) will not enter PFA data into Physical 
Readiness Information Management System Two (PRIMS-2) for the Calendar Year 
(CY) 2021 PFA cycle. 
    b.  CY 2022 PFA requirements will consist of a single cycle conducted 
from 1 April to 30 September 2022. 
 
2.  CY 2021 PFA Cycle.  The previous contractor has not delivered PRIMS-2 as 
scheduled.  As a result, the Navy will continue to execute the CY 2021 PFA 
cycle as planned with the following modifications. 
    a.  CFLs will not enter CY 2021 PFA cycle data into PRIMS-2. 
CFLs will continue to record official CY 2021 PFA scores on the official Body 
Composition Assessment (BCA) and Physical Readiness Test (PRT) score sheets, 
to include Physical Activity Risk Factor Questionnaire (PARFQ) and medical 
clearance/waivers, in line with references (a) through (f). 
    b.  Commands will maintain official PFA score sheets and document PFA 
performance on fitness reports/evaluations (FITREP/EVALS). 
    c.  CFLs must manually track and monitor Sailors assigned to the Fitness 
Enhancement Program (FEP) in line with reference (g). Sailors will remain on 
FEP until passing an unofficial (mock) or official PFA. 
    d.  Reference (h) has been updated to include: 
        (1)  How to manually calculate the overall PRT score without planks 
in the equation.  The overall PRT score for CY 2021 will only include push-up 
and cardio/alternate-cardio modalities.  Forearm planks will be entered on 
the official PRT score sheet for record purposes only. 
        (2)  The use of the PFA calculator within the Official Navy PFA App 
to determine stationary bike PRT scores. 
 
3.  CY 2022 PFA Cycle.  Recognizing the foreseeable conditions to include 
continued pandemic, PRIMS-2 rollout and modality validation, there will be a 
single PFA cycle for CY 2022. 
    a.  The cycle will be conducted from 1 April to 30 September 2022. 
    b.  All medically cleared Sailors must participate in the CY 2022 PFA 
cycle.  To meet Department of Defense annual requirements for PFA, there will 
not be an excellent or above performance exception for the CY 2022 cycle 
based upon CY 2021 PFA performance. Commanders may use appropriate incentives 
at the local level to reward performance. 
    c.  Medically cleared Sailors will participate in all three fitness 
modalities (push-ups, forearm plank, cardio or alternate cardio) to determine 
their CY 2022 PFA cycle overall score. 
 
4.  The Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Manpower, Personnel, Training and 
Education) (OPNAV N1) will promulgate a data call to Echelon 2 Commanders to 
submit a sample of CY 2021 PFA cycle plank scores via a Department of the 
Navy Tasking, Records and Consolidated Knowledge Repository (DONTRACKER) 
tasker.  The plank data collected will be used to validate the plank scoring 
tables. Commands selected will be required to submit command PFA plank 
scores for this data call. 
 
5.  Contact the Physical Readiness Program Office for additional information: 
    a.  For policy related questions via e-mail at PRP(at)navy.mil. 
    b.  For PRIMS related questions via e-mail at PRIMS(at)navy.mil. 
    c.  For policy or PRIMS related questions via phone at (901) 874-2210/ 
DSN 882. 
6.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
