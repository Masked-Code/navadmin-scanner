SUBJ/NOTICE OF CONVENING FY-24-2 TEST PILOT SCHOOL SELECTION BOARD// 
 
REF/A/DOC/BUPERS/06JAN21// 
AMPN/REF A IS BUPERSINST 1500.62E, TEST PILOT SCHOOLS.// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the convening of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot 
School (USNTPS) Selection Board on 22 June 2023.  This board will select 
highly qualified naval aviators and naval flight officers (NFO) for USNTPS 
and cole du Personnel Navigant d'Essais et de Reception (EPNER), French Test 
Pilot School.  Test Pilot School (TPS) graduates have a significant and long-
lasting influence on platforms and systems that directly impact the future 
warfighting capability of the Fleet.  Command and Fleet community assistance 
is required to identify candidates with strong operational performance, and 
ideally, strong academic backgrounds in science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematic fields of study. 
 
2.  To be eligible for board consideration, a command-endorsed application in 
line with reference (a) must be received by MyNavy Career Center (MNCC) no 
later than 11 May 2023.  Additional documentation (including carrier air wing 
commander/carrier air group endorsements, letters of recommendation, fitness 
reports, etc.) will be accepted until 9 June 2023 but must be submitted by 
the applicant as a letter to the board in line with subparagraph 4a below.   
The applicant's e-mail address(es), phone number(s), college transcripts, 
anthropometric data measurement record, current physical readiness 
information management system body composition assessment report, and post-
TPS test squadron assignment preferences must be included with the 
application.  Willingness or unwillingness to accept Air Test and Evaluation 
Squadron Two Four (UX-24) as a follow-on tour performing unmanned aircraft 
systems developmental testing must be explicitly stated.  Current contact 
information (ashore and afloat) of the applicant's commanding officer must 
also be included to expedite notification if selected. 
 
3.  The command endorsement must explicitly state whether the applicant, if 
selected, will be allowed and available to report for pre-arrival training by 
the following dates: 
    a.  Fixed wing pilots:  9 October 2023. 
    b.  Rotary wing pilots:  30 October 2023. 
    c.  NFOs:  4 December 2023. 
Endorsements with availability dates after these respective dates may be 
removed from consideration and not reviewed by the board. The inability of 
the applicant to report by the above date may be mitigated by conducting 
initial training in a temporary additional duty (TEMADD) status at the 
expense of the endorsing command.  If this is required, it must be explicitly 
stated in the command endorsement that the endorsing command will provide 
TEMADD funds until the applicant can officially detach. 
 
4.  Application package submissions: 
    a.  The preferred method of application submission is electronic.  E-mail 
encrypted PDF submissions to cscselboard@navy.mil and carbon copy to

6.  Eligibility: 
    a.  Designated naval aviators and NFOs through the grade of 
lieutenant commander, who are qualified for flight duties and have 
not been terminated from flying status, are eligible for selection. 
    b.  The preferred aviators are junior officers (O-2 or O-3) with 
designator 13X0 and detailer-forecasted career timing to complete 
the selected TPS program and a 36-month follow-on test tour prior to 
their expected department head tour.  If there are not enough 
qualified junior officers to meet requirements, lieutenant 
commanders with exceptional records may be selected, provided they 
can meet follow-on test tour requirements and applicable career 
milestones. 
    c.  Aerospace engineering duty officer (1510) aviators through 
the grade of lieutenant commander may be selected if they are able 
to serve a 36-month follow-on test tour and still meet career 
milestones. 
    d.  Applicants determined to have insufficient career timing to 
meet a minimum test tour of 24 months may have their application 
removed from consideration. 
    e.  Applicants should ensure they have a valid government 
passport that will not expire prior to the completion of the class.
