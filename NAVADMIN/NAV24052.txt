RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the policy and guidance for 
Calendar Year (CY) 2024 season one Meritorious Advancement Program 
(MAP) for Active Duty (Active Component and Training and 
Administration of the Reserve (TAR)) Sailors.  MAP season one runs 
from 15 March through 15 April 2024. 
 
2.  MAP quotas are distributed over two seasons during CY24, with 
roughly half of the available MAP quotas allocated for each season. 
This aligns MAP with the Navy-Wide Advancement Exam (NWAE) to ensure 
any unused MAP quotas are included in the NWAE cycle, and to 
emphasize the intent of MAP to select and reward top-performing 
Sailors.  To meet required Time-in-Rate (TIR) for MAP advancement 
eligibility to the higher paygrade, Sailors must have a date of rank 
no later than the following: 
    a.  E-5:  1 January 2023 
    b.  E-5 (Nuclear-Trained Sailors):  1 January 2022 
    c.  E-4:  No TIR requirement. 
    d.  E-3 and junior:  There will be no MAP to E2 through E4 this 
year in order to support transition to time-in-service based 
advancements to E2 through E4 beginning 1 July in line with 
reference (a). 
 
3.  Future of Apprentice MAP.  Beginning in 2025, Navy will offer 
quotas for Commanding Officers (CO) to conduct MAP advancement to E4 
for top performing E3 Sailors who have accrued at least 12 months' 
time-in-service.  Quotas will be provided on an annual basis.  There 
will no longer be MAP advancement to E2 or E3. 
 
4.  Timeline: 
    a.  MAP Pre-season:  1-14 March 2024.  Budget Submitting Office 
(BSO) quotas will be promulgated separate coordination for planning 
purposes. 
    b.  MAP Quotas Uploaded:  14 March 2024 
    c.  CY24 Legacy MAP Season 1:  15 March 2024 - 15 April 2024 
 
5.  In line with references (b) and (c), MAP advancement to 
ABE2, ABE1, ABF2, ABH2, AME2, AO2, CS2, DC2, DC1, EM2, GM2, GSM2, 
IC2, MM2, QM2, and RS2 is not authorized due to those Sailors having 
advancement opportunities within Detailing Marketplace Assignment 
Policy (DMAP).  Additional details are located on the MyNavy HRs 
DMAP website,  
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Detailing/Enlisted/Detailing-
Marketplace/ 
 
6.  Commands are required to have two Navy Standard Integrated 
Personnel System (NSIPS) MAP user roles (command reviewer and 
command reporting senior) to submit MAP advancements, Exceptions to 
Policy (ETPs) and additional MAP quota requests through NSIPS. 
NSIPS Web Afloat users and commands without access to NSIPS should 
refer to paragraph 6a of this message for instructions on submitting 
their MAP advancements.  The system uses authoritative data to 
determine eligibility.  However, commands are required to locally 
validate that MAP candidates have successfully completed the 
Professional Military Knowledge Eligibility Examination (PMK-EE) 
requirement for E5 and E6 MAP advancements only (PMK-EE requirement 
for E4 was removed in line with reference (a)) prior to the first 
day of the MAP season (15 March 2024) as outlined in reference (d). 
For training on user roles, log into NSIPS via 
https://www.nsips.cloud.navy.mil/, click on training tab, then click 
MAP tutorial (JPA). 
    a.  NSIPS Web Afloat users and commands without access to NSIPS 
must submit a MAP nomination request via e-mail directly to their 
Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC), Type Commander (TYCOM) or 
Budget Submitting Office (BSO)/echelon II command using the 
Meritorious Certification Letter (MCL).  The letter must be signed 
by the CO and should address any ETP and/or additional quotas 
requested.  Sample MCLs and detailed information regarding the 
offline process can be found via MyNavy HR at 
https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Enlisted-Career-Admin/Advancement/MAP/. 
    b.  Quota usage, modifications, and distribution will be managed 
within the NSIPS environment.  BSO and command quotas will be 
uploaded into NSIPS on 14 March 2024 and can be found under the 
quota summary report tab.  Quotas can also be found via the MyNavy 
HR website:  https://www.mynavyhr.navy.mil/Career-Management/Community-
Management/Enlisted-Career-Admin/Advancement/MAP/. 
    c.  Additional quotas can be requested using the quota request 
option by the command reviewer user role in NSIPS.  Commands must 
contact their BSO to determine timeline for additional quota 
requests.  Whether or not command quotas are authorized, all 
commands can request quotas from their BSO/echelon II command, via 
their ISIC and TYCOM. 
    d.  NSIPS will automatically determine if an ETP is required 
using predetermined criteria.  Service Members in ratings requiring 
security clearances and rates/pay grades requiring TIR waivers will 
be automatically routed for adjudication.  The request will be 
routed through the ISIC, TYCOM, and BSO/Echelon II command using a 
hierarchical workflow. 
    e.  NSIPS will not automatically generate an ETP for nuclear- 
trained Service Members.  Commands desiring to advance a nuclear- 
trained Service Member not meeting the TIR requirement must send 
notification to the Nuclear Enlisted Community Manager (N133D) at 
bullnuke@navy.mil.
