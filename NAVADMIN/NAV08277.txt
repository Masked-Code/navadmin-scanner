CHANGES TO THE NAVY'S PRP.  
ALL POLICY CHANGES WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE NEXT REVISION OF REF A.  
2.  SINCE 2005, NAVY HAS MADE STRIDES TO SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE PHYSICAL 
FITNESS.  WE HAVE ADDED NEW TESTING OPTIONS FOR THE 
PHYSICAL READINESS TEST (PRT) AND INTRODUCED A NEW PHYSICAL TRAINING 
UNIFORM (PTU).   ADDITIONALLY, NEW CAPABILITIES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE 
PHYSICAL READINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (PRIMS) TO TRACK 
WAIVERS.
3.  THE FOLLOWING PRP POLICY CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE 1 OCTOBER 2008: 
    A.  UNLESS THE MOST RECENT PHYSICAL FITNESS ASSESSMENT (PFA) WAS 
PASSED, PERSONNEL WHO HAVE FAILED TWO PFAS IN THE PAST THREE YEARS WILL 
NOT BE ASSIGNED TO:
        (1) OVERSEAS BILLETS
        (2) PRE-COMMISSIONING BILLETS

        (5) INSTRUCTOR DUTY
    B.  WAIVER DOCUMENTATION.  THE CAPABILITY TO ENTER ALL WAIVERS 
(INCLUDING PROGRESS AND READINESS) WILL BE AVAILABLE IN PRIMS ON 1 
OCTOBER 2008.  THROUGH PRIMS, OPNAV N135F WILL MONITOR AND REPORT 
COMPLIANCE OF DATA ENTRY AND STATUS OF SAILORS WHO REQUIRE ADSEP 
PROCESSING.  COMMANDERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING ALL PFA-RELATED 
WAIVERS ARE DOCUMENTED IN PRIMS BY 15 DECEMBER 2008.
4.  ADMINISTRATIVE SEPARATIONS.  FOR THOSE OFFICER AND ENLISTED MEMBERS 
WHO FAIL THE PFA THREE TIMES IN A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD, MANDATORY 
PROCESSING FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SEPARATION (ADSEP) REMAINS IN EFFECT.  
THE GUIDANCE IS CONTAINED IN REF A. 
5.  WAIVERS.  IN 2005, THE REVISED PRP INSTRUCTION PROVIDED POLICIES TO 
ASSIST IN THE TRANSITION TO THE NAVY'S CURRENT FITNESS STATE.  
EFFECTIVE 1 OCTOBER 2009, PROGRESS WAIVERS, DETAILED IN REF A, CH-1, 
APPENDIX D TO ENCLOSURE (8), WHERE COMMANDING OFFICERS GRANT WAIVERS TO 
THOSE PERSONNEL WHO DEMONSTRATE CONSISTENT IMPROVEMENT TOWARDS MEETING 
PRP STANDARDS, ARE DISCONTINUED.

WIDELY COMMUNICATED.  SENIOR LEADERS ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE SUCCESS OF 
THEIR PRP AND SHOULD ACTIVELY LEAD COMMAND PHYSICAL FITNESS TESTING AND 
ENSURE ALL COMMAND PFA DATA IS ACCURATELY ENTERED IN PRIMS.
7.  THE MAJORITY OF NAVY SAILORS PERFORM THE PFA SEMI-ANNUALLY AND CAN 
EASILY MEET OR EXCEED THE MINIMUM PHYSICAL FITNESS STANDARDS.  I 
CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO CONTINUE THE EXCELLENT PROGRESS WE'VE MADE TO 
IMPROVE NAVY'S OVERALL PHYSICAL FITNESS FOR THE IMPROVED HEALTH AND 
READINESS OF THE FORCE.
