AMPN/REF A IS NAVADMIN 313/18, PROFESSIONAL MILITARY KNOWLEDGE ELIGIBILITY 
EXAM BUSINESS RULES.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the release of the Professional Military 
Knowledge Eligibility Exam (PMK-EE) Application (App) for use on mobile 
devices.  The PMK-EE App was created to provide flexibility to Sailors in the 
completion of their E-4 through E-7 advancement eligibility requirements.  
Reference (a) provides the business rules and eligibility requirements as 
they pertain to PMK-EE.  All Sailors must successfully complete PMK-EE as 
outlined in reference (a) regardless of their path to advancement.

2.  The PMK-EE App is currently available through the Navy App Locker and via 
the Apple and Android App stores under the name PMK-EE.
    a.  The PMK-EE App can be downloaded to and opened on a mobile device 
without the need for a common access card.
    b.  Once an exam has been downloaded to a mobile device, the App can be 
used with or without an internet connection.
    c.  Upon exam completion, the Sailor will input their Department of 
Defense Identification (DoD ID) Number into the App.  Once the DoD ID is 
submitted, completion information is transferred to the Navy Training 
Management and Planning System (NTMPS)/Electronic Training Jacket (ETJ).  
Sailors must be connected to the internet to transfer exam completion data.

3.  Completion Status and System Reporting
    a.  Sailors working in a restricted environment using the PMK-EE App will 
have to back up their progress to an external device, or complete the PMK-EE 
exam and transfer the completion information to NTMPS/ETJ, prior to exiting 
the restricted environment.  PMK-EE progress/completion information will be 
lost if the mobile device memory is erased prior to departing the restricted 
environment.
    b.  PMK-EE completed via Navy e-Learning, submarine on-board training or 
a mobile device, will automatically be updated in the Sailors NTMPS/ETJ.  
NTMPS/ETJ should update the advancement eligibility check on the Enlisted 
Advancement Worksheet (EAW) to *yes* indicating PMK-EE is complete.  If the 
NTMPS/ETJ does not automatically update the PMK-EE successful completion on 
the EAW, the command Educational Services Officer (ESO) can upload the 
passing certificate of the Sailor to NTMPS/ETJ and change the PMK-EE status 
on the EAW from *No* to *Yes*.  The ESO can change *Advancement Ineligible* 
to *Advancement Eligible* at this time if all other eligibility requirements 
have been met.  At this time, the PMK-EE App and Navy e-Learning systems 
operate independently.  This means that in order to generate a completion 
certificate, Sailors must complete all five modules of the PMK-EE within the 
same system.
    c.  The Fleet Training Management and Planning System (FLTMPS) can be 
used to generate command completion reports for PMK-EE.  The following steps 
access the automated report:

        (1) Log into FLTMPS.
        (2) Click on the *Report Search* button at the top of the Screen.
        (3) Type *PMK* in the *Search for Report* box, click *Search*, then 
click on the PMK-EE link once it appears.
        (4) On the report screen, select one of the options from the report 
criteria table.
(5) Enter the command unit identification code or activity name and run the 
report.
(6) The command completion report will list all Sailors who have completed at 
least one PMK-EE.

4.  For more information or concerns, contact the PMK-EE Help Desk Help Desk 
at (850) 473-6014/DSN 753 or via e-mail at sfly_pmkee_questions(at)navy.mil 
or MyNavy Career Center at (833) 330-6622 or (901) 834-6622 or via e-mail at
