RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces termination of Navy's flying Chief 
Warrant Officer (CWO) "Pilot" program and transition of affected 
aviators.

2.  The Navy's flying CWO "Pilot" program was conceived and 
initiated during a period of high Unrestricted Line (URL) aviation 
accessions to evaluate the effectiveness of replacing a small number
of URL aviators with CWOs unencumbered by the career progression 
requirements of the URL officer.  While the program has produced 
quality aviators, the URL inventory profile has changed and a 
requirement for flying CWOs no longer exists.

3.  Transition options outlined in paragraphs 5 and 6 only apply to 
CWOs commissioned under the flying CWO "Pilot" program.  Grade 
determinations and Dates of Rank (DOR) will differ based on years of
commissioned service, program option(s) and current policies.  

4.  Flying CWOs have several options for transition focusing 
primarily on aviation community health and keeping qualified 
aviators in the cockpit.  Affected CWOs may apply for transition to 
URL, Restricted Line (RL), retain CWO status, or apply for Limited 
Duty Officer (LDO).  Officers determined not eligible or not 
selected for transition will continue to serve as flying CWOs as 
outlined in ref (a).  

5.  Transition options for CWOs qualified as naval aviators and 
actively serving in a flying status are: 
    a.  Request appointment as a pilot or Naval Flight Officer (NFO)
in the URL of the active component (AC).  Officers desiring this 
option should submit request to:  Director, Military Community 
Management (BUPERS-3) via their Commanding Officer.  Request can be 
mailed or when possible, an electronic "PDF" submission will be 
accepted by the Aviation Officer Community Manager (OCM) via 
encrypted e-mail at freda.hudspeth(at)navy.mil.  Sample request is
available online at http//www.public/navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/
detailing/aviation/pages/flyingcwoprogram.aspx.  CWOs recommended 
for transition by BUPERS-3 will be forwarded for appointment to the
grade of lieutenant in the United States Navy by the Secretary of 
Defense (SECDEF) via Chief of Naval Personnel and Secretary of the 
Navy.  SECDEF approved appointments will be effective as soon as 
practical but no earlier than outlined in para 8.  Officers who have
not earned a baccalaureate degree must request an education waiver 
in the body of the application.  Appointed officers who fail to 
complete a baccalaureate degree face significant risk of failure of 
selection to lieutenant commander and aviation department head.
    b.  Request appointment to pilot or NFO in the URL of the 
Reserve Component (RC) as a Full Time Support (FTS) officer.  CWOs 
desiring to apply to the RC FTS URL must do so via the FTS lateral 
transfer/re-designation board.  Applicants for FTS pilot or NFO must
possess a baccalaureate degree and be fully qualified in 
type/model/series.  CWOs selected for appointment under this option 
will be appointed to the grade of lieutenant with a DOR determined 
by gaining and losing placement, generally at officer's projected 
rotation date.  CWOs who apply for FTS and are not accepted due to 
quota limitations will have a one-time option to apply for AC URL 
appointment with effective DOR as soon as practical after approval 
but NLT outlined in para 8.
    c.  Elect to retain CWO status.  CWOs desiring this option must 
notify the CWO OCM via digitally signed encrypted e-mail at 
mitchell.allen(at)navy.mil.  CWOs electing this option will continue
to serve in flying and non-flying aviation billets until voluntarily
or statutorily separated.  CWOs electing to retain CWO status will 
compete for promotion and be subject to the provisions of ref (b). 

6.  Transition options for CWOs under the flying CWO program but no 
longer in an active flying status may: 
    a.  Request appointment in the RC as an FTS Aviation Maintenance
Duty Officer (AMDO).  Education waivers for AMDO may be requested if
within six months of degree completion and will be considered on a 
case-by-case basis.  Those CWOs requesting and receiving waivers 
must complete baccalaureate degree prior to appointment.  Grade 
determinations for CWOs selected under this option will be based on
years of commissioned service as follows.
        (1) Less than two years; appointment to ensign;
        (2) More than two but less than four years; appointment to 
lieutenant junior grade;
        (3) Four or more years; appointment to lieutenant.
DOR for officers selected under this option will be the effective 
date of RC appointment; typically aligned to member's current 
projected rotation date.
    b.  Request re-designation to other CWO or appointment to an LDO 
designator for which they are qualified.  Procedures for 
re-designation to other CWO designators are outlined in ref (c).  
Appointment to LDO will be via the annual CWO to LDO in-service 
procurement board.  CWOs requesting re-designation to another CWO 
designator or appointment as an LDO must meet all qualifications for
applicable programs to include enlisted time-in-service and grade 
requirements of refs (d) and (e).  CWOs selected as an LDO will be
appointed as lieutenant junior grade regardless of years 
commissioned service IAW ref (d).

7.  Due to potentially negative financial implications, officers 
currently "in-zone" for promotion to CWO4 may opt to await selection 
board results prior to submission of transition request.  Submission
of transition request following CWO4 selection board may result in 
appointment to lieutenant occurring later than outlined in para 8.  
Flying CWOs accepting promotion to CWO4 will not have the option to 
transition.  Flying CWOs who have twice failed to select to the next 
higher warrant officer grade will not have the option to transition.

8.  AC URL transitions will take place in four phases.  Transition 
dates maximize community health relative to year group and provides
flying CWOs opportunity to meet URL career progression goals.  
Appointments will be made as follows:
    a.  Phase 1 will be September 2013 with officers commissioned in 
FY-07 being appointed to the grade of lieutenant with a DOR NLT 
1 September 2013.
    b.  Phase 2 will begin October 2013 with officers commissioned 
in FY-08, FY-09 and FY-10.
        (1) Officers commissioned in FY-08 will be appointed to the 
grade of lieutenant with DOR NLT 1 October 2013.  
        (2) Officers commissioned in FY-09 will be appointed to the
grade of lieutenant with DOR NLT 1 April 2014.
        (3) Officers commissioned in FY-10 will be appointed to the
grade of lieutenant with DOR NLT 1 September 2014.
    c.  Phase 3 will be July 2015 with officers commissioned in 
FY-11 appointed to the grade of lieutenant with DOR NLT 1 July 2015.
    d.  Phase 4 will be April 2016 with officers commissioned in 
FY-12 appointed to the grade of lieutenant with DOR NLT 
1 April 2016.

9.  Transition cut-off dates for officers eligible to apply for 
transition or awaiting CWO selection board results must submit 
request for transition or declare permanent warrant officer status 
NLT:
    a.  1 March 2014 for officers commissioned in FY-07;
    b.  1 March 2015 for officers commissioned in FY-08/09/10;
    c.  1 January 2016 for officers commissioned in FY-11;
    d.  1 October 2016 for officers commissioned in FY-12.
Officers who take no action by dates listed above will be considered 
as having opted for permanent CWO status and will be subject to laws 
and policies of active duty CWOs.
