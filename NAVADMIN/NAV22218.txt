the promotion, and not be tendered the promoting appointment.  The delay 
authority will immediately forward the notification of delay with supporting 
documentation to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-83), copy to COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-806).

promoting are mentally, physically, morally and professionally qualified in 
accordance with 10 U.S.C. 14311.  Per reference (a), officers are ineligible 
for promotion if they have failed the most recent Physical Fitness
