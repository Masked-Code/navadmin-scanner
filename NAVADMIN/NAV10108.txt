RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN REEMPHASIZES NAVY POLICY ON DRUG ABUSE AND    
PROHIBITS POSSESSION OF THE SUBSTANCES DESIGNATED IN PARA 5.  THIS   
MESSAGE CONSTITUTES A LAWFUL GENERAL ORDER APPLICABLE TO ALL         
UNIFORMED PERSONNEL IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY.  THE PROHIBITION      
CONTAINED IN PARA 5 WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE NEXT REVISION OF   
REF B.                                                               

2.  THE NAVY SEPARATED 1,374 SAILORS AS A RESULT OF DRUG ABUSE IN    
FY09 AND 303 SAILORS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FY10.  DRUG ABUSE   
PUTS LIVES AND MISSIONS AT RISK, UNDERCUTS UNIT READINESS AND MORALE,
AND IS INCONSISTENT WITH OUR NAVY ETHOS AND CORE VALUES OF HONOR,    
COURAGE, AND COMMITMENT.                                             

3.  NAVY POLICY ON DRUG ABUSE IS SIMPLE AND CLEAR - ZERO TOLERANCE.  
NAVY PERSONNEL DETERMINED TO BE UNLAWFULLY USING, POSSESSING,        
PROMOTING, MANUFACTURING, OR DISTRIBUTING DRUGS AND/OR DRUG ABUSE    
PARAPHERNALIA SHALL BE DISCIPLINED, AS APPROPRIATE, AND PROCESSED FOR
ADMINISTRATIVE SEPARATION.                                           

4.  PER REFS A AND B, DRUG ABUSE INCLUDES THE WRONGFUL USE,          
POSSESSION, MANUFACTURE, OR DISTRIBUTION OF A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE.  
DRUG ABUSE ALSO INCLUDES THE UNLAWFUL USE OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE    
ANALOGUES (DESIGNER DRUGS), NATURAL SUBSTANCES (E.G., FUNGI,         
EXCRETIONS), CHEMICALS (E.G., CHEMICALS WRONGFULLY USED AS           
INHALANTS), PROPELLANTS AND/OR PRESCRIBED OR OVER-THE-COUNTER DRUGS OR 
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS WITH THE INTENT TO INDUCE INTOXICATION, 
EXCITEMENT, OR STUPEFACTION OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND WILL 
SUBJECT THE VIOLATOR TO PUNITIVE ACTION UNDER THE UCMJ AND/OR ADVERSE
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION.  EXAMPLES OF OTHER SUBSTANCES, THE WRONGFUL   
USE OF WHICH CONSTITUTES DRUG ABUSE, INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO 
THE FOLLOWING:                                                       
A.  PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN SYNTHETIC CANNABINOID COMPOUNDS, SUCH AS   
SPICE, GENIE, BLAZE, DREAM, EX-SES, SPARK, FUSION, DARK KNIGHT,      
YUKATAN FIRE, AND K2.                                                
B.  NATURAL SUBSTANCES SUCH AS SALVIA DIVINORUM AND MUSHROOMS.       
C.  COMMON ITEMS ABUSED BY INHALING OR HUFFING, SUCH AS DUST OFF,    
GLUE, PAINT THINNER AND GASOLINE.                                    
D.  OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCTS SUCH AS ROBITUSSIN AND CORICIDIN HBP.  
E.  PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS SUCH AS OXYCODONE, VICODIN, ADDERAL, AND
VALIUM.                                                              

5.  POSSESSION PROHIBITED.  NAVY PERSONNEL WHO WRONGFULLY POSSESS    
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ANALOGUES (DESIGNER DRUGS), SALVIA DIVINORUM, OR
PRODUCTS CONTAINING SYNTHETIC CANNABINOID COMPOUNDS (INCLUDING THE   
PRODUCTS IN PARA 4.A ABOVE) MAY BE SUBJECT TO PUNITIVE ACTION UNDER  
THE UCMJ, ADVERSE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION, OR BOTH.                    

6.  DETERRENCE.  TO DETER DRUG ABUSE, WE MUST ELIMINATE ANY          
PERCEPTION AMONG POTENTIAL DRUG USERS THAT THEIR USE MAY GO          
UNDETECTED.  THIS REQUIRES A RIGOROUS URINALYSIS PROGRAM WITH        
FREQUENT, RANDOM, OBSERVED, AND UNANNOUNCED URINALYSIS TESTS.  REF B 
REQUIRES THAT ALL COMMANDS HAVE AN AGGRESSIVE URINALYSIS TESTING     
PROGRAM THAT RANDOMLY TESTS AT LEAST FOUR TIMES PER MONTH.  A MINIMUM
OF 15 PERCENT OF ASSIGNED PERSONNEL MUST BE TESTED EACH MONTH.       

7.  CONSULT YOUR STAFF JUDGE ADVOCATE OR REGION LEGAL SERVICE OFFICE 
FOR ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON SPECIFIC CASES.                           

8.  ALCOHOL AND DRUG CONTROL OFFICERS (ADCOS) CAN PROVIDE COMMAND    
LEADERSHIP WITH INFORMATION ON CURRENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE TRENDS.       
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING SPICE AND SALVIA DIVINORUM CAN BE FOUND AT 
HTTP://WWW.NPC.NAVY.MIL/COMMANDSUPPORT/NADAP/WHATSNEW.HTM.  

9.  CONSISTENT COMMUNICATION OF THE NAVY'S ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY,    
EDUCATION OF SAILORS AND COMMAND LEADERS, EFFECTIVE EXECUTION AND    
COMPLIANCE WITH URINALYSIS TESTING, AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE WHO 
CHOOSE TO ABUSE DRUGS WILL DETER DRUG ABUSE.  DETERRING DRUG ABUSE IS 
EVERY SAILOR'S RESPONSIBILITY.  JUST AS SHIPMATES DON'T LET SHIPMATES
DRINK AND DRIVE, SHIPMATES DON'T LET SHIPMATES DO DRUGS.
