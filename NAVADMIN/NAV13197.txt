MANUAL.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes ref (a) and establishes bonus 
eligibility for designated military skills and announces revised 
retention bonus award levels for Selected Reserve (SELRES) enlisted
personnel by rate/rating, NEC and zone.  This NAVADMIN incorporates 
many changes and must be read in its entirety.

2.  Increased award levels are effective immediately and decreased 
award levels are effective 30 days after the release of this 
NAVADMIN.

3.  To ensure operational effectiveness now and in the future, the 
Navy must retain the correct number of Sailors with the right skills
in the reserve component.  An effective retention plan requires 
flexible tools to ensure the Navy Reserve optimizes our warfighting 
capability.  The following paragraphs amplify the selective 
reenlistment bonus (SRB) program policy. 
    a.  General. 
        (1) All bonuses governed by this NAVADMIN will be paid in 
installments.  The initial payment will equal 50 percent of the total 
bonus amount.  Anniversary payments will be made annually based upon 
member maintaining satisfactory participation in the designated 
rate/rating for each year of their bonus contract.
        (2) A Sailor's current end of obligated service (EOS) date 
must fall within FY-13 with the following exceptions: 
            (a) Enlistment program exceptions:  National Call to 
Service (NCS) or new accession training (NAT) members completing 
their contractual SELRES participation requirement.  See paragraph 
5A for details.
            (b) Mobilization OBLISERV exception:  Members who have 
or had an EOS in FY-13 who extended their enlistment beyond 
30 September 2013 to incur required OBLISERV for mobilization orders,
may reenlist for SRB under this NAVADMIN provided the new contract 
end date exceeds member's previous EOS.  NOSC must submit copy of 
mobilization orders and NAVPERS 1070/621 authorizing 
extension of contract as supporting documentation. 
        (3) Sailors must have less than 20 years total federal 
military service as calculated from their pay entry base date (PEBD)
on the date of the qualifying reenlistment.  Per ref (b), bonus 
payments cannot be made beyond 24 years of service (YOS).  Members
with greater than 18 YOS from PEBD are limited to a 3-year bonus.  
Member's bonus obligation cannot exceed member's projected high year
tenure (HYT) date for their pay grade at the time of their 
reenlistment.
        (4) Extensions are not authorized to gain eligibility for 
reenlistment bonuses.
        (5) Navy Reserve Sailors currently serving under a contractual 
obligation for any prior bonus must be within 90 days of completing 
that obligation prior to reenlisting to qualify for a reenlistment 
bonus.  Failure to meet this requirement will result in early 
termination of the prior bonus and recoupment of the unearned portion
of that bonus.
        (6)  Per ref (c), Sailors may only receive one six-year or 
two consecutive three-year bonuses for reenlistment (exclusive of 
prior-service affiliation bonus) in a career.    
    b.  Rating conversion.  Current Selected Reserve Sailors who are
approved for change of rate to a bonus eligible rating listed in 
paragraph 7 may be eligible for a reenlistment bonus as follows: 
        (1) Change of rate approved via direct conversion. 
            (a) Sailors approved for a change of rate and whose EOS
conforms to the dates in paragraph 2, may reenlist immediately upon 
change of rate approval to qualify for a reenlistment bonus. 
            (b) The initial bonus payment shall be processed and paid
after reenlistment and immediately after Commander, Navy Reserve 
Forces Command (CNRFC) N11 receives the bonus application.  Note:  
Rate change must reflect in NSIPS before payment can be processed.
        (2) Change of rating approved via successful competition or 
concurrent change of rating. 
            (a) Sailors who successfully complete rate-conversion 
requirements and whose EOS conforms to the dates in paragraph 2, may
reenlist for a reenlistment bonus. 
            (b) Sailors who have successfully completed the change 
of rate requirements, but whose EOS does not conform to the dates in
paragraph 2, may request early reenlistment from PERS-812 to qualify
for a reenlistment bonus.  Both the early reenlistment request and 
the change of rate request must be submitted at the same time.
            (c) The initial bonus payment shall be processed and paid 
to Sailors in this category only after completing all requirements to 
permanently affect the change of rate.
    c.  All other basic eligibility criteria contained in ref (c) 
remain in effect. 

4.  Eligibility determination and bonus application procedures.  Navy 
Reserve activities shall determine bonus eligibility per ref (c) and 
this message.
    a.  Complete bonus written agreement in the Reserve Bonus 
Application Module (RBAM).  Effective with this NAVADMIN, this is 
the only authorized method to complete enlisted bonus written 
agreements.  RBAM can be accessed via the Navy Reserve Homeport at
https://private.navyreserve.navy.mil/cnrfc/n-codes/n1/cnrfc_n112/rbam.
For questions contact COMNAVRESFORCOM (N11) incentive program 
specialists at (757) 322-2653/2649/6735/2656 DSN 262 or via e-mail 
at cnrfc_bonus_shop(at)navy.mil. 
    b.  Scan and submit all required documents listed on the CNRFC 
N112 Enlisted Incentives Homeport as a single (multiple page) pdf 
file to COMNAVRESFORCOM (N11) via RBAM.  Missing documents will delay
bonus payment processing.  If unable to scan documents, e-mail the
address above for guidance.

5.  Zone eligibility criteria.  
    a.  Zone A - Members with up to 8 YOS from PEBD.  Members in 
Zone A are eligible to reenlist if they have completed their 
enlistment program's required SELRES obligation in FY-13 regardless
of the time remaining on their initial military service obligation
(MSO).  Specifically:  
        (1) National Call to Service (NCS) Program.  Upon completion
of the required two year SELRES obligation, NCS members are eligible 
to reenlist provided the length of the new contract exceeds their MSO
and Current EOS.  
        (2) New accession training (NAT) Program.  Upon completion of 
the six year SELRES obligation, NAT members are eligible to reenlist 
provided the length of the new contract exceeds their MSO and current
EOS.
    b.  Zone B - Members with more than 8 years up to 14 YOS from 
PEBD. 
    c.  Zone C - Members with more than 14 years up to 20 YOS from

8.  Sailors serving in the rates and/or specialties listed in

9.  Termination and recoupment.  Per ref (c), failure to complete the
terms of the incentive obligation will result in termination of bonus
entitlement.
    a.  Certain conditions affecting participation will result in
recoupment of the unearned portion of the bonus entitlement per 
ref (c) paragraph 7.b.
    b.  Recoupment is at discretion of Secretarial process when a 
member fails to complete the terms of the incentive obligation in the
following circumstances in accordance with the complete policy cited
for each circumstance.  Note that recoupment action will be initiated
for these circumstances, until and unless the Secretarial process 
waives or remits recoupment:
        (1) Separation for medical reasons not covered by ref (c),
paragraph 7.a.(3), in per ref (b), Table 2-1, Rule 3;
        (2) Medical reasons preclude completion of incentive 
obligation, but member is not separated and continues in another 
capacity per ref (b), Table 2-1, Rule 4;
        (3) The Secretarial process determines that recoupment is 
contrary to a personnel policy or management objective, against 
equity or good conscience, or contrary to the best interest of the
United States per ref (b).

10.  Command and unit career counselors should actively screen their
SELRES Sailors for SRB eligibility.

11.  Per ref (d), a member who does not complete the terms of the
written agreement under which the member received a SELRES 
reenlistment bonus will be subject to termination of bonus 
eligibility and recoupment of unearned portions of the bonus 
received.
