AMPN/REF A IS APPENDIX G OF THE DON DEFENSE ACQUISITION WORKFORCE 
IMPROVEMENT ACT (DAWIA) OPERATING GUIDE.  REF B DEFINES THE PURPOSE AND 
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NAVY'S ACQUISITION WORKFORCE.//

RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ESTABLISHES A CAREER PATH THAT DEVELOPS A SELECT 
GROUP OF AVIATION ACQUISITION CORPS
(AC) UNRESTRICTED LINE (URL) OFFICERS TO ACHIEVE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS 
FOR MAJOR PROGRAM MANAGEMENT (MPM) SELECTION WHILE REMAINING 
COMPETITIVE FOR SEQUENTIAL MAJOR ACQUISITION COMMAND SLATING.  
DEVELOPMENT OF OFFICERS TO SERVE IN MPM POSITIONS REQUIRES A MINIMUM OF 
48 MONTHS AND UP TO 96 MONTHS OF EXPERIENCE IN ACQUISITION CODED OR 
RELATED BILLETS AND PROACTIVE POST COMMAND CAREER MANAGEMENT.  AC URL 
OFFICERS NEED TO POSSESS THE QUALIFICATIONS TO MANAGE THE DEVELOPMENT, 
ACQUISITION, AND LIFE CYCLE SUPPORT OF CURRENT AND FUTURE NAVAL 
PLATFORMS AND ASSOCIATED SYSTEMS AS MPMS.

2.  DIRECT ASSOCIATION WITH A MAJOR ACQUISITION PROGRAM, CERTIFICATION 
AND EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED IN REF A, AND SELECTION AS AN AC 
MEMBER ARE PREREQUISITES FOR CAREER PROGRESSION AND, ULTIMATELY, 
SELECTION AS A MPM.  EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS RESULT IN CAREER PATTERNS 
DIFFERENT FROM URL OFFICERS WHO SERVE EXCLUSIVELY IN THEIR PRIMARY 
WARFARE SPECIALTIES.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IS THE NEED FOR 
OFFICERS TO SERVE IN ACQUISITION RELATED BILLETS (VX, HX, NAVAIR) PRIOR 
TO AND FOLLOWING COMMANDER COMMAND.

3.  IN ORDER TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN A SUFFICIENT POOL OF AC URL 
OFFICERS QUALIFIED TO LEAD MAJOR ACQUISITION PROGRAMS, A COMPETITIVE 
SELECTION BOARD FOR MPM ELIGIBLE OFFICERS WILL BE ESTABLISHED 
CONCURRENT WITH THE SEMI-ANNUAL NAVAIR SLATING PANEL.  OFFICERS 
IDENTIFIED FOR SELECTION AS MPM ELIGIBLE WILL BE THOSE WHO HAVE 
ACQUIRED SUFFICIENT ACQUISITION-RELATED TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE TO 
POSITION THEM FAVORABLY FOR EVENTUAL MPM SELECTION.  APPLICATIONS FOR 
MPM ELIGIBLE SELECTION BOARD ARE NOT NECESSARY AND SELECTION WILL NOT 
OBLIGATE OFFICERS SELECTED TO ENTER THE MPM ELIGIBLE ACQUISITION CAREER 
PATH.  SELECTION WILL BE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING
CRITERIA:
    A.  WITHIN 12 MONTHS OF COMPLETING AVIATION COMMANDER COMMAND TOUR.
    B.  MINIMUM OF 42 MONTHS ACQUISITION EXPERIENCE AT THE END OF 
COMMAND TOUR (INCLUDING UP TO 18 MONTHS CREDIT FOR COMMANDER COMMAND).
    C.  LEVEL II DAWIA CERTIFICATION IN ANY CAREER FIELD (MINIMUM LEVEL 
I PM QUAL), WITH ABILITY TO ACHIEVE LEVEL III WITHIN 24 MONTHS PER REF 
A.
    D.  MASTERS DEGREE OR ABILITY TO COMPLETE WITHIN
24 MONTHS.

4.  OFFICERS WHO ARE SELECTED AS MPM ELIGIBLE AND DO NOT ACCEPT BY 
OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE PRIOR TO NEGOTIATING POST-COMMAND ORDERS WILL 
NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR FUTURE ACCEPTANCE INTO THE MPM ELIGIBLE PIPELINE, 
BUT MAY APPLY FOR ACQUISITION BILLETS THROUGH NORMAL DETAILING 
PROCESSES OR SELECTION BOARD SCREENING.
OFFICERS WHO ARE SELECTED AS MPM ELIGIBLE AND ACCEPT BY OFFICIAL 
CORRESPONDENCE WILL BE CONTACTED PRIOR TO NEGOTIATING POST-COMMAND 
ORDERS TO ESTABLISH A POST-COMMAND CAREER PATH NECESSARY TO COMPLETE 
THE FOLLOWING EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING MILESTONES:
    A.  EXPERIENCE:  UP TO 48 MONTHS AS A LEVEL I INTEGRATED PRODUCT 
TEAM LEAD, DEPUTY PROGRAM MANAGER OR EQUIVALENT SERVICE IN A PROGRAM 
MANAGEMENT OFFICE FOR UP TO A TOTAL OF 96 MONTHS ACQUISITION EXPERIENCE 
(INCLUDING UP TO 18 MONTHS CREDIT FOR COMMANDER COMMAND).
    B.  TRAINING:  AS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE LEVEL III PM CERTIFICATION.

5.  ACCEPTED OFFICERS WILL COMPETE FOR MAJOR PROGRAM MANAGER COMMAND 
AND MAJOR ACQUISITION SHORE COMMAND (FRC, DCMA), BUT WILL NOT COMPETE 
FOR AVIATION MAJOR OPERATIONAL COMMAND.  OFFICERS SELECTED WILL BE 
DESIGNATED VIA AN ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATION DESIGNATOR (AQD).  JOINT 
SPECIALTY OFFICER/JOINT QUALIFIED OFFICER REQUIREMENTS FOR APPOINTMENT 
TO O-7 WILL BE WAIVED IAW SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WAIVER PER REF B FOR 
OFFICERS NOT ABLE TO COMPLETE JSO REQUIREMENTS DUE TO ACQUISITION-
