SUBJ/OBSERVANCE OF HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 2011//

RMKS/1.  WE WILL OBSERVE HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH FROM 15 SEPTEMBER -
15 OCTOBER 2011.  THE NATIONAL THEME FOR THIS YEAR IS "MANY BACKGROUNDS, MANY 
STORIES...ONE AMERICAN SPIRIT."  THIS MONTH CELEBRATES THE GENERATIONS OF 
HISPANIC AMERICANS WHO HAVE INFLUENCED AND ENRICHED OUR NATION.

2.  HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH TRACES ITS ORIGINS TO SEPTEMBER 1968, WHEN 
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON PROCLAIMED A NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE WEEK.  THE 
WEEK WAS EXPANDED IN 1988 BY PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN TO ENCOMPASS A MONTH-LONG 
COMMEMORATION TO CELEBRATE THE HISTORIES, CULTURES, AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF 
AMERICANS WHO TRACE THEIR ROOTS TO SPAIN, MEXICO, THE CARIBBEAN, AND CENTRAL 
AND SOUTH AMERICA.

3.  THE STRENGTH OF OUR NAVY AND NATION IS DERIVED FROM THE DIVERSITY OF OUR 
PEOPLE.  TODAY, NEARLY 60,000 HISPANIC SAILORS AND OFFICERS SERVE IN THE 
UNITED STATES NAVY, PARTICIPATING IN EVERY FACET OF NAVAL OPERATIONS.  THREE 
HISPANIC FLAG OFFICERS AND 158 HISPANIC MASTER CHIEFS LEAD OUR NAVY FROM THE 
FRONT, PROVIDING UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIENCES THAT ENHANCE OUR CULTURE 
AND IMPROVE OUR MISSION READINESS.

4.  OUR HISPANIC SAILORS AND OFFICERS REPRESENT THE VERY BEST OF OUR NATION, 
AND ARE REFLECTIVE OF A LONG LEGACY OF SERVICE BY HISPANIC AMERICANS.  NOTABLE 
EXAMPLES INCLUDE DAVID GLASGOW FARRAGUT, SON OF A SPANISH IMMIGRANT, WHO IN 
1866 BECAME THE NAVY'S FIRST ADMIRAL; NAVY PILOT EVERETT ALVAREZ, WHO ENDURED 
EIGHT YEARS OF TORTURE AND SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AS A PRISONER OF WAR IN 
VIETNAM HOSPITAL CORPSMAN LUIS E. FONSECA, JR., WHO WAS AWARDED THE NAVY CROSS 
FOR SAVING THE LIVES OF SEVERAL WOUNDED MARINES DURING THE 2003 BATTLE OF 
NASIRIYAH, IRAQ; AND COMMANDER YVETTE DAVIDS, WHO BECAME THE FIRST HISPANIC 
WOMAN TO COMMAND A SURFACE COMBATANT WHEN SHE TOOK COMMAND OF THE USS CURTS 
(FFG 38) IN 2007.
