RMKS/1. The Air Traffic Control Association (ATCA) will hold the 
Joint-Service Air Traffic Control (ATC) Symposium in Myrtle Beach, SC 
at the Sheraton Convention Center from 16-18 August 2022. This forum 
provides a vehicle for senior military and civilian professionals to 
enlighten, inspire, enhance retention, and educate E-4 through E-6 
DoD air traffic controllers on the technological advances, 
operational enhancements, and policy changes that have taken place 
within the air traffic control profession. The event is a combination 
of briefs, panels, working groups, and industry interaction. Industry 
representatives for air traffic management equipment, simulators, and 
software provide displays that serve to educate and prepare 
controllers for future opportunities and challenges to military air 
traffic control. 
Topics include: 
- The Future of Naval Aviation and Air Force ATC 
- US Navy and USMC Air Traffic Control Strategic Plan and Evolution Roadmap 
- The National Airspace System 
- ATC Equipment & Technology 
- Landing Zone Operations 
- Career Development and Advancement Opportunities 
- Training and Readiness Discussions 
 
2. Primary goals are to reinforce the professional excellence of the 
air traffic control community and enhance retention within the 
critical E-4 through E-6 paygrades. While the focus is on our active 
duty members, all DoN and USAF, civil service, retired, enlisted, and 
officer ATC professionals are cordially invited to attend. 
 
3. Per reference (a) through (c), Commanding Officers may issue 
orders for attendance at government expense after determining that 
the expenses, including fees, travel costs, and other costs 
attributable to participation, justify the objectives to be achieved. 
TAD orders may cover expenses to support attendance and participation 
at the conference including transportation and per diem per reference (b). 
 
4. If funds are not available, permissive TAD orders may be issued. 
Use of available government transportation and carpooling is 
encouraged to enhance conference participation and to minimize travel 
expenses. Commands may also reduce costs by using double occupancy 
for lodging. Rental cars are highly discouraged and unnecessary for 
symposium participants. Participants flying to the symposium should 
use a taxi or ridesharing to the hotel.
