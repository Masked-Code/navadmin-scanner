SUBJ/ADMINISTRATION OF THE NAVY-WIDE ADVANCEMENT EXAMINATION FOR
/SAILORS IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, AND THE HORN OF AFRICA//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS IS THE THIRD IN A SERIES OF NAVADMINS
DETAILING NAVY INITIATIVES FOR OUR SAILORS WHO ARE MAKING
SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS BY SERVING ON THE GROUND IN THE FRONT
LINES OF THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM (GWOT).  SPECIFICALLY,
THIS NAVADMIN PROVIDES OPTIONS FOR ADMINISTERING NAVYWIDE EXAMS
TO SAILORS WHO ARE PENDING DEPLOYMENT TO, OR ARE DEPLOYED AND
OPERATING IN, IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, OR THE HORN OF AFRICA.
THESE GUIDELINES WILL APPLY TO E4-E7 EXAMINATIONS FOR BOTH ACTIVE
DUTY AND RESERVE PERSONNEL AND IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.
2.  THE NECESSARY CHANGE TO THE ADVANCEMENT MANUAL HAS BEEN MADE
DIRECTING THAT NO NAVYWIDE EXAMS WILL BE ADMINISTERED TO PERSONNEL
SERVING IN-COUNTRY IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, AND HORN OF AFRICA.  SAILORS
WILL BE AUTHORIZED TO TAKE EARLY EXAMS PRIOR TO DEPLOYING, OR TAKE
EXAMS AFTER RETURN FROM DEPLOYMENT WITH SCORING MEASURED AGAINST THE
EXAM CYCLE MISSED.  SAILORS WILL BE ADVANCED, IF QUALIFIED, AS OF
THE DATE THEIR FINAL MULTIPLE MAKES THEM ELIGIBLE AS DETAILED BELOW.
3.  SAILORS WHO ARE WITHIN 60 DAYS OF A PENDING DEPLOYMENT TO IRAQ,
AFGHANISTAN, OR THE HORN OF AFRICA, AND ARE ELIGIBLE IN ALL
RESPECTS, MAY REQUEST AN EARLY EXAM.  EARLY EXAMS MUST BE TAKEN AND
ANSWER SHEETS MUST BE TRANSMITTED PRIOR TO DEPARTING ON DEPLOYMENT.
COMMANDS WILL SUBMIT EARLY EXAM REQUESTS IN THE SAME FORMAT AS A
SUBSTITUTE EXAM  REQUEST.  REASON FOR EARLY EXAM WILL BE "CANDIDATE
PENDING IN-COUNTRY DEPLOYMENT TO IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, AND HORN OF
AFRICA."  WHEN TRANSMITTING THE ANSWER SHEET AFTER THE EXAM,
COMMANDS SHOULD INDICATE IN THE SUBJECT LINE THAT THE ANSWER SHEET
IS BEING TRANSMITTED FOR AN EARLY EXAM CANDIDATE.
4.  SAILORS WHO ARE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE IN ALL RESPECTS TO
PARTICIPATE IN AN EXAM CYCLE AND ARE CURRENTLY DEPLOYED, WILL
PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED NAVYWIDE EXAM UPON THEIR
RETURN.  PROCESSING WILL OCCUR AS FOLLOWS:
A.  ANSWER SHEETS.  WHEN TRANSMITTING ANSWER SHEETS FOR THESE
INDIVIDUALS, COMMANDS WILL IDENTIFY CANDIDATES IN A SEPARATE
ENCLOSURE TO THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, IN THE SAME MANNER THAT
"EARLY PROMOTE" CANDIDATES ARE CURRENTLY, UNDER THE HEADING "IRAQ,
AFGHANISTAN, HORN OF AFRICA CANDIDATES."  IN A COLUMN BESIDE THE
EXAM SERIAL NUMBER, COMMANDS SHOULD LIST THE MISSED CYCLE(S).
B.  EXAM SCORING.  AFTER THE EXAM IS SCORED, FINAL MULTIPLE SCORES
WILL BE COMPETED AGAINST THE EXAM CYCLE(S) MISSED, STARTING WITH
THE EARLIEST MISSED CYCLE.  NETPDTC (N321) WILL APPLY THE FINAL
MULTIPLE SCORE TO THE PREVIOUS (MISSED) EXAM CYCLE(S) AND IF THIS
SCORE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN ADVANCEMENT, THEN NETPDTC (N321) WILL
RECORD THE ADJUSTED ADVANCEMENT DATE TO THE PREVIOUS CYCLE, ISSUE
A RATING CHANGE AUTHORIZATION, AND NOTIFY NAVPERSCOM
(PERS-48/PERS-3) TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AFFECTED
AREAS OF THE SAILORS SERVICE RECORD.
(1) SAILORS WHO MISS TWO EXAM CYCLES WILL BE AFFORDED TWO MAKE UP
EXAM CYCLES.  FOR EXAMPLE:  A PO2 IS ASSIGNED IA TO IRAQ FOR THE
PERIOD DEC 2006 THROUGH NOV 2007, THUS MISSING BOTH THE MAR 2007
AND SEP 2007 EXAMS.  THAT SAILOR MAY TAKE THE MAR 2008 PO1 EXAM AND
HAVE IT COMPETED AGAINST THE MAR 2007 EXAM (THE FIRST EXAM CYCLE
MISSED).  IN THE CASE OF A QUALIFYING FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE, THE
CANDIDATE WILL BE ADVANCED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. IF SCORED PNA OR
FAIL,THE EXAM WILL THEN BE COMPETED AGAINST THE SEP 2007 EXAM
(THE SECOND CYCLE MISSED). IN THE CASE OF A QUALIFYING FINAL
MULTIPLE SCORE, THE CANDIDATE WILL BE ADVANCED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.
IF THE SECOND EXAM IS SCORED PNA OR FAIL, THE SAILOR COMPETES
NORMALLY IN SUBSEQUENT CYCLES.
5. IN THE CASE OF CPO EXAMS, UPON RETURN, THE SAILOR SHOULD REQUEST
A LATE EXAM. IF THE EXAM IS SCORED SELBD ELIG, AND THE SELECTION
BOARD HAS ADJOURNED, NPC WILL CONVENE A SPECIAL CPO SELECTION BOARD.
IF THE CPO CANDIDATE RETURNS DURING THE PERIOD SEP-DEC, THE SAILOR
WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED CPO EXAM (JAN).
THE EXAM WILL BE COMPETED AGAINST THE EXAM CYCLE MISSED AND A
SPECIAL SEL BD WILL BE CONVENED IF A SELBD ELIG SCORE IS ATTAINED.
IN THE CASE OF A SELBD INELIG SCORE, THE EXAM WILL BE COMPETED
AGAINST THE CURRENT CYCLE FOR SELECTION BOARD ELIGIBILITY OR
INELIGIBILITY.
A.  REQUESTS FOR SUBSTITUTE CPO EXAMINATIONS SHOULD BE REQUESTED
VIA MESSAGE PER TABLE 4-3 OF THE ADVANCEMENT MANUAL (BUPERSINST
1430.16E) TO NETPDTC (N321), INFO COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4811)
(PERS-4812 FOR FTS AND RECALLED RESERVISTS).  REQUESTS MUST INCLUDE
THE MBR'S NAME, RATE, LAST 4 OF THEIR SSN, AND JUSTIFICATION FOR
MISSING THE REGULAR EXAMINATION.
B.  ADMINISTERING THESE SUBSTITUTE CPO EXAMINATIONS ON A SPECIFIC
DATE OR TO ALL SAILORS ON THE SAME DATE WITHIN THE SAME COMMAND IS
NOT REQUIRED.
6.  THE PROCEDURES OUTLINED ABOVE WILL BE REPEATED IN THE ROUTINE
NAVADMIN WHICH PROMULGATES EACH EXAM CYCLE.
7.  THIS NAVADMIN APPLIES ONLY TO THOSE SAILORS SERVING IN IRAQ,
AFGHANISTAN, OR HORN OF AFRICA. IF FUTURE MISSION REQUIREMENTS
DEMAND OUR SAILORS TO FIGHT THE FRONT LINES OF GWOT IN OTHER
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, IT WILL BE EXPANDED AS APPROPRIATE.  FOR SAILORS
WHO ARE NOT DEPLOYING TO OR WHO ARE NOT ALREADY DEPLOYED TO IRAQ,
AFGHANISTAN, AND THE HORN OF AFRICA, SUBSTITUTE EXAM PROCEDURES
CONTAINED IN THE ADVANCEMENT MANUAL (BUPERSINST 1430.16E) AND THE
