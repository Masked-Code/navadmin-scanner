SUBJ/ADJUSTMENT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS TECHNICIAN, SUBMARINES RATING 
(CORRECTED COPY)// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN directs realignment of the Information Systems 
Technician, Submarines (ITS) rating into three separate service 
ratings.  Sailors in the three separate ratings will possess the foundational 
skills that enable them to maintain shipboard local area networks, while 
pursuing mastery in either a Network (ITN), Electronic Warfare (ITE), or 
Communications (ITR) specialization career path.  The adjusted service 
ratings will apply to Active Duty and Selected Reserve (SELRES) Sailors and 
billets.  ITE will not be available as a SELRES rating.  In the future, 
billets for both shore and sea will be based on the specialization Rating 
Control Numbers (RCN) and aligned to enhance the career paths of our Sailors. 
 
2.  These revised ratings will be available to all ITS Sailors. 
 
3.  Navy Manpower Analysis Center (NAVMAC) is authorized to make appropriate 
changes in the Total Force Manpower Management System (TFMMS) to convert 
billets as identified and provided by Submarine Forces (SUBFOR). 
 
4.  For E1-E9 Active Duty personnel, commands will coordinate with their 
Immediate Superior in Command (ISIC), SUBFOR Type Commanders (TYCOM), and 
Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS-322) to select which career path best suits 
the needs of the Navy, the command, and the Sailors.  Sailors who have 
received approval for retirement prior to the rating conversion date of 
paragraph 7 below are exempt from this rating realignment.  SELRES personnel 
realignment will be coordinated by BUPERS-352.  Commands should ensure that 
each Sailor selects an appropriate career path based on their current Navy 
Enlisted Classification (NEC) codes and qualifications.  Amplifying 
information on the process for selecting career paths will be provided via a 
separate execute order. 
 
5.  While the shipboard network knowledge base will be shared, these career 
paths will be distinct; each managed by separate training pipelines and NEC 
codes.  All submarine IT Sailors will become knowledgeable in network 
fundamentals, but will be specialists in communications, Network security, or 
electronic warfare.  Each rating will have its own Navy-wide Advancement 
Examination (NWAE) and advancement quotas.  Rating exams and quotas will be 
managed by separate enlisted management codes.  NWAEs will have a base of 
network operations with questions pertinent to the specialized rating.   
Current advancement policies will continue unaltered. 
 
6.  The following are dates for submission of career path selection lists for 
ITN, ITE or ITR:
