RMKS/1.  Purpose.  To announce the Department of the Navy observance of 
Insider Threat Awareness Month in September 2021. 
 
2.  Protecting Sailors, Marines, civilians, contractors and their families 
from insider threat(s) is a Navy priority.  The Navy Insider Threat Program 
will use the month of September 2021 to promote insider threat 
awareness.  The Navy intent is to assist commanders and provide commands with 
early intervention and assistance for individuals that may be in need or 
facing hardship in their lives. 
 
3.  Insider Threat Definition.  As defined in reference (a), a threat 
presented by a person who: 
    a.  Has, or once had, authorized access to information, a facility, 
network, person, or resource of the Department; and 
    b.  Wittingly, or unwittingly, commits: 
        (1) An act in contravention of law or policy that resulted in, or 
might result in, harm through the loss or degradation of government or 
company information, resources, or capabilities; or 
        (2) A destructive act, which may include physical harm to another in 
the workplace. 
 
4.  The Navy Insider Threat Program is designed to prevent, detect, deter, 
and mitigate insider threat risks.  The program focuses on measures aimed at 
preventing unauthorized disclosure of classified information as well as 
deterring future workplace violence or harm to Navy personnel or resources. 
 
5.  This year’s Government-wide theme for Insider Threat Awareness Month is 
Cultural Intelligence.  Cultural Intelligence refers to the skill of relating 
and working effectively in culturally diverse situations.  It is the ability 
to cross boundaries and excel in a multi-cultural workforce environment.  As 
the Navy continues to build an inclusive culture that encourages, supports 
and celebrates diversity, it allows for the workforce to become unified in 
order to better identify and assist individuals that may be in crisis. 
 
6.  The Navy Insider Threat Program encourages everyone to be observant and 
recognize concerning behaviors.  Early identification of individuals in need 
of assistance is key.  Recognize the signs and report insider threat concerns 
to the Navy Service Analysis Section of the Department of Navy Analytic Hub 
at 703-695-7700, insiderthreat.fct(at)navy.mil, or 
https://www.secnav.navy.mil/itp/Pages/default.aspx. 
 
7.  Counter-Insider Threat educational and training resources can be found at 
the following:  https://www.cdse.edu/resources/posters-insider-
threat.html and can be posted in common areas. 
 
8.  The Navy will continue to support the national and Department of Defense 
effort to counter insider threats.  Keeping the workforce safe requires your 
vigilance and timely reporting of any suspicious activity or potentially 
threatening behaviors observed.  This partnership is essential to our 
nation’s ability to counter the threat from within.
