SUBJ/CHANGE TWO TO OPNAVINST 7220.11D NUCLEAR OFFICER INCENTIVE 
PAY// 

REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/01AUG13//
AMPN/REF A IS OPNAVINST 7220.11D, NUCLEAR OFFICER INCENTIVE PAY.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN promulgates a change to ref (a), and 
announces changes to the nuclear officer incentive pay (NOIP) 
continuation pay (COPAY) rates.

2.  Navy leadership remains committed to retaining top-performing 
nuclear-trained officers.  Effective immediately, due to declining 
retention rates, the NOIP COPAY annual rate for nuclear-trained 
surface warfare officers is raised from $30,000 to $35,000 per year.  
This is one of several initiatives in progress to retain top 
performing nuclear-trained surface warfare officers.

3.  This new continuation pay rate of $35,000 for 3-YR, 4-YR, 5-YR, 
6-YR, and 7-YR contracts is for nuclear-trained surface warfare 
officers.  Since there is no longer an initial 3-YR COPAY agreement 
rate, the 3-YR rate change only applies to follow-on contracts.  The 
COPAY agreement rate for all other contracts remain unchanged.  For 
initial contracts, officers are obligated to complete a principal 
assistant tour.  Per ref (a), eligible officers serving on a COPAY 
agreement may re-negotiate a replacement contract with a period that 
extends to, or beyond, an existing agreement.  Officers desiring a 
replacement contract should submit their request in the format of 
enclosure (3) of ref (a).

4.  The annual incentive bonus rate remains unchanged at $12,500 for 
unrestricted line officers, $10,000 for limited duty officers, and 
$22,000 for captains with greater than 26 years of commissioned 
service or screened for major command/major program manager.  The 
nuclear officer accession bonus amount also remains unchanged.

5.  Questions regarding NOIP should be directed to Navy Personnel 
Command (PERS-42D1), at (901) 874-3145/DSN 882. 

6.  This message will remain in effect until ref (a) has been 
revised.
