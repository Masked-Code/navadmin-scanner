SUBJ/FY-18 NAVY GRADUATE EDUCATION UPDATE//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the FY-18 Navy graduate education quota 
plan.

2.  This plan provides education opportunities to enhance warfighting and 
support capabilities consistent with defense and Navy strategic guidance.  It 
prioritizes programs that develop expertise in the Middle-East, Asia-Pacific 
regions, cyberspace, undersea warfare, and requirements management.  In 
addition, the plan provides the foundation to sustain our technological 
advantage and develop the skills to plan for and operate the Navy of the 
future while eliminating strategic and operational vulnerabilities.

3.  The FY-18 plan provides about 1,450 funded opportunities for degree and 
non-degree programs across the full spectrum of communities and ranks that 
include over 400 quotas at Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), 140 quotas at top 
civilian universities, 225 quotas at the Naval War College, 175 quotas at 
Joint and other service colleges, 19 quotas at international military 
colleges, 30 quotas dedicated to training with industry opportunities for 15 
officer/15 enlisted personnel, and 5 opportunities to serve on the Secretary 
of the Navy Naval innovation advisory council.

4.  The FY-18 plan incorporates the new Requirements Management (RM) 
community 6511 Subspecialty Code (SSC) family.  6511 will include the new SSC 
6501 (3 quotas) and 6502 (2 quotas) which are based on existing NPS 
curricula.

5.  Enlisted graduate education opportunities will continue to be offered in 
the Cyber Systems Operation program, which allows up to five enlisted 
personnel per year to obtain a 12 month in-residence masters degree at NPS.

6. The Navy continues to offer various fellowship programs, including the 
Federal Executive Fellowship (15 quotas/year), White House Fellowship (1 
quota/year), Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellowship (2 quotas/year), 
Legislative Fellowship (15 quotas/year), and the Navy Supply Corps Training 
with industry program (4 quotas/year).

7.  In addition, there are many other programs for officers to gain advanced 
education such as the political military masters program (8 quotas/year), the 
Olmsted Scholarship program (6 quotas/year), the Law Education program (6 
quotas/year), and the Unrestricted Line Graduate Education Voucher program 
(32 quotas/year).  All Navy personnel are encouraged to explore education 
opportunities with their detailer or mentor as an integral part of a career 
development strategy.

8.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever comes first.
