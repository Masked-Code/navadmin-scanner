Rmks/1. This NAVADMIN solicits applications for the 2025 Navy Legislative 
Fellows Program. The Legislative Fellows Program allows naval officers 
(O-3 to O-5), senior enlisted (E-7 to E-9), and Department of the Navy 
civilian employees (GM/GS-13 above or equivalent) to broaden their 
understanding of the legislative process and the operation of the U.S. 
Congress through a year-long, full-time assignment to the office of a 
member of the House of Representatives or the Senate. The Legislative 
Fellows Program also enhances the ability of the Navy to fulfill its 
role in the national policy development process. Typical responsibilities 
of a fellow include drafting legislation, hearing preparation, analysis 
of public policy, and serving as a congressional liaison to constituents 
and industry. 
 
2. This is a highly competitive program. Applicants must have exceptional 
written and verbal communication skills, display maturity and critical 
thinking, and show a proven ability to work in a dynamic environment. 
Records must reflect sustained superior performance and potential for 
future assignments in critical billets. Upon completion of the program, 
officers earn the Legislative Fellowship Additional Qualification 
Designation (AQD 234). 
 
3. Military Applicants. The program is available to both Officers and 
Enlisted. 
   a. Officer Applicants. Participation is open to all Active Duty and 
Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) unrestricted line, 
restricted line, and staff corps officers in the permanent grades of 
O-3 through O-5. The selection process will focus on individual 
performance, promotion potential, academic and subspecialty 
qualifications, needs of the Navy, and availability for follow-on 
assignment. Officers with permanent change of station orders already 
issued will not be considered. All officer applicants must contact 
their detailers for counseling on the career impact of participation 
in the Legislative Fellowship Program. Officers should plan for an 
immediate follow-on utilization tour or assignment upon completion of 
the fellowship, in line with Ref (a). 
   b. Enlisted Applicants. Participation is open to all Active Duty 
Navy ratings in the permanent grades of E-7 through E-9. The selection 
process will focus on individual performance, promotion potential, 
academic and additional qualifications, needs of the Navy, and projected 
rotation date. Sailors with permanent change of station orders already issued 
will not be considered. Following the fellowship, Sailors will be assigned to 
a single 24-month utilization tour supporting a role determined by the Office 
of Legislative Affairs (OLA), which will include time in OLA and in the 
Office of the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy. 
   c. All military applicants must be available for permanent change of 
station assignment to the Washington, DC, area in November 2024. Following 
orientation at OLA, fellows will begin a 12-month assignment in January 
2025 in a Congressional office. During the Fellowship, officers and senior 
enlisted Sailors will be assigned to OLA for administrative purposes. 
In accordance with reference (b), upon execution of orders, fellows 
must agree in writing to serve on active duty following completion or 
termination of the fellowship for a period of three times the duration 
of the fellowship. 
   d. In addition to the application requirements listed in reference (a), 
applicants are requested to submit the last three years of Officer Fitness 
Reports or Enlisted Evaluations as part of their package. 
   e. Military applicants shall submit applications via e-mail to the OLA 
point of contact no later than 22 December 2023. 
   f. Points of contact are: 
      (1) OLA: CDR Rebeca Rodriguez, Navy Legislative Fellows Program 
Manager, (703) 697-2885 or Rebeca.S.Rodriguez.mil(at)us.navy.mil 
      (2) PERS: Outservice Education Placement and Special Fellowships 
Branch, PERS 443, pers-440_submit.fct@navy.mil 
      (3) GENERAL: Questions on other Navy fellowship programs should be 
directed to CDR Anne Stehlin, Fellowships and Scholarships Management, 
OPNAV N712, (571)-256-4784 or Anne.C.Stehlin.mil(at)us.navy.mil. 
 
4. Civilian Applicants. The program is available to senior civilian employees 
(GM/GS-13 and above or equivalent). 
   a. For the duration of the fellowship, civilian fellows will 
remain under administrative control of their respective parent command. 
Training and travel costs incurred as part of the fellowship shall be paid by 
the parent command. 
   b. Civilian employees interested in the Legislative Fellowship Program 
must contact their local civilian training officer for information on 
submission of applications for the 2025 program. Notably, civilian 
participation in the Fellowship Program differs from military requirement in 
that civilian selectees do not participate in a rotational assignment post-
Fellowship and will return to their command and position. Civilian selectees 
must be able to report for the role in November 2024 for orientation at 
OLA followed by 12-month placement in a Congressional office 
(January 2025 - December 2025). 
   c. Questions concerning Department of the Navy civilian participation 
should be directed to Ms. Sherri Hirn, (202) 685-6493 or 
Sherri.A.Hirn.civ@us.navy.mil. Additional information is available at:

es/Developmental-Programs-Offerings.aspx 
 
5. Following administrative screening of packages submitted by the 
deadline, OLA will notify applicants of selection for interview or 
non-selection status. OLA makes the final determination of applicant 
selection or non-selection to the fellowship program.
