SUBJ/ NOTICE OF CONVENING FY-22 NAVY RESERVE OFFICER PROMOTION SELECTION 
BOARDS (PART I)//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces Part I of the Notice of Convening
FY-22 promotion selection boards.  Due to the delay of FY-21 promotion 
selection board results, which were impacted by COVID-19 stop movements, the 
FY-22 promotion selection boards will be divided into two parts.  Part I will 
consist of promotion selection boards to recommend officers on the Reserve 
Active-Status List (RASL) for permanent promotion to the grades of captain, 
commander and lieutenant commander in the line, with the exception of 
officers on the RASL for permanent promotion to the grade of lieutenant 
commander in the Full Time Support (FTS) Unrestricted Line (URL); and 
officers on the RASL for permanent promotion to the grades of captain and 
commander in the staff corps.  Part II will consist of promotion selection 
boards to recommend URL (FTS) officers on the RASL for permanent promotion to 
the grade of lieutenant commander, officers on the RASL for permanent 
promotion to the grade of lieutenant commander in the staff corps, and 
officers on the RASL for permanent promotion to the grade of chief warrant 
officer.  A NAVADMIN announcing Part II of the Notice of Convening FY-22 
promotion selection boards will be released at a later date.

2.  Part I of the FY-22 promotion selection boards will be convened as 
follows:
     17 MAR 21 - Unrestricted/Restricted Line Captain
     17 MAR 21 - Unrestricted/Restricted Line Commander
     8 APR 21  - Staff Corps Captain/Commander

following list indicating the names, reserve precedence numbers, and dates of 
rank of the senior in-zone and junior in-zone eligible for consideration for 
promotion in each competitive category as of the date of this NAVADMIN.  In

4.  Officers in the grades of lieutenant, lieutenant commander and commander 
are elgible for consideration for promotion only if they have served 
continuously on either the RASL or Active Duty List (or a combination of both 
lists) during the one-year period ending on the date of the convening of the 
promotion board.  Accordingly, officers returning to an active status from a 
period of inactive or broken service (USNR-S2, discharge) are eligible for 
consideration for promotion only after continuously serving in an active 
status for one full year.  Membership in the Individual Ready Reserve does 
not qualify for deferment of eligibility for consideration.

5.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a promotion selection board 
via the Letter to the Board (LTB) process.  NAVADMIN 220/19 announced the 
introduction of a new application known as Electronic Submission of Selection 
Board Documents (ESSBD), accessible through MyNavy Portal (MNP).  ESSBD 
improves the speed, transparency, and confidence of receipt over current LTB 
submission methods, such as hard copy and e-mail submitted letters and 
related attachments.
    a.  ESSBD will be available for all promotion and selection boards.
    b.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to electronically 
submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without attachments and 
will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) exactly what will 
be delivered and presented to the board.
    c.  To use ESSBD, candidates must access document services through MNP at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record.  On-screen instructions will direct 
the submitter thereafter.
    d.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted.  If required, a full visual user 
guide is available at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-
promotion.
    e.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command not later than 2359 
(central standard time (CST)) 10 days prior to the convening date of the 
respective board, as noted below.  Submitters are cautioned not to wait until 
the deadline date to submit LTBs via ESSBD or other available avenues.

    f.  If sending a board package from a non-NMCI network (bumed.mil, 
eu.navy.mil, etc.), please review procedures listed in NAVADMIN 220/19.
    g.  The written communication may call attention to the board any matter 
concerning the record of the officer that the officer considers important.  
Written communication may include, as enclosures, correspondence from any 
individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not originated by 
the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of the eligible 
officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must contain a written 
acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she desires such 
correspondence be presented to the board.
Correspondence without such an acknowledgement is considered third- party 
correspondence and will be returned without being presented to the board.  
Classified correspondence will not be accepted.

6.  Questions regarding LTB submission should be directed to MyNavy Career 
Center by calling 1-833-330-MNCC (1-833-330-6622 / DSN: 882- 6622).

7.  All officers are reminded it is their responsibility to ensure their 
personnel records are substantially accurate and complete.

8.  The CSCSELBOARD(at)NAVY.MIL mailbox account is capable of receiving 
encrypted correspondence in accordance with Department of Defense policy.  If 
you are sending your board package from a non-NMCI network please visit
