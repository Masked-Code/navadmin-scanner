SUBJ/98TH NAVY RESERVE ANNIVERSARY MESSAGE//

RMKS/1.  AS WE MARK THE 98TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NAVY RESERVE, I WANT TO THANK 
ALL NAVY RESERVE SAILORS WHO ARE SERVING OUR NATION AT HOME AND ABROAD, AND 
THE FAMILIES, EMPLOYERS, AND COMMUNITIES WHO SUPPORT THEM.

2.  SINCE THE RESERVE FORCE'S ESTABLISHMENT ON 3 MARCH 1915, RESERVE SAILORS 
HAVE CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE IN EVERY MAJOR 
CONFLICT.  OVER THE LAST DECADE, NEARLY 70,000 SAILORS  HAVE BEEN MOBILIZED, 
PROVIDING BOTH READY UNITS AND INDIVIDUAL  AUGMENTEES TO SUPPORT NAVY AND 
JOINT FORCE EFFORTS IN COMBAT  OPERATIONS, HUMANITARIAN, AND DISASTER RELIEF 
MISSIONS AROUND THE  WORLD.

3.  NAVY RESERVISTS, SERVING IN ALL GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY, OFFER 
UNIQUE SKILL SETS AND INSIGHTS FROM THEIR CIVILIAN CAREERS THAT ENRICH THE 
DIVERSITY OF OUR NAVY.  THE RESPONSIVENESS, CONTINUED READINESS, AND 
DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT TO SERVICE OF OUR RESERVE SAILORS ARE CRITICAL 
ELEMENTS THAT ENABLE OUR NAVY TO ACCOMPLISH ITS MISSION.  FROM YOUR SUPPORT OF 
HOMELAND DEFENSE, TO  DEPLOYING FORWARD, YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TOTAL FORCE 
PROVE THAT  YOU ARE READY, RELEVANT, AND ALIGNED TO THE NAVY'S MISSION AND 
CORE  VALUES.

4.  AS WE LOOK FORWARD, THERE IS A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR THE NAVY RESERVE, WITH 
INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SAILORS TO PARTICIPATE IN EMERGING MISSION AREAS.  
I ENCOURAGE YOU TO "BE READY" WHEN CALLED TO SERVE.  I THANK EACH OF YOU, YOUR 
FAMILIES, AND SUPPORTING EMPLOYERS FOR SERVING OUR NAVY AND OUR NATION WITH 
HONOR, COURAGE, AND COMMITMENT.

5.  RELEASED BY ADMIRAL JONATHAN W. GREENERT, CHIEF OF NAVAL  OPERATIONS.//
