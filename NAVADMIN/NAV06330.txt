SUBJ/SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES NEW AWARD LEVELS FOR THE 
REGULAR COMPONENT AND RESERVE COMPONENT FULL TIME SUPPORT (FTS) AND 
SUPERSEDES NAVADMINS 013/06, 155/06, 194/06, 195/06.  INCREASED AWARD 
LEVELS ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND DECREASED AWARD LEVELS WILL BE 
EFFECTIVE 29 DECEMBER 2006.  ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES IN THE DEFENSE 
JOINT MILITARY PAY SYSTEM PROCEDURES TRAINING GUIDE REMAIN IN EFFECT.
2.  THE SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS (SRB) PROGRAM ENHANCES THE NAVY'S 
ABILITY TO RETAIN SAILORS WITH CRITICAL SKILLS AND VALUABLE EXPERIENCE.  
COMMUNITY MANAGERS CONDUCT RIGOROUS ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE CURRENT AND 
FUTURE RETENTION TRENDS AND MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS.  SRB LEVELS ARE THEN 
STRATEGICALLY INCREASED AND DECREASED WITH THE GOAL OF OPTIMALLY 
SHAPING THE FORCE TO MAXIMIZE WAR-FIGHTING CAPABILITY.
3.  NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION (NEC) SPECIFIC SRB.  ACCEPTANCE OF A 
NEC SPECIFIC SRB CONTRACT INDICATES AWARENESS OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN 
THE SAILOR AND THE NAVY TO UTILIZE THE SKILLS ATTRIBUTED TO THE NEC 
DURING THE SAILOR'S ENLISTMENT TO MEET FLEET READINESS REQUIREMENTS.  
IN SUBSEQUENT TOURS A SAILOR MUST BE WILLING TO BE DETAILED DURING THE 
NORMAL PROJECTED ROTATION DATE WINDOW TO A BILLET AVAILABLE WITHIN THE 
SRB CONTRACTED NEC, CONSISTENT WITH SEA-SHORE ROTATION REQUIREMENTS.
4.  INFORMATION ON INCREASED AND DECREASED AWARD LEVELS.  AN ELIGIBLE 
MEMBER WITH A COMNAVPERSCOM APPROVED SRB REQUEST WHO HAS NOT YET 
REENLISTED OR EXECUTED A SRB QUALIFYING EXTENSION AND WHO WOULD BENEFIT 
FROM A HIGHER AWARD LEVEL UNDER THIS PLAN MUST RESUBMIT A SRB 
REENLISTMENT REQUEST TO QUALIFY FOR A HIGHER AWARD LEVEL.  A MEMBER IN 
A SKILL LISTED FOR REDUCTION OR TERMINATION OF AWARD LEVEL WHO HAS AN 
APPROVAL MESSAGE OR A PENDING PRECERT FOR A REENLISTMENT DATE AFTER 29 
DEC 06 MUST RESUBMIT A REENLISTMENT REQUEST FOR A NEW REENLISTMENT DATE 
PRIOR TO 29 DEC 06 TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE HIGHER AWARD LEVEL.  THE 
DATE-TIME-GROUP OF THE ORIGINAL COMNAVPERSCOM PRECERT RESPONSE SHALL BE 
INCLUDED IN THE REMARKS SECTION OF THE NEW REENLISTMENT REQUEST SO THE 
ORIGINAL REQUEST CAN BE CANCELLED.
5.  PERFORM-TO-SERVE (PTS) REQUIREMENTS.  A REQUEST FOR A MEMBER WHO 
REQUIRES PERFORM-TO-SERVE APPROVAL BEFORE REENLISTING SHALL NOT BE 
SUBMITTED UNTIL THE MEMBER HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THEIR PTS APPROVAL.
ANY REQUEST SUBMITTED IN ADVANCE OF PTS APPROVAL WILL BE DISAPPROVED.  
THE STATUS OF PTS APPROVAL MAY BE VIEWED ON THE OFFICER PERSONNEL 
INFORMATION SYSTEM UZ4/UN4 SCREEN.
6.  REENLISTMENT PROCEDURES.  A MEMBER MAY REQUEST TO REENLIST FOR A 
SRB AT ANY TIME WITHIN THE SAME FISCAL YEAR AS THEIR EXPIRATION OF 
ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE.  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT A MEMBER REENLIST AS 
CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THEIR EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE
(EAOS) TO PRESERVE THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF THEIR SRB PAYMENT.  BECAUSE A 
SRB IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF MONTHS FOR WHICH A MEMBER 
REENLISTS BEYOND HIS OR HER CURRENT EAOS, REENLISTING EARLY REDUCES THE 
SRB PAYMENT.  A MEMBER WHO MUST OBLIGATE SERVICE TO EXECUTE A PERMANENT 
CHANGE OF STATION MOVE MAY REENLIST ANY TIME WITHIN THE SAME FISCAL 
YEAR AS THE DETACHMENT MONTH, BUT NOT LATER THAN THE DATE OF DETACHMENT 
FROM THE LAST INTERMEDIATE DUTY STATION.  A MEMBER WHO MUST OBLIGATE 
SERVICE TO EXECUTE A HOMEPORT CHANGE CERTIFICATE MOVE MAY REENLIST AT 
ANY TIME WITHIN THE SAME FISCAL YEAR AS THE SHIFT MONTH.  A SRB 
REENLISTMENT UNDER THE SELECTIVE TRAINING AND REENLISTMENT PROGRAM FOR 
PERSONNEL OTHER THAN THOSE QUALIFIED IN NUCLEAR PROPULSION IS LIMITED 
TO EXECUTION WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THEIR EAOS.
7.  OBLIGATE SERVICE TO TRAIN AND THEN REENLIST.  A MEMBER WHO IS NOT 
ELIGIBLE FOR A SRB IN THEIR PRESENT RATING OR WHO DOES NOT HOLD A SRB 
ELIGIBLE NEC MAY QUALIFY FOR A SRB IF THEY CONVERT TO, OR TRAIN FOR, A 
SRB ELIGIBLE SKILL.  THE MEMBER MUST AGREE TO OBLIGATE SERVICE TO TRAIN 
FOR THE SRB-NEC AND THEN REENLIST AFTER THE NEW NEC IS ATTAINED OR ONCE 
RATING CONVERSION IS COMPLETED.  THE NEW RATING OR NEC MUST BE 
DESIGNATED FOR AWARD OF A SRB AT THE TIME OF THE AGREEMENT TO OBLIGATE 
SERVICE TO TRAIN.  A SRB MAY BE PAID FOR THAT
SPECIALTY:
    A.  IF ELIGIBLE TO CHANGE RATINGS OR TO TRAIN FOR THE NEC AND 
DESIGNATION PER THE MANUAL OF NAVY ENLISTED MANPOWER AND PERSONNEL 
CLASSIFICATIONS AND OCCUPATIONAL STANDARDS (NAVPERS 18068).
    B.  IF APPROVED FOR THIS OPTION BY THE MEMBERS DETAILER 
(COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-40XX)) AND ENLISTED COMMUNITY MANAGER 
(COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4011)).
    C.  UPON COMPLETION OF QUALIFICATION TRAINING AND REENLISTMENT IN 
THE SPECIALTY.
    D.  AT THE AWARD LEVEL IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE AGREEMENT OR AT 
THE AWARD LEVEL IN EFFECT AT REENLISTMENT, WHICHEVER IS HIGHER (AND AS 
DETAILED IN THE APPROVED SRB PRECERT).  IF A MEMBER CROSSES ZONES 
BETWEEN OBLIGATED SERVICE TO TRAIN APPROVAL AND REENLISTMENT, THE 
MEMBER CAN ONLY RECEIVE THE REENLISTMENT BONUS APPLICABLE TO THE NEW 
ZONE.
    E.  IF OTHERWISE QUALIFIED UNDER THE SRB ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.
    F.  IF THE SPECIALTY FOR WHICH THE MEMBER IS RECEIVING TRAINING IS 
NO LONGER DESIGNATED FOR A SRB AWARD AT THE TIME OF GRADUATION FROM 
TRAINING, THE MEMBER IS STILL AUTHORIZED FOR THE AWARD LEVEL THAT WAS 
IN EFFECT THE DAY THAT THE OBLIGATION OF SERVICE TO TRAIN WAS APPROVED.  
A SRB ELIGIBLE MEMBER CANNOT USE THIS OPTION TO DELAY REENLISTMENT TO 
ACQUIRE ADVANCE TRAINING OR OTHER NEC TO QUALIFY FOR A HIGHER PAYING 
AWARD LEVEL.  A MEMBER WHO CAN COMPLETE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS BEFORE 
THEIR EAOS IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THIS OPTION.  THE ABOVE CRITERIA SHALL 
NOT BE WAIVED.  AFTER THE APPROVAL AND WITHIN 35-120 DAYS PRIOR TO 
SCHOOL GRADUATION, THE REENLISTING SAILOR'S COMMAND MUST SUBMIT A 
REQUEST TO REENLIST FOR A SRB UNDER CODE 1CC IN THE TYPE AND CITE 
"OBLISERV TO TRAIN AND REENLIST" IN THE REMARKS SECTION ON THE 
PRECERTIFICATION.
8.  COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES.
    A.  A COMMAND MUST SUBMIT A SRB REENLISTMENT REQUEST BETWEEN 35-120 
DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE MEMBER'S EAOS OR REENLISTMENT DATE TO ENSURE THE 
APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL MESSAGE WILL REACH MEMBER'S COMMAND AND THE 
DEFENSE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING SERVICE BEFORE THE REENLISTMENT DATE.  
TIMELINESS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE THE APPROVED PRECERT NOTIFIES THE 
DEFENSE JOINT MILITARY PAY SYSTEM OF THE MEMBERS INTENT TO REENLIST, 
PREVENTS INTERRUPTION OF PAY, AND ENSURES THE INITIAL SRB PAYMENT POSTS 
TO THE MEMBER'S ACCOUNT.  A MEMBER MUST HAVE AN APPROVED PRECERT BEFORE 
REENLISTING, THOUGH THEY MAY WAIT TO REENLIST UP TO THEIR EAOS.
    B.  COMMAND INITIATING A SRB PRECERT MUST ENSURE ALL OF THE DATA 
INCLUDED IN THE PRECERT REQUEST MATCHES DATA IN THE MEMBER'S SERVICE 
RECORD OR THE COMMAND'S ENLISTED DISTRIBUTION VERIFICATION REPORT.
MANY SRB REQUESTS ARE REJECTED DUE TO ERRONEOUS DATA (E.G., SOCIAL 
SECURITY NUMBER, ACTIVE DUTY START DATE, OR EXPIRATION OF ACTIVE 
OBLIGATED SERVICE) OR DATA THAT CONFLICTS WITH THE ENLISTED MASTER FILE.
    C.  A MEMBER WITH AN APPROVED PRECERTIFICATION WHO DOES NOT 
REENLIST ON THE DATE SPECIFIED ON THE PRECERTIFICATION MESSAGE MUST 
CONTACT COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4811F), SRB EXECUTION SECTION AND HELP DESK 
AND INITIATE A REENLISTMENT CANCELLATION TO AVOID PLACING THE MEMBER IN 
AN OVERPAID STATUS.
9.  CANCELLATION OF NON-OPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  ANY MEMBER MAY CANCEL UP 
TO 24 MONTHS OF A NON-OPERATIVE EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT PROVIDED:
    A.  THE EXTENSION IS CANCELLED BEFORE IT BECOMES OPERATIVE.
    B.  THE MEMBER IMMEDIATELY REENLISTS FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS BEYOND 
THE EXTENDED EAOS, DAY-FOR-DAY.  THE CANCELLED INOPERATIVE EXTENSION 
WILL COUNT AGAINST MEMBER'S SRB AWARD UNLESS THE REENLISTMENT IS FOR 
GREATER THAN THE PERIOD OF THE INOPERATIVE EXTENSION PLUS TWO YEARS.
10.  PRECERT REQUIREMENTS.  THE FOLLOWING ARE REQUIRED WHEN SUBMITTING 
PRECERT REQUESTS:
    A.  TO VALIDATE AN OPERATIVE EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT AND TO 
EXPEDITE PROCESSING OF A SRB REQUEST, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN THE 
REMARKS PARAGRAPH OF THE REQUEST: TERM, NARRATIVE REASON, AUTHORITY, 
AND EXECUTION DATE OF ALL OPERATIVE EXTENSIONS.  FAILURE TO VERIFY 
EXTENSIONS WILL RESULT IN REJECTION OF THE REQUEST AND MAY DELAY ITS 
PROCESSING.
    B.  A CONDITIONAL EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT (ANY EXTENSION LESS THAN 
24 MONTHS) MUST MEET THE REASONS AND TERMS SPECIFIED IN OPNAVINST 
1160.6A AND MILPERSMAN 1160-040 AND 1160-080 AND MUST BE APPROVED BY 
COMNAVPERSCOM (PERS-4811).  FAILURE TO OBTAIN AN APPROVAL FOR EXTENSION 
MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF SRB ELIGIBILITY.
    C.  PERSONNEL IN A CLOSED LOOP NEC CAN REENLIST BY THE NEC ONLY.
11.  REVISED AWARD PLAN.
    A.  THE FOLLOWING RATINGS AND NECS ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR CONTINUED 
SUCCESS IN THE ONGOING GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM (GWOT) AND NAVY REMAINS 
COMMITTED TO ENSURING WE RETAIN THESE KEY SAILORS.
