RMKS/1.  The mission of the Navy depends not only on our Sailors, but also on 
our civilians who provide critical technical expertise, continuity of

the OPNAV (N1C) Sharepoint Folder.  OPNAV (N1C), with the assistance of the 
Civilian Adivsory Board, will support Commands in development and management 
of these strategies.  Each Command Strategy will be reviewed and an 
assessment will be provided to the CNO.

3.  Commands should include objectives that align to Civilian Workforce 
Framework goals as well as measures of outcome-oriented effectivness to 
monitor progress and ensure successful completion of these objectives.  Each

Provide a workforce plan that identifies a baseline of all current authorized 
civilian workforce billets and position requirements (skills and

employees and provide a succession plan for all critical positions reflecting 
changes to billets and position requirements across the Fiscal Year Defense 
Plan.
    c.  Talent management.  Provide a plan of how you will streamline any 
internal recruiting and hiring practices to ensure we are able to attract and 
retain the best talent.
    d.  Employee engagement.  Create a workplace where employees are 
proactively and passionately adding value while aligned to the Command 
mission.  Provide details on how you will enhance employee engagement, 
particularly in furthering an integrated military- civilian team.
    e.  Cost.  Provide estimated costs and methods for resourcing career 
development and education.

Functional Management and Community Sponsor engagement.
