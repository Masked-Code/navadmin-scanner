SUBJ/SPECIAL DUTY ASSIGNMENT PAY UPDATE FOR NUCLEAR TRAINED SAILORS// 
 
REF/A/DOC/OPNAV/5OCT17// 
REF/B/DOC/DOD/11JAN19// 
 
NARR/REF A IS OPNAVINST 1160.6C, SPECIAL DUTY ASSIGNMENT PAY PROGRAM.   
REF B IS DOD INSTRUCTION 1340.26 CHANGE 1, ASSIGNMENT AND SPECIAL DUTY 
ASSIGNMENT PAY.// 
 
RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces an update to the special duty 
assignment pay (SDAP) rate structure for nuclear trained Sailors 
with scheduled implementation.  Additionally, this NAVADMIN notifies 
the Fleet of upcoming pay changes for those Sailors meeting SDAP 
requirements.  No action is required by commands or MyNavy Career 
Center (MNCC) organizations to implement this revised SDAP 
structure.  Requirements to be eligible (e.g., active Navy enlisted 
classification (NEC), UIC, etc.) for SDAP in line with references 
(a) and (b) remain in effect.  This revision has no impact on SDAP 
assignment for reactor department conventional machinists mate (MM) 
and engineman (EN) Sailors.  Current SDAP levels remain in effect 
for reactor department conventional MM and EN Sailors.  This SDAP 
rate structure change goes into effect 60 days after the release of 
this NAVADMIN. 
 
2.  Purpose.  The updated SDAP structure better aligns compensation 
to the high level of training, qualifications, and responsibilities 
held throughout the totality of a nuclear-trained Sailors career. 
This rate structure supports detailing marketplace initiatives by 
incentivizing service at-sea, prototype assignments, and increased 
demands for supervisor NECs which are key to safe and reliable 
nuclear plant operation. 
 
3.  The SDAP rates for nuclear-trained Sailors are as follows for 
reactor department master chiefs (RDMC), engineering department 
master chiefs (EDMC), aircraft carrier nuclear division leading 
chief petty officers (CVN DLCPO), Naval Nuclear Prototype Unit 
(NPTU) and all active nuclear NECs: 
 
Billet / NEC            Level    Pay              Change 
RDMC/EDMC/CVN DLCPO     7        525.00           +75.00 
N33Z NEC                6        450.00           New 
NPTU W/SUPERVISOR NEC   6        450.00           No change 
SEA W/SUPERVISOR NEC    5        375.00           No change 
SHORE W/SUPERVISOR NEC  3        225.00           -75.00 
SEA W/OPERATOR NEC      2        150.00           No change 
SHORE W/OPERATOR NEC    1         75.00           -75.00 
 
4.  Eligibility.  Active nuclear NECs are required in order to be 
eligible to receive SDAP for nuclear trained Sailors.  Reference (a) 
consolidates all SDAP pay and policy. 
    a.  SDAP for nuclear trained Sailors is authorized at the rate 
commensurate with the primary NEC held.  The only billet based SDAP 
authorizations are associated with SDAP level 7, in which case, 
individuals are required to be serving in the billet recognized in 
paragraph 4.d below. 
    b.  Nuclear-trained Sailors at Navy Recruiting Commands will not 
be affected by this SDAP restructure and retain full eligibility for 
Navy Recruiting Command assigned SDAP, which takes precedence. 
    c.  Sailors holding NEC N59X or N89X may be eligible to receive 
SDAP while still performing duties assigned.  Specific approval must 
be obtained from the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV N133D) 
and will be started and stopped by N133D. 
    d.  Additional details for each category are as follows: 
        (1) SDAP Level 7.  Payable only to nuclear trained Sailors 
serving in the following billets:  EDMC, RDMC, TYCOM/GROUP/ISIC 
EDMC, TYCOM RDMC, Naval Reactors command master chief (CMC), Naval 
Nuclear Propulsion Training Command CMC, NPTU CMC, Nuclear Enlisted 
Quality Control Advisor (N133D2), Enlisted Submarine and Nuclear 
Assignment (PERS 403CA), or CVN DLCPO.  CVN DLCPOs must be serving 
as reactor electrical, reactor mechanical, reactor laboratories, 
reactor propulsion, or reactor controls division leading chief petty 
officer.  Additionally, CVN DLCPOs are eligible for SDAP Level 7 
when serving as reactor training division officer.  Only one person 
per command can be paid SDAP for each billet.  During periods of 
turnover, the incumbent will maintain level 7 until relieved. 
        (2) SDAP Level 6.  Payable to nuclear trained Sailors 
holding an active N33Z NEC and all instructor staff members with a 
supervisor NEC at any NPTU. 
        (3) SDAP Level 5.  No change to this SDAP level and remains 
payable to nuclear trained Sailors in an at-sea assignment with a 
supervisor NEC and without N33Z NEC.  Also payable to nuclear 
trained Sailors with a supervisor NEC assigned to nuclear repair 
tenders stationed in Guam. 
        (4) SDAP Level 3.  Payable to nuclear trained Sailors in a 
shore assignment with a supervisor NEC and without a N33Z NEC. 
        (5) SDAP Level 2.  Payable to nuclear trained Sailors in an 
at-sea assignment with an operator NEC. 
        (6) SDAP Level 1.  Payable to nuclear trained Sailors in a 
shore assignment with an operator NEC. 
 
6.  Implementation.  OPNAV N133D will implement all pay changes on 
behalf of commands for all Sailors requiring pay rate changes.  The 
estimated completion date of all pay adjustments is 74 days after 
the date of this NAVADMIN.  If a Sailor holds an NEC within a 
category not impacted by the updated SDAP structure (e.g., operator 
at-sea, supervisor at-sea), no changes will occur to that Sailors 
assigned SDAP.  Commands and MNCC organizations remain responsible 
for executing SDAP changes not associated with the revised SDAP 
structure specified in this NAVADMIN (e.g., gains, losses, and pay 
discrepancy resolution).  Sailors are encouraged to closely monitor 
and review their leave and earning statement following 
implementation.  Additionally, commands are required to complete 
their annual recertification in line with reference (a). 
 
7.  Point of contact.  OPNAV N133D2A at (703)604-5492 or email at 
bullnuke(at)navy.mil. 
 
8.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or 
cancelled.
