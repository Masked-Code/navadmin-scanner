GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THE FIRST WEEK OF JUNE 2006 MARKS THE 
COMMEMORATION OF THE 64TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF MIDWAY.  THIS 
BATTLE IS LARGELY REGARDED AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT VICTORIES 
WON BY AMERICAN SAILORS IN WORLD WAR II.  FOUGHT ON AND AROUND THE 
TINY CENTRAL PACIFIC ATOLL OF THE SAME NAME BETWEEN 4 AND 7 JUNE 
1942, IT MARKED THE POINT AT WHICH THE JAPANESE PACIFIC OFFENSIVE 
STOPPED AND THE ALLIED OFFENSIVE BEGAN.
