SUBJ/HAPPY THANKSGIVING//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE MULLEN FAMILY, I WISH YOU
ALL A VERY SAFE AND HAPPY THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY.  WE CERTAINLY HAVE
MUCH FOR WHICH TO BE THANKFUL.  TODAY, DUE IN NO SMALL MEASURE TO
THE DEDICATION OF BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN LIKE YOU, OUR NATION -- INDEED
THE WORLD -- IS A SAFER PLACE TO LIVE.
2.  AROUND THE GLOBE AND IN ALL MANNER OF WAYS, YOU ARE STANDING A
VIGILANT WATCH.  YOU HELP ENSURE PEACE AND STABILITY IN PLACES THAT
HAVE HISTORICALLY KNOWN NEITHER.  GIVING HOPE TO THOSE IN NEED AND
PAUSE TO THOSE WHO THREATEN FREEDOM, YOU MAKE SURE -- EVERY SINGLE
DAY -- THAT THE FIGHT REMAINS ON THE ENEMYS DOORSTEP.  IN PLACES
SUCH AS INDONESIA, PAKISTAN, AND EVEN OUR OWN GULF COAST, LIVES TORN
ASUNDER BY NATURAL DISASTER ARE, BY YOUR HANDS, BEING RESTORED AND
RENEWED.  THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE HELPED ARE GRATEFUL, AMERICANS
EVERYWHERE ARE GRATEFUL, AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SERVICE.
4.  THAT SERVICE, OF COURSE, CAN AND DOES DEMAND THE HIGHEST OF
SACRIFICES.  WE SHOULD BE ESPECIALLY MINDFUL THIS YEAR OF THOSE
FAMILIES WHO WILL HAVE ONE LESS CHAIR AT THE TABLE, AS WELL AS THOSE
WHO HAVE NO CHAIR AT ALL, MUCH LESS A HOME IN WHICH TO CELEBRATE IT.
THEIRS WILL BE A PARTICULARLY POIGNANT HOLIDAY, AND I ASK YOU TO
KEEP THEM IN YOUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS.
5.  FINALLY, I URGE YOU TO BE SAFE.  IF YOU ARE ABLE TO TRAVEL OVER
THE LONG WEEKEND, PLEASE ALLOW PLENTY OF TIME TO GET WHERE YOU ARE
GOING AND MAKE SURE YOU ARE PROPERLY RESTED.
6.  AGAIN, FROM MY FAMILY TO YOURS, ENJOY A VERY WELL DESERVED
THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY.  WE HAVE LOTS TO BE THANKFUL FOR - MOST
ESPECIALLY ALL OF YOU.
7.  ADM MIKE MULLEN.//
