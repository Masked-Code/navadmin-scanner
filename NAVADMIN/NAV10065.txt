RMKS/1. PHASED ADAPTIVE APPROACH (PAA), OUTLINED BY POTUS ON 17 SEP 09, HAS 
STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE TO THE NAVY.  ITS BROAD SCOPE ACROSS MULTIPLE NAVY 
STAKEHOLDERS REQUIRES CREATION OF AN ENTERPRISE THAT CAN RAPIDLY COORDINATE 
AND FOCUS KEY STAFFS AND LEADERSHIP TO BETTER ALIGN AND SYNCHRONIZE OUR 
ACTIONS AND OUR INTERACTIONS WITH THE OTHER SERVICES, JOINT STAFF, INTER-
AGENCY AND INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS.

2.  IN SUPPORT OF THIS CRITICAL EFFORT, I HAVE DIRECTED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 
THE NAVY BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE ENTERPRISE (NBMDE) TO ENABLE NAVY(S) 
ACTIONS AND INITIATIVES TO SUPPORT THE TIMELY EXECUTION OF PAA MILESTONES.  
THE NBMDE WILL ALIGN SENIOR NAVY DECISION MAKER ACTION SO NAVY CAN ACHIEVE
