RMKS/1.  Reference (a) announced the authorized departure for those eligible 
family members (EFMs) and civilian employees at higher risk from coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19).  References (b) and (c) announced the termination of 
all authorized departure allowances effective 11 June 2020.  References (d) 
and (e) announced the authorized departure extension to 11 July 2020.  
References (f) and (g) announced the authorized departure extension to 10 
August 2020.  References (h) and (i) announced the authorized departure 
extension to 9 September 2020.  In line with reference (j), this NAVADMIN 
announces a new global authorized departure effective 10 September
2020 to 9 October 2020.

2.  This NAVADMIN applies to those Department of Defense (DoD) EFMs and 
civilian employees who are currently at their safe haven location.  DoD EFMs 
and civilian employees who did not have travel orders approved prior to 7 May 
2020, are not permitted an authorized departure under reference (j).

3.  The Defense Travel Management Office will provide additional guidance on 
benefits payment processing under reference (j).

4.  The Department of State (DOS) announced in reference (k) that, unless 
terminated earlier, the authorized departure for individuals at higher risk 
from COVID-19 (Global Authorized Departure) will terminate on an individual 
country basis after that country has ended phase 3 of its Diplomacy Strong 
Framework.  DoD EFMs and civilian employees are required to return to their 
permanent duty station (PDS) when DOS terminates the global authorized 
departure for the country in which they are assigned.  Once the global 
authorized departure terminates for a given country or individuals are 
otherwise authorized to return voluntarily, DoD EFMs are authorized safe 
haven allowances for a grace period of up to 10 days, if necessary, for 
individuals to make arrangements to return to their PDS.  The DOS phase 
tracker can found at MyNavy Portal https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/don-covid-
19-travel-tracker.  This website requires a Common Access Card (CAC) to login 
unless the Service Member has previously set up a CAC-free account on MyNavy 
Portal.  This list should be checked frequently, as NAVADMINs will not be 
released every time a country ends phase 3.

5.  DoD EFMs and civilian employees may return to their PDS prior to the 
termination of the evacuation if the individual meets the requirements 
contained in reference (l) located at
https://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/06/2002472408/-1/-1/1/FHP-
GUIDANCE-SUPPLEMENT-12.PDF as well as the requirements below.
    a.  For countries in DOS phase 3.  Civilian employees are authorized to 
return to their PDS.  DoD EFMs may return to the PSD of their sponsor if:
        (1) their request to return is approved by their DoD component head; 
and
        (2) they will not require institutional quarantine or testing by the 
host nation.
    b.  For countries in DOS phase 2.  Civilian employees and DoD EFMs may 
return to their PDS if:
        (1) their request to return is approved by their DoD component head; 
and
        (2) they will not require institutional quarantine or testing by the 
host nation.
    c.  For countries in DOS phases 0 or 1, DoD EFMs must request approval to 
return by exception through USD PR to the DOS Under Secretary for Management.

6.  Service Members with questions regarding this NAVADMIN should contact 
MyNavy Career Center, available 24/7, by phone at (833) 330- MNCC ((833) 330-
6622) or via e-mail at askmncc(at)navy.mil.

7.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.
