PROGRAMS CHANGE 3.

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces changes to the Tuition Assistance
(TA) Program of the Navy, designed to expand the professional development 
opportunities and enhance degree completion of Sailors.
These changes support Sailor 2025 initiatives addressed in reference
(a) and help us retain our best and brightest talent.  Higher education 
opportunities lead to a more capable and engaged Sailor who thinks in terms 
of the bigger Navy team, as outlined in reference (b).

2.  Annual TA Funding updates.
    a.  Effective 1 June 2018, the 16 semester hour (SH) (or
equivalent) fiscal year limit on TA eligibility, as directed in reference 
(c), is rescinded.  Maximizing TA opportunity is an investment in our 
Sailors, and is consistent with our message that learning and professional 
growth are not only available, they are expected of senior leaders.
        (1) In line with reference (d), Sailors can now use TA up to the 
Department of Defense (DoD) fiscal year funding cap of $4,500, up from the 
previous effective cap of $4,000 (16 SH x $250).
        (2) TA will continue to be paid up to the DoD established limits, 
currently set at $250 per semester hour, $166.67 per quarter hour, or $16.67 
per clock hour.  Tuition exceeding these limits, in addition to fees, books, 
and instructional materials, will continue to be the responsibility of the 
Sailor, pursuant to reference (d).
    b.  Sailors with currently approved education plans at high cost schools 
may benefit from comparison shopping to get better value under this expanded 
authority, potentially save money, and preserve GI Bill benefits if they have 
been constrained by previous limits.
Education counselors at the Navy College Virtual Education Center
(NCVEC) and OCONUS Navy College Offices are available to discuss goals of 
Sailors and help maximize their TA benefits.
    c.  This change affords Sailors more control and flexibility in their 
pursuit of higher education.  For example, Sailors can now choose to pursue 
more credits on shore duty and fewer while on operational tours, striking a 
better work-life balance.  This can be further enhanced if Sailors choose 
more cost-effective schools.
    d.  Sailors who have already reached the former fiscal year limit as of 
the release of this NAVADMIN and have funded courses using other benefits or 
personal finances will not be eligible for a refund, retroactive payment, or 
restoration of benefits utilized for courses already completed or in 
progress.  They may, however, have additional courses funded up to increased 
fiscal year funding cap.
The following policy changes apply:
        (1) All TA, Navy College Program for Afloat College Education 
(NCPACE) distance learning (DL) courses, or any combination thereof will be 
funded at the levels listed in paragraphs 2a(1) and 2a(2).
        (2) Pursuant to reference (d), TA and NCPACE DL courses will continue 
to require the same grade attainment of C or better for undergraduate courses 
and a B or better for graduate courses.
Reimbursement will be required from service members not attaining these 
grades, to include referral of collection to Defense Finance and Accounting 
Service for separated members.

3.  All Sailors using TA or NCPACE must do their part to progress toward 
degree completion.
    a.  After conferral, Sailors should ensure degrees are posted to their 
Joint Services Transcript (JST) by requesting their academic institution 
submit an official transcript to the JST operations center.  Once placed on 
the academic page of the JST, degrees will transmit to other Navy systems.
    b.  Education counselors at the NCVEC are evaluating education records to 
identify TA recipients who may not be progressing toward degree completion 
and will coordinate with them to ensure they are on track.

4.  Sailors are encouraged to take full advantage of their eligibility to 
earn college credit through College Level Exam Program and DSST exams offered 
through the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Services, which 
can further stretch their TA dollars.

5.  The most current information on all voluntary education opportunities is 
available on the Navy College Program website at 
http://www.navycollege.navy.mil/.
