2.  The following list indicates the name, Active-Duty list number, and date

3.  Only officers who affirmatively request consideration by the selection 
board will be eligible for selection.  An officer can request consideration 
by the selection board(s) via the Letter To the Board (LTB) process, as 
outlined in paragraph 4.  Officers opting-in for consideration by multiple 
selection boards must submit a separate LTB for each board. 
 
4.  Only eligible officers who are opting-in for consideration may 
communicate with the selection board via the LTB process in accordance with 
references (a) and (b).  Reference (b) announced the introduction of a new 
application known as Electronic Submission of Selection Board Documents 
(ESSBD), accessible through MyNavy Portal (MNP).  ESSBD improves the speed, 
transparency, and confidence of receipt over current LTB submission methods, 
such as hard copy and e-mail submitted letters and related attachments. 
    a.  ESSBD will be available for all promotion, advancement, and selection 
boards. 
    b.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to electronically 
submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without attachments, 
and will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) exactly what 
will be delivered and presented to the board. 
    c.  To use ESSBD, candidates must access document services through MNP 
at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record.  On-screen instructions will 
direct the submitter thereafter. 
    d.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the board(s) to which LTBs are submitted.  If required, a full visual user 
guide is available at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-
promotion. 
    e.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command no later than 2359 
(Central Standard Time (CST)) 10 days prior to the convening date of the 
respective board, as noted below.  Submitters are cautioned to not wait until 
the deadline date to submit LTBs via ESSBD or other available avenues.

matter concerning the record of the officer that the officer considers 
important.  Written communication may include, as enclosures, correspondence 
from any individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not 
originated by the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of 
the eligible officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must 
contain a written acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she 
desires such correspondence be presented to the board. 
Correspondence without such an acknowledgement is considered third- party 
correspondence and will be returned without being presented to the 
board.  Classified correspondence will not be accepted. 
    g.  Questions or issues regarding LTB submission should be directed to 
PERS-801 by calling 1-901-874-2362 (DSN:  882-2362).

presented to the board for consideration, notwithstanding the timely

request, submitted by the officer, and not required by policy, no later than 
10 days before the convening date of the board. 
    b.  Any officer who was recommended by a previous selection board for 
appointment as an AJAG of the Navy, Legal Counsel to the Chairman of the

62nd birthday.
