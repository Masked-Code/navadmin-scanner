SUBJ/VIRTUAL COMMAND PILOT PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT//
RMKS/1.  I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NAVY 
TOTAL FORCE (TF) DOMAIN VIRTUAL COMMAND PILOT PROGRAM.  THIS PILOT 
OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION (PCS) 
COSTS FOR NAVY, GEOGRAPHICAL BACHELOR TOURS, RELOCATION STRESS, AND 
OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES FOR SAILORS AND THEIR FAMILIES ASSOCIATED 
WITH (PCS) MOVES.  IT OFFERS INDIVIDUALS THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN 
HIGH-IMPACT POSITIONS WHILE MAINTAINING GEO-STABILITY TO SUPPORT 
PERSONAL AND FAMILY NEEDS.
2.  THE VIRTUAL COMMAND PILOT WILL TEST WHETHER PHYSICAL ASSIGNMENT 
OF PARENT COMMAND MEMBERS TO AN AREA GEOGRAPHICALLY SEPARATED FROM 
OPNAV N1 AND OTHER MAJOR NAVY TF DOMAIN HEADQUARTERS STAFFS IS 
FEASIBLE BY USING TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY, COUPLED WITH A SUPPORTING 
LOCAL COMMAND STRUCTURE.  THIS PILOT WILL ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO 
REMAIN IN THEIR CURRENT GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION WHILE WORKING FOR PARENT 
COMMANDS LOCATED ELSEWHERE WITHIN CONUS.  THE PILOT WILL INITIALLY 
BE OPEN TO EIGHT (8) OFFICERS; IF SUCCESSFUL, THE PILOT MAY BE 
SELECTIVELY EXPANDED.   
3.  OFFICERS SELECTED FOR THIS PILOT WILL BE ASSIGNED TO A NAVY TF 
DOMAIN DUTY STATION WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF THEIR FLEET 
CONCENTRATION AREA (GEOGRAPHIC COMMAND), WITH AN ADDITIONAL DUTY 
ASSIGNMENT TO A NAVY TF DOMAIN BILLET LOCATED IN WASHINGTON DC OR 
MILLINGTON TN (PARENT COMMAND).  HOUSING ALLOWANCES WOULD BE PAID 
FOR THE GEOGRAPHIC COMMAND.  DEPENDENT ON THE DUTIES ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE BILLET TO WHICH THE OFFICER IS ASSIGNED, THE OFFICER COULD WORK 
PRIMARILY FROM THE NAVY TF DOMAIN DUTY STATION (GEOGRAPHIC COMMAND), 
OR FROM HIS OR HER HOME VIA A FORMAL TELEWORK AGREEMENT, OR A 
COMBINATION OF BOTH.  ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT, SUCH AS COMPLETING THE 
PHYSICAL READINESS TEST AND PHYSICAL HEALTH ASSESSMENTS, 
PARTICIPATING IN PERIODIC URINALYSIS SCREENING, AND UTILIZATION OF 
COMMAND FACILITIES, SUCH AS VTC AND NMCI CONNECTIVITY, WOULD BE 
PROVIDED BY THE GEOGRAPHIC COMMAND.  THE PARENT COMMAND WOULD 
PROVIDE AN NMCI SEAT AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT, TO INCLUDE A LAPTOP, 
DOCKING STATION, MONITOR, KEYBOARD, MOUSE, AND GOVERNMENT CELL PHONE, 
FOR THE OFFICER'S USE TO CONDUCT DAILY BUSINESS.  FITNESS REPORTS 
FOR THESE OFFICERS WILL BE SUBMITTED THROUGH THE PARENT COMMAND 
WHERE THEY REPORT FOR WORKING PURPOSES.  THE GEOGRAPHIC COMMAND 
WOULD HAVE NO INPUT INTO THESE REPORTS.
