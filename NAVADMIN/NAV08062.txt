ENGINEER CORPS, AND THE 166TH ANNIVERSARY OF NAVAL FACILITIES 
ENGINEERING COMMAND// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  THIS YEAR THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE SEABEES, CIVIL 
PAGE 02 RUCOMFB7371 UNCLAS ENGINEER CORPS, AND NAVAL FACILITIES 
ENGINEERING COMMANDS (NAVFAC) WILL CELEBRATE THREE SIGNIFICANT 
ANNIVERSARIES.  THESE DEDICATED MEN AND WOMEN FORM TOGETHER A 
CAPABILITY UNMATCHED BY ANY OTHER NATION AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE 
CRITICAL TO OUR MARITIME STRATEGY.
2.  THE SEABEES HAVE SERVED IN EVERY CONFLICT SINCE THEIR FORMATION IN 
WORLD WAR II.  WHETHER THE NEED HAS BEEN FOR A NAVAL MOBILE 
CONSTRUCTION BATTALION, AN AMPHIBIOUS CONSTRUCTION BATTALION, OR AN 
UNDERWATER CONSTRUCTION TEAM, SEABEES ANSWER UP “CAN DO” 24/7, 
WORLDWIDE.  THEY PROVIDE ADVANCED BASE CONSTRUCTION FOR OUR MARINE  
CORPS, PERFORM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ON OUR NAVAL INSTALLATIONS,  
PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND DISASTER RECOVERY IN AND OUTSIDE  
CONUS, WORK IN OUR EMBASSIES ALONGSIDE THE STATE DEPARTMENT, PROVIDE  
FUEL AND EQUIPMENT TRANSFER CAPABILITY FROM THE SEA, AND PERFORM  
ADVANCED UNDERWATER CONSTRUCTION.  THEY PROVE DAILY THAT THEY ARE THE 
ULTIMATE COMBAT CONSTRUCTION FIGHTING TEAM.
3.  SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 1867, THE CIVIL ENGINEER CORPS HAS SERVED 
PROUDLY IN OPERATIONAL UNITS ON THE FRONT LINES OF COMBAT, ASHORE ON 
MAJOR STAFFS OR IN PUBLIC WORKS CENTERS, OR IN NAVFAC SUPPORTING 
CRITICAL CONSTRUCTION EFFORTS.  WORKING SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH THE SEABEES, 
THEY ARE A PART OF THE VERY TIP OF THE NAVY’S FORWARD DEPLOYED SPEAR.  
THEY ARE THE VERSATILE CORPS THAT DELIVERS A VARIETY OF CAPABILITIES TO 
OUR NAVY.
4.  IN 1842 THE BUREAU OF YARDS AND DOCKS WAS FORMED.  THIS WAS THE 
FORERUNNER OF THE PRESENT NAVAL FACILITIES ENGINEERING COMMAND.  THE 
LOYAL PROFESSIONALS WHO COMPRISE NAVFAC HAVE A HISTORY WHICH STRETCHES 
BACK TO SERVICE DURING THE CIVIL WAR. TODAY THEY ARE INVOLVED IN 
MANAGING CONTRUCTION IN SUPPORT OF THE NAVY WORLDWIDE.
 NAVFAC?S DEDICATED PERSONNEL DELIVER SUSTAINABLE, ADAPTABLE  
FACILITIES; EXPEDITIONARY CAPABILITIES; AND CONTINGENCY RESPONSE TO  
THE NAVY EXPEDITIONARY COMBAT ENTERPRISE, ALL OTHER WARFARE AND  
PROVIDER ENTERPRISES, THE MARINE CORPS, UNIFIED COMMANDERS, AND DOD  
AGENCIES.  THEIR INNOVATION, RESPONSIVENESS, AND AGILITY ENABLE A 
FORWARD DEPLOYED, ROTATIONAL, AND SURGE CAPABLE NAVY.
5.  OUR NAVY IS A POWERFUL AND DYNAMIC FORCE WHICH IS STRENGTHEN BY OUR 
DIVERSE CAPABILITIES.  THE SEABEE/CIVIL ENGINEER CORPS/NAVFAC TEAM ARE 
VITAL TO THAT AND WHAT THEY DO MAKES AN IMPACT IN OUR NAVY AND THE 
WORLD EVERY DAY.  HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO THIS GREAT TEAM, AND KEEP 
CHARGING.
