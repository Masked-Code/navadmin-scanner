RMKS/1.  Purpose. To announce the update and revision to the Standard Navy 
Distribution List (SNDL) OPNAVINST 5400.45A and new location of the SNDL 
references. 
 
2. The SNDL OPNAVINST 5400.45A main instruction remains posted to 
Department of the Navy Issuances website. Starting December 2022, the 
SNDL references will be accessible via the DNS-12 SharePoint website 
located at: https://flankspeed.sharepoint-
mil.us/sites/OPNAV/DNS/DNS1/DNS12/SitePages/Home.aspx. SNDL sections are 
located within the Documents Library of the SharePoint website.

provide DON members up to date changes as revisions are conducted
