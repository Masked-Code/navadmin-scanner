RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Aviation 
Command Retention Bonuses (ACRB) for the Active Component (AC).  The 
FY24 Aviation Department Head Bonus (ADHRB) was addressed in 
NAVADMIN 092/24. 
 
2.  A vital part of developing a total force strategy and maintaining combat 
readiness is to provide appropriate incentives to retain skilled personnel 
for critical Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) billets.  The AC Aviation 
Command Retention Bonus (ACRB) program incentivizes highly talented, hard-
working, Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers screened for aviation 
command to choose to remain on Active Duty.  Our return on investment is the 
retention for continued Naval Service of our aviation warfighters, with their 
invaluable, irreplaceable skillsets and leadership. 
 
3.  AC ACRB: 
    a.  The AC ACRB is designed to retain those officers with the 
capabilities and command experience in our primary warfighting missions that 
are critical for the future of our Service.  Our cadre of Commander (CDR) 
Commanding Officers (CO) lead our NAE today, and they are the major 
commanders and flag officers of tomorrow.  Their skills and leadership 
experience are essential to the success of the Navy.  The FY24 ACRB 
incentivizes their continued service in follow-on assignments requiring 
senior aviation leaders. 
    b.  ACRB applicants must have screened during the Aviation Command Screen 
Board (ACSB) as CO of an eligible Operational (OP), Operational Training  
(OP-T) or Special Mission (SM) CDR command in order to apply.  Eligible 
commands are those for which the annual ACSB selects officers to serve as CO, 
excluding second-in-grade/sequential/bonus/fleet replacement squadron 
commands.  Consult the FY24 ACRB program information for specific eligibility 
criteria and limitations.  The application opportunity commences with the 
release of this NAVADMIN and closes on 20 September 2024. 
    c.  All FY24 ACRB contracts will be worth $35K to $120K. 
Participation in the FY24 ACRB obligates contracts from two to three years of 
obligated service to include full completion of a Post Command Commander 
(PCC) tour, which may be between 24 and 36 months depending on 
assignment.  The minimum ACRB obligation ends after 21 years of commissioned 
service, the projected rotation date (PRD) of the assigned PCC tour or two 
years from contract acceptance date, whichever is later and depending on 
contract length.  ACRB applications for those currently under ADHRB 
obligations will be accepted, held in abeyance, and activated upon ADHRB 
contract expiration. 
    d.  ACRB rates and obligated service are as follows: 
2 year option - $35K total ($17.5K/year), obligation ending at 21 YCS;  
3 year option - $120K total ($40K/year), obligation ending at 22 YCS.   
Sea Duty Incentive - $10K/year for each year of the contract, for those who 
report to post-command orders to operational Carrier Strike Groups (CSG), 
Carriers (CVN), and Amphibious Assault Ships (LHA/D),  up to $30K total, 
contract length dependent. 
 
4.  Additional Aviation Bonus (AvB) Information: 
    a.  Officers accepting AvB contracts are not precluded from participating 
in the Career Intermission Program (CIP).  Officers interested in both AvB 
and CIP should contact the AvB program manager and their detailer for more 
information.
