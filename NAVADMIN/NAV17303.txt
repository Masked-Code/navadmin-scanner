SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS FOR ADVANCEMENT EXAMINATION READINESS REVIEWS.//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the Advancement Examination Readiness Review 
(AERR) schedule from April 2018 to June 2018.  AERR events provide an 
opportunity for selected rating subject matter experts from fleet and shore-
based commands to impact sailorization by affecting the careers of every test 
taker in the Navy.  Selected chief, senior chief, and master chief petty 
officers on active duty, Full-Time Support (FTS), and Reservists currently on 
active duty for special work (ADSW) may take part in the process.  AERRs 
enable the Navy to advance the most qualified and rating-knowledgeable 
Sailors.

2.  AERRs are held at Naval Education and Training Professional Development 
Center (NETPDC) Pensacola, FL.  Temporary duty travel
(TDY) in support of AERR events is considered mission critical and is flag 
approved.  All costs pertaining to TDY are funded by NETPDC.

3.  In line with reference (b), TYCOMs/rating sponsors will recruit rating 
Fleet Subject Matter Experts (FSME), select AERR attendees plus two alternate 
members, and provide names and contact information no less than 45 days prior 
to the AERR convening date to NETPDC using the Saufley e-mail 
sfly_netpdc_aerr(at)navy.mil with a subject line of AERR Selectees.
