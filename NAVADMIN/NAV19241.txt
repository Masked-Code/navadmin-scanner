RMKS/1. Our Sailors and Coast Guardsmen make enormous sacrifices to serve our country and to 
execute our diverse missions. It is a covenant of leadership that we, in turn, give 100 percent of our 
support when they become wounded, ill or injured. The Navy Wounded Warrior program provides the 
framework for this support.

2. Formerly known as Navy Safe Harbor and currently as Navy Wounded Warrior Safe Harbor, effective 
immediately, the program is renamed Navy Wounded Warrior (NWW).

3. The goal of NWW is to work side by side with Navy medicine and other medical care providers to offer 
non-medical assistance to Sailors, Coast Guardsmen and their families in order to return Service 
Members to full duty.
    a. Navy medicine has long provided world-class medical care to wounded, ill and injured Service 
Members and their families. As the leading organization providing non-medical care, NWW extends that 
standard by providing individually-tailored assistance designed to optimize the success of our Service 
Members, their caregivers and families during recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration.
    b. When reintegration to full duty is not possible, NWW works collaboratively with agencies including 
the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Labor, and other federal, state and local 
organizations to ensure successful career transition and integration of Sailors, Coast Guardsmen and 
their families into the civilian community.

4. NWW case managers advocate for and provide support to Sailors and Coast Guardsmen in several 
areas including, but not limited to, pay and personnel issues, invitational travel orders, housing 
assistance and lodging arrangements, family and caregiver resources, child and youth programs, 
adaptive recreation and sports programs, legal and guardianship issues, education and training benefits 
and respite care.

5. Although NWW is a voluntary program, it is incumbent upon leaders to ensure Service Members are 
referred to NWW for assistance and to support them throughout their recovery, reintegration and 
transition to a healthy, productive life.
    a. Sailors and Coast Guardsmen of all ranks who experience combat or non-combat serious wounds, 
illnesses or injuries are eligible for referral to the NWW program. Service Members who do not meet 
NWW enrollment criteria will be provided with resources to address their concerns.
    b. There are multiple access points for referral to the program, including the following:
        (1) Self-refer by calling 1-877-746-8563 or via the NWW website at 
https://www.navywoundedwarrior.com/contact-us.
        (2) A Defense Casualty Information Program System generated personnel casualty report.
        (3) Navy medicine medical care case managers and other service medical care managers may 
contact NWW.
        (4) The Service Member's command leadership may contact NWW.

6. For more information on NWW, visit https://www.navywoundedwarrior.com,
