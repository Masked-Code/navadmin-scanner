appointment.  Selectees who decline their commission within this 10-day 
period will be considered by the FY-20 Reserve Enlisted Advancement Selection 
Boards.  After the 10-day period, PERS-802 will invalidate all FY-20 Navy 
Reserve LDO and CWO selectees' eligibility for the FY-20 Reserve Advancement 
Enlisted Selection Boards.

longer mentally, physically, morally or professionally qualified or if the 
selectee fails to meet current PFA requirements.
Immediately forward documentation citing reason to PERS-92.
