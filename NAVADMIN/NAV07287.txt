RMKS/1.  THIS MESSAGE ESTABLISHES NEW TRANSITION PROCEDURES FOR SAILORS 
IN THE NATIONAL CALL TO SERVICE (NCS) PROGRAM.  THESE CHANGES WILL BE 
INCORPORATED IN REF A.  REF B APPLIES TO NCS SAILORS WHOSE EXPIRATION 
OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE IS ON OR BEFORE 31 JANUARY 2008, AND WILL 
BE CANCELLED EFFECTIVE
1 FEBRUARY 2008.   
2.  THE NCS PROGRAM CONTINUES TO PROVIDE BOTH NEAR TERM ACTIVE DUTY 
ENLISTED MANNING CAPACITY AND OFFSET FUTURE SELECTED RESERVE MANNING 
SHORTAGES.  SINCE THE NCS PROGRAM IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE RESERVE 
RECRUITING STRATEGY, NCS SAILORS WILL ONLY BE AUTHORIZED TO REMAIN ON 
ACTIVE DUTY WHEN IT CLEARLY SUPPORTS NAVY TOTAL FORCE REQUIREMENTS ON A 
CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. 
3.  THESE NEW ADMIN PROCEDURES APPLY TO NCS SAILORS WHOSE EAOS IS 1 
FEBRUARY 2008 OR LATER. 
    A.  SERVICE SCHOOL COMMANDS SHALL ENSURE THE TRANSFERRING NCS 
SAILOR HAS 15 MONTHS OF ACTIVE DUTY REMAINING AFTER COMPLETION OF THE 
FINAL FORMAL TRAINING.  IF NECESSARY, SUBMIT AN ACTIVE DUTY EXTENSION 
TO COVER THE REQUIRED 15 MONTH PERIOD.
    B.  UPON A NCS SAILOR REPORTING TO THE PERMANENT DUTY STATION, THE 
COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR (CCC) SHALL VERIFY THE NCS SAILOR'S EAOS IS 
CORRECT.  EXECUTE EXTENSIONS OF ACTIVE DUTY AS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH 
THE 15 MONTH ACTIVE DUTY REQUIREMENT FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF TRAINING.  
THIS WILL PREVENT POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH FUTURE NCS INCENTIVE PAYMENTS.
    C.  THE CCC SHALL SCREEN THE SAILOR TO ENSURE HE/SHE IS ELIGIBLE 
FOR SERVICE IN THE NAVY RESERVE 180 DAYS PRIOR TO RELEASE FROM ACTIVE 
DUTY.  A DISQUALIFYING FACTOR INCLUDES NOT BEING RECOMMENDED FOR 
RETENTION.  IF NOT RECOMMENDED FOR RETENTION, THE MEMBER?S COMMAND WILL 
SEPARATE THE SAILOR LOCALLY AT NORMAL EAOS.  SEND WAIVER REQUESTS TO 
PERS 913. 
    D.  THE CCC SHALL ENSURE ELIGIBLE SAILORS LOG INTO CAREER 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM INTERACTIVE DETAILING (CMS ID) AND UPDATE THEIR DUTY 
PREFERENCE SHEET TO REFLECT WHERE THEY INTEND TO RESIDE AND AFFILIATE 
AFTER RELEASE FROM ACTIVE DUTY.  ON PAGE TWO OF THE DUTY PREFERENCE 
FORM, THE SAILOR MUST STATE IN THE SAILOR COMMENTS SECTION, "AFTER 
RELEASE FROM ACTIVE DUTY, I WILL BE RESIDING IN (CITY), (STATE).?
    E.  NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND (PERS 4) WILL ISSUE TEMDU PENDING 
SEPARATION (ACC 380) ORDERS TO TRANSFER THE NCS SAILOR TO A NAVY 
OPERATIONAL SUPPORT CENTER (NOSC) WITHIN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES, 
AND NEAREST THE RESIDENCE DECLARED IN CMS ID, 120 DAYS PRIOR TO RELEASE 
FROM ACTIVE DUTY.  THOSE SAILORS WHO HAVE NOT DECLARED WHERE THEY 
INTEND TO RESIDE WILL RECEIVE ORDERS TO THE NOSC NEAREST THEIR HOME OF 
RECORD.  ORDERS WILL BE ISSUED WITH A SPECIFIC REPORT NOT LATER THAN 
DATE.  UPON RECEIVING THE NCS PROSPECTIVE GAIN ORDERS, THE COMMANDING 
OFFICER OF THE NOSC SHALL ASSIGN A SPONSOR TO FACILITATE THE SAILOR'S 
TRANSITION TO THE NOSC AND RESERVE COMPONENT.  NCS SAILORS WILL RECEIVE 
REQUIRED PRE-SEPARATION COUNSELING AS REQUIRED IN OPNAVINST 1900.1D AND 
ENCOURAGED TO ATTEND TAP CLASS PER OPNAVINST 1900.2B. 
    F.  COMMANDER, NAVY RESERVE FORCES COMMAND (CNRFC) WILL SEND A 
MESSAGE TO THE SAILOR'S CO ANNOUNCING THE SAILOR'S IMPENDING EXPIRATION 
OF ACTIVE OBLIGATED SERVICE AND SUBSEQUENT TRANSFER TO THE NAVY RESERVE 
90 DAYS PRIOR TO RELEASE FROM ACTIVE DUTY. 
THE CO MUST ENSURE THE SAILOR COMPLETES A SEPARATION PHYSICAL PER 
MILPERSMAN 1900-808.
    G.  THE SAILOR'S CCC SHALL COUNSEL THE MEMBER REGARDING MANDATORY 
RESERVE OBLIGATION 30 DAYS PRIOR TO RELEASE FROM ACTIVE DUTY.  PERS 35 
WILL SEND NOTIFICATION TO DFAS REPORTING THE MEMBER?S ELIGIBILITY FOR 
INCENTIVE BONUS.
    H.  DEPENDING UPON TRAVEL TIME TO THE NOSC (NO PROCEED TIME IS 
AUTHORIZED), AND AT CO'S DISCRETION, THE SAILOR WILL TRANSFER TO THE 
NOSC IN TIME TO REPORT NOT LATER THAN 15 DAYS PRIOR TO THEIR EAOS.  THE 
SAILOR SHALL HAND CARRY THEIR SERVICE, MEDICAL, AND DENTAL RECORDS TO 
THE NOSC.  NO LEAVE WILL BE AUTHORIZED ENROUTE.  THE SAILOR SHOULD PLAN 
ON USING SEPARATION LEAVE AFTER REPORTING TO THE NOSC FOR PROCESSING.  
IF THE MEMBER DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH LEAVE TO COVER THE ENTIRE PROCESSING 
PERIOD, THE NOSC WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO MUSTER THE MEMBER PHYSICALLY, 
OR VIA TELEPHONE, UNTIL THE ACTIVE COMPONENT LOSS TRANSACTIONS POST. 
ANY ACCRUED LEAVE BEYOND THE SEPARATION LEAVE USED AT THE NOSC WILL BE 
SOLD BACK UPON RELEASE FROM ACTIVE DUTY.  UTILIZING THE SEPARATION 
ORDERS, THE SAILOR SHOULD ARRANGE FOR DEPENDENT TRAVEL AND HOUSEHOLD 
GOODS SHIPMENT PRIOR TO TRANSFERRING TO THE NOSC. 
ALL DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED BY THE SERVICING PSD WILL BE SUBMITTED BY
