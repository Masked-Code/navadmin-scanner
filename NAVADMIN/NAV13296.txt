RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN is a follow-up to ref (a).  Members should refer to the Don't Ask, 
Don't Tell post repeal page on the Navy Personnel Command web site at: 
http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-
npc/support/21st_Century_Sailor/dadt/Pages/default.aspx.  The information contained 
therein is intended to inform Navy personnel on the full list of member-designated benefits 
and the details on how eligible personnel can access these benefits.

2.  There are 20 member-designated benefits, available for eligible service members.  All 
service members may designate any beneficiary of his or her choosing for these 20 benefits 
for which they qualify.  The list of member-designated benefits is also available on the 
Department of Defense web site at:  
http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0610_dadt/Member-Designated-Benefits-List-

whom they have discontinued an association.

guide which is located on the Navy Personnel Command webpage at
