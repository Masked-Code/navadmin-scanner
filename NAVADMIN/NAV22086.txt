NARR/Reference (a) is NAVADMIN 022/22, Navy Transition to Task Management 
Tool - Announcement.  Reference (b) is NAVADMIN 025/22, Navy Transition to 
Task Management Tool - Phase I.  Reference (c) is NAVADMIN 051/22, Navy 
Transition to Task Management Tool - Phase II.// 
 
RMKS/1.  Purpose.  Per references (a) through (c), this NAVADMIN details the 
timeline and plan for Navy's completion of Phase III of the Navy's transition 
from the current system, the Department of the Navy Tasking, Records, and 
Consolidated Knowledge Enterprise Repository (DON TRACKER), to the Enterprise 
Task Management Solution System (ETMS2), commonly referred to as Task 
Management Tool (TMT).  In addition, this NAVADMIN provides leadership with a 
current state of training. 
 
2.  Way Ahead.  "Go-live" for NIPR is planned for 2 May 2022.  However, the 
DON will transition from DON TRACKER to ETMS2 NIPR/SIPR NLT 1 July 2022 and 
will be determined by the successful completion of Validation Exercises 
(VALEX) executed by the ETMS2 Accenture Training Team for organizations in 
the DON.  The go-live dates for both NIPR and SIPR will be announced by 22 
April 2022.  Once users go live in ETMS2 NIPR and SIPR, users will not be 
able to create new taskers in DON TRACKER.  It is recommended that all 
commands currently using DON TRACKER conduct a comprehensive review of their 
NIPR and SIPR taskers in DON TRACKER and close out any inactive taskers. 
Any tasker in DON TRACKER as of 1 May will continue in DON TRACKER until 
closed out. 
 
3.  State of Training 
    a. 6,100 users of the approximately 17,000 required have completed 
Beginner Training.  Beginner training is the minimum requirement for 
obtaining an account in ETMS2. 
    b. 355 users have completed Advanced Training.  While optional, current 
    users that have attended have found it to be highly useful.  Advanced 
training is highly recommended. 
    c. 100 of approximately 400 senior leaders and principal officials across 
    the Navy have completed Senior Leadership Training. 
 
4.  ETMS2 (TMT) Customer Support 
    a.  DON ETMS2 support is fully integrated with the Army Enterprise 
Service Desk-Worldwide (AESD-W).  AESD-W will serve as the ETMS2 point of 
contact for all ETMS2-related incidents, questions, and service requests 
24/7, 365 days a year. 
    b.  For NIPR ETMS2 support, submit a request to the AESD-W Self Service 
Web Portal at https://snpro.aesd-w.army.mil/ or by calling 1-866-335-ARMY 
(2769), then select prompt 1 for NIPR services, sub-prompt 1 for enterprise 
services, then select 6. 
    c.  For SIPR ETMS2 support, call 1-866-335-ARMY (2769) and select prompt 
2 for classified services, followed by sub-prompt 4 (other services). 
 
5.  For questions or concerns regarding Navy's transition to the TMT, please 
contact the Navy's ETMS2 Transition Team at 
navy_etms2_transition(at)us.navy.mil. 
 
6.  Applicability.  This NAVADMIN is applicable to commands using DON TRACKER 
as the Navy's primary Task Management Solution.
