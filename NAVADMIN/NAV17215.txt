SUBJ/2017 VICE ADMIRAL JAMES BOND STOCKDALE LEADERSHIP AWARD WINNERS//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the 2017 recipients of the Vice Admiral 
James Bond Stockdale Leadership Award.  Commander Brian M. Drechsler, former 
Commanding Officer of SEAL Team FIVE (Pacific Fleet) and Commander Eric M. 
Sager, former Commanding Officer of USS CALIFORNIA (SSN 781) (U. S. Fleet 
Forces) were selected for their inspirational leadership.

2.  This fleet award was established in honor of VADM James Bond Stockdale, 
whose distinguished naval career symbolized the highest standards of 
excellence in both personal example and leadership. The award is presented 
annually to two commissioned officers on active duty in the grade of 
commander or below who are serving in command of a single ship, submarine, 
aviation squadron, Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) team, naval special warfare 
squadron, SEAL delivery vehicle team, special boat team, explosive ordnance 
disposal mobile unit, mobile diving and salvage unit, or Navy special 
clearance team during the nomination cycle.  Candidates are nominated by 
peers who themselves must be eligible for the award.

3.  The 2017 winners were chosen from among nine outstanding finalists in a 
review process that included screening at the fleet commander level and final 
selection by a board of senior officers.
