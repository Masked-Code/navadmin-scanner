RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN, IN CONJUNCTION WITH REF A AND EFFORTS TO ADDRESS 
CRITICAL MANNING ISSUES IN OUR DEPLOYING FORCES, EXTENDS THE VOLUNTARY SEA 
DUTY PROGRAM (VSDP) OF REFS B AND C TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2013.  ADDITIONALLY, TO 
FURTHER ADDRESS SENIOR ENLISTED LEADERSHIP MANNING ISSUES IN OUR DEPLOYING 
FORCES, HIGH YEAR TENURE (HYT) WAIVERS FOR SENIOR ENLISTED SAILORS (E7-E9) 
WILL NOW BE CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH VSDP REQUESTS.

2.  IN ORDER TO OPEN THE VOLUNTARY SEA DUTY PROGRAM INCENTIVE TO ADDITIONAL 
SENIOR ENLISTED LEADERS AND TO REDUCE THE DEMAND PLACED ON THE CHIEF PETTY 
OFFICER EARLY RETURN TO SEA PROGRAM, THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL VSDP INCENTIVE 
IS OFFERED:
    A.  HYT WAIVERS (E7-E9):  DEPENDING ON RATING, SEA DUTY MANNING AND THE 
IMPACT TO FUTURE ADVANCEMENTS, HYT WAIVERS WILL BE CONSIDERED ON A CASE-BY-
CASE BASIS FOR SENIOR ENLISTED SAILORS VOLUNTEERING TO CURTAIL SHORE DUTY AND 
RETURN TO SEA, EXTEND AT-SEA, OR ACCEPT BACK-TO-BACK SEA DUTY ORDERS.  LENGTH 
OF HYT WAIVERS MUST MEET RETAINABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF 
ACTIVE SERVICE OBLISERV A MEMBER MUST HAVE UPON ARRIVAL AT A NEW DUTY STATION 
AFTER A PCS TRANSFER, BOTH IN CONUS AND OCONUS.
    B.  ONCE SAILORS NEGOTIATE AND ACCEPT ORDERS OR EXTEND AT SEA, SUBSEQUENT 
REQUESTS TO TRANSFER TO THE FLEET RESERVE BEFORE THE HYT WAIVER EXPIRES WILL 
BE DISAPPROVED.
    C.  SENIOR ENLISTED LEADERS ARE REMINDED THAT CHOICE OF GEOGRAPHIC 
LOCATION IS AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE OFFERED BY VSDP AS OUTLINED IN REFS A AND 
B.  ADDITIONALLY, IF ELIGIBLE, SEA DUTY INCENTIVE PAY (SDIP) CAN BE COLLECTED 
IN CONJUNCTION WITH VSDP.

3.  VSDP REQUESTS WILL NOT BE APPROVED FOR SAILORS HOLDING A NUCLEAR NEC 
(33XX).

4.  FOR THE NAVY TO CONTINUE MEETING WORLD-WIDE OPERATIONAL COMMITMENTS, WE 
MUST MAINTAIN AT-SEA MANNING READINESS.  THESE CHANGES WILL HELP US ENSURE 
CRITICAL SENIOR ENLISTED LEADERSHIP IS WHERE WE NEED IT MOST.
