POC/CAMARDO, LOUIS/LTCOL/NPS/-/831-656-2794/CAMARDO(AT)NPS.EDU//

RMKS/1. This message convenes and provides administrative updates for the 
execution of the Naval Research Program (NRP) Topic Review Board (TRB).

2. As a result of the Naval Research Working Group (NRWG) meeting at the 
Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), 39 Navy sponsors have submitted 237 proposed 
research topics. NPS faculty members have selected those topics on which they 
desire to conduct research during Fiscal Year 2017 (FY17) and initiated an 
Initial Research Estimate Form (IREF) for each research topic that they 
desire to have completed for NRP funding.  Those IREFs will be reviewed, 
validated as requirements, and allocated funding based on topic sponsor 
prioritized rankings at the TRB.

3. Per ref A, the TRB will convene on 15 June 2016 at the Office of Naval 
Research in Arlington, VA in order to review, validate, prioritize, and 
recommend assignment of resources toward the proposed IREFs generated as a 
result of the NRWG.

4. The TRB is led by the executive director of the Office of Naval Research. 
The board is composed of O-6 (or equivalent) representatives from every Navy 
sponsor organization with proposed work for consideration or review.  The TRB 
will verify that the proposed research is relevant, review proposals for 
combining research efforts with other existing or proposed work in order to 
avoid duplication, and recommend assignment of resources toward proposed 
research.  TRB output will be a list of Navy research to be undertaken by the 
students and faculty of NPS for FY17.  The TRB end state are vetted research 
proposals that directly address topic sponsor research requirements and are 
resourced for execution by students and faculty at NPS.

5. The TRB will be held 15 June 2016 from 0900-1200 at the Office of Naval 
Research, One Liberty Center, 875 North Randolph Street, Arlington, VA 22203 
in conference room 1454.

6. Every topic sponsor who has approved at least one IREF is requested to 
identify and send an O-6 (or equivalent) representative to participate in the 
TRB.  Every topic sponsor representative who attends the TRB is requested to 
bring their organizations list of IREFs ranked in order from highest priority 
to lowest priority.
