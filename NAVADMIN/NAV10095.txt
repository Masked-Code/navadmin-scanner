RMKS/1. TO ANNOUNCE THE 2010 NAVY AND MARINE CORPS COMBAT OPERATIONAL STRESS 
CONFERENCE, 18-20 MAY 2010.

2. THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONFERENCE IS TO BRING TOGETHER SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS 
AND STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMBAT AND OPERATIONAL STRESS CONTROL
(COSC) PROCESS AND TO PRESENT, EXAMINE, AND BECOME INFORMED ON COSC POLICIES, 
PROGRAMS, AND PRACTICES SPECIFICALLY TAILORED FOR SAILORS, MARINES, AND THEIR 
FAMILIES. TOPICS WILL INTEREST NAVY AND MARINE CORPS LEADERS, RESEARCHERS, 
TREATMENT PROVIDERS, CHAPLAINS, AND FAMILY MEMBERS. REPRESENTATION FROM 
COMMAND LEADERSHIP WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO IMPROVE EFFORTS IN PREVENTION, 
IDENTIFICATION, AND EARLY INTERVENTION TO MAXIMIZE FORCE PRESERVATION AND 
READINESS. THIS YEAR'S GOAL IS TO INTRODUCE THE NEW JOINT NAVY-MARINE CORPS 
COSC DOCTRINE AND OUR THEME, "TAKING ACTION, MEASURING RESULTS," FOCUSES ON 
IMPLEMENTING THE DOCTRINE. LEADERS AT ALL LEVELS WILL LEARN NEW WAYS TO 
STRENGTHEN OUR FORCE, RECOGNIZE STRESS INJURIES AND TACKLE THE CHALLENGE OF 
STRESS INJURIES. THE 2010 USN-USMC COSC CONFERENCE WILL FOSTER BETTER 
COLLABORATION IN PURSUIT OF THESE GOALS.
