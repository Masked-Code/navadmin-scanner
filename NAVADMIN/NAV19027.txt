RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN solicits motivated officer (O3-O5) and enlisted (E4-

2.  Established in 1931, the U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard is the official 
ceremonial unit of the Navy.  Located in Washington, D.C., the primary 
mission of the Ceremonial Guard is to represent the service in presidential, 
Joint Armed Forces, Navy, and public ceremonies in the capital of our nation 
and around the world.
Members of the Navy Ceremonial Guard participate in some the most prestigious 
ceremonies including presidential inaugurations and arrival ceremonies for 
foreign officials in our nation.  In addition, the Navy Ceremonial Guard 
conducts all services for Navy personnel and dependents buried in the 
Arlington National Cemetery.
Elements of the command, such as the U.S. Navy Drill Team and Color Guard, 
regularly represent the Navy in public events across the country.

3.  Volunteers must be strong leaders who are ready to serve as role models 
to large numbers of junior Sailors.  Volunteers must always operate with

the U.S. Navy, both on and off-duty.

(a) and the following additional requirements:

rating detailer via their commanding officer, requesting release to shore 
special programs for assignment to the U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard.  Once 
released, the shore special programs detailer will release a screening 
message to the command with application requirements.  Once the application 
package is received and reviewed, a telephone interview will be arranged with 
the U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard Command Master Chief and/or Commanding 
Officer.  Because of the challenging nature of duty onboard the U.S. Navy 
Ceremonial Guard, enlisted Sailors whose records reflect that they have 
succeeded in this assignment may be viewed positively on future enlisted
