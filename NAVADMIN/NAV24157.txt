Selective Retention (SELRET) Board. 
 
2.  The SELRET Board is required to retain TAR Captains beyond 3 
years' time in grade bringing TAR inventory in line with authorized 
end strength, allowing for stable promotion opportunity. 
 
3.  The FY25 TAR Captain SELRET Board will convene on 16 September 
2024 to consider TAR Captains in all competitive categories for 
retention.  TAR Captains who were promoted during FY23 will be 
looked at for their first gate and TAR Captains who were promoted 
during FY20 will be looked at for their second gate.  In line with 
reference (a), second gate TAR Captains not selected for retention 
will retire or be released from Active Duty no later than 1 
September 2025 and first gate TAR Captains not selected for 
retention will retire or be released from Active Duty no later than 
1 September 2026.  In either case, TAR officers will be retained on 
Active Duty, if necessary, to enable the officer to become eligible 
for a regular Active Duty retirement.
