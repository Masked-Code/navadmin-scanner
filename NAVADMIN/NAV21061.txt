REF/A/MSG/CNO WASHINGTON DC/N1/101936ZDEC20//
NARR/REF A IS NOTICE OF CONVENING FY-22 ACTIVE-DUTY NAVY PROMOTION SELECTION 
BOARDS (PART I).//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces Part II of the Notice of Convening Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2022 promotion selection boards.  Due to the delay of FY-21 
promotion selection board results, which were impacted by COVID-19 stop 
movements, the FY-22 promotion selection boards were divided into two parts.  
Part I consisted of promotion selection boards to recommend officers in the 
line and staff corps on the Active-Duty List for permanent promotion to the 
grades of captain and commander in line with reference (a).  Part II will 
consist of promotion selection boards to recommend officers in the line and 
staff corps and chief warrant officers on the Active-Duty List for permanent 
promotion to the grades of lieutenant commander and chief warrant officer.

2.  Part II of the FY-22 promotion selection boards will be convened as 
follows:

    3 MAY 2021 - Staff Corps Lieutenant Commander
    10 MAY 2021  Unrestricted/Restricted Line Lieutenant Commander
    24 MAY 2021  Chief Warrant Officer 5/4/3

3.  The Secretary of the Navy has authorized the release of the following 
list indicating the names, Active-Duty List numbers and dates of rank of the 
senior in-zone, junior in-zone, and junior officer eligible for consideration 
for promotion in each competitive category as of the date of this NAVADMIN.  
In addition, those officers on the Active-Duty List and in the same 
competitive category who are senior to the senior in-zone officer listed in 
their category are considered above-zone and are also eligible for 
consideration.

4.  For promotion to the grade of lieutenant, an All-Fully- Qualified-
Officers List (AFQOL) consisting of those officers recommended for promotion 
on their recent fitness reports will be sent to the Secretary, who will 
certify the AFQOL and forward the list with Limited Duty Officer permanent 
appointment nominations attached to the Secretary of Defense.  Those officers 
determined not fully qualified for promotion will be omitted for the AFQOL 
constituting a failure of selection (FOS).  The All-Fully-Qualified (AFQ) 
standard applies to all designators.  The AFQ standard will also be utilized 
for the mid-year active-duty lieutenant Judge Advocate Generals Corps and 
Chaplain Corps promotions and any officers administratively missed when the 
original lists were compiled.

5.  Only eligible officers may communicate with a promotion selection board 
via the letter to the board (LTB) process.  NAVADMIN 220/19 announced the 
introduction of a new application known as Electronic Submission of Selection 
Board Documents (ESSBD), accessible through MyNavy Portal (MNP).  ESSBD 
improves the speed, transparency, and confidence of receipt over current LTB 
submission methods, such as hard copy and e-mail submitted letters and 
related attachments.
    a.  ESSBD provides board candidates with the capability to electronically 
submit LTBs in a standard, consistent format, with or without attachments and 
will allow the candidate to see (for content and clarity) exactly what will 
be delivered and presented to the board.
    b.  To utilize ESSBD, candidates must access document services through 
MNP at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/my-record.  On-screen instructions will 
direct the submitter thereafter.
    c.  Submission and subsequent receipt acknowledgement for LTBs submitted 
via ESSBD or other means does not constitute confirmation of eligibility for 
the boards to which LTBs are submitted.  If required, a full visual user 
guide is available at https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/advancement-and-
promotion.
    d.  LTBs must be received by Navy Personnel Command not later than 2359 
(central standard time) (CST) 10 days prior to the convening date of the 
respective board, as noted below.  Submitters are cautioned to not wait until 
the deadline date to submit LTBs via ESSBD or other available avenues.

Selection To                     Convening Date Due Date / Time
Staff Corps Lieutenant Commander 3 MAY 21       22 APR 21 / 2359 CST
URL/RL Lieutenant Commander      10 MAY 21      29 APR 21 / 2359 CST
Chief Warrant Officer 5/4/3      24 MAY 21      13 MAY 21 / 2359 CST

    e.  If sending a board package from a non-NMCI network (bumed.mil, 
eu.navy.mil, etc.), please review procedures listed in NAVADMIN 220/19.
    f.  The written communication may call attention to the board, any matter 
concerning the record of the officer that the officer considers important.  
Written communication may include, as enclosures, correspondence from any 
individual concerning the eligible officer.  Correspondence not originated by 
the eligible officer, including endorsement to the letter of the eligible 
officer and letters written on behalf of that officer, must contain a written 
acknowledgement by the eligible officer that he or she desires such 
correspondence be presented to the board.
Correspondence without such an acknowledgement is considered third party 
correspondence and will be returned without being presented to the board.  
Classified correspondence will not be accepted.

6.  Questions regarding LTB submission should be directed to MyNavy Career 
Center by calling 1-833-330-MNCC (1-833-330-6622 / DSN: 882- 6622).

7.  The Secretary of the Navy has authorized the Active-Duty List line and 
staff corps promotion boards for the grade of lieutenant commander to reorder 
their recommended promotion list based on particular merit as allowed by 
section 616 of title 10, U.S. Code.
An officer may be placed higher on a promotion list only if the officer 
receives the recommendation of at least a majority of the members of the 
board.  For officers recommended to be placed higher on a promotion list, the 
board shall recommend the order in which those officers should be placed on 
the list.

8.  In-zone and above-zone eligible officers in the grades of lieutenant 
commander and Chief Warrant Officer 5/4/3, whose placement on the Active-Duty 
List is within one year of the convening dates of these boards, are 
automatically deferred unless they specifically request to be considered.  
The officer may waive this deferment and request consideration for promotion, 
in writing, e-mailed to NPC_Officer_SELBD_Elig_Waivers.fct(at)navy.mil or 
mailed to:

    Commander, Navy Personnel Command (PERS-802)
