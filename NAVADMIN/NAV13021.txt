RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES CHANGES TO THE FLEET RATING IDENTIFICATION 
ENGINE (FLEET RIDE) PERFORM TO SERVE (PTS) MODULE.
THE FLEET RIDE (FR) SYSTEM CONTINUES TO PROVIDE VITAL SUPPORT IN THE EXECUTION 
OF OUR FORCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS AND TOTAL FORCE STRATEGY.  DURING FY-13, 
THERE WILL BE SEVERAL CHANGES TO THE FR-PTS MODULE TO FURTHER SUPPORT OUR 
OBJECTIVE TO RETAIN OUR BEST AND BRIGHTEST SAILORS IN ORDER TO MEET CURRENT 
AND FUTURE FLEET MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS.  THESE CHANGES ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED 
BASED ON FLEET INPUT TO REDUCE CAREER COUNSELOR WORKLOAD AND TO ASSIST SAILORS 
BY ALIGNING THE PTS AND ORDER NEGOTIATION WINDOWS.

2.  SAILORS WHO HAVE NOT RECEIVED A FINAL PTS STATUS ARE CURRENTLY NOT ABLE TO 
APPLY FOR ORDERS.  THIS REDUCES THE SAILOR'S OPPORTUNITIES BY SHORTENING 
HIS/HER NEGOTIATION WINDOW FOR DESIRED ORDERS.  ADDITIONALLY, THE FR-PTS 
SYSTEM CURRENTLY GENERATES A PTS DECISION DETERMINATION LETTER EVERY MONTH, 
CAUSING CONFUSION AND ADDITIONAL WORK-LOAD FOR CAREER COUNSELORS.

3.  TO BETTER ALIGN THE FR-PTS SYSTEM WITH THE CAREER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM-
INTERACTIVE DETAILING (CMS-ID) ORDER NEGOTIATION PROCESS, THE FOLLOWING 
CHANGES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED STARTING 4 FEBRUARY 2013:
    A.  THE FR-PTS SYSTEM WILL AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE MANDATORY, CONSTRAINED 
FR-PTS SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE (SC) APPLICATIONS 15 MONTHS PRIOR TO A SAILOR'S 
PROJECTED ROTATION DATE (PRD).  THIS WILL PRECLUDE THE NEED FOR MANUALLY 
SUBMITTED APPLICATIONS.  MANUAL APPLICATIONS WILL NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE OR 
ACCEPTED.  TO ENSURE SAILORS CAN BEGIN NEGOTIATING FOR ORDERS WITH THEIR 
DETAILER AT THE NINE MONTH WINDOW, SAILORS WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT AN SC-
PRD APPLICATION FOR PROCESSING 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THEIR PRD.  SAILORS WILL 
RECEIVE LOOKS AT 12, 11, AND 10 MONTHS PRIOR TO PRD.  THIS
3 MONTH PRD WINDOW (12-10 MONTHS) APPLIES TO SAILORS WHO HAVE LESS THAN 24 
MONTHS OF CONTRACT TIME REMAINING.  (CALCULATED FROM PRD TO END OF ACTIVE 
OBLIGATED SERVICE AS EXTENDED (SEAOS)).
    B.  THE COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR IS STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLETING, 
VALIDATING FOR ACCURACY, AND SUBMITTING SC-PRD APPLICATIONS.  ALL REENLISTMENT 
ELIGIBILITY POLICY REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBMITTING FR-PTS APPLICATIONS REMAIN IN 
EFFECT (I.E., SAILORS MUST MEET REENLISTMENT ELIGIBILITY PER REF A; SAILORS ON 
LIMITED DUTY WILL APPLY IN FR-PTS BUT CANNOT USE AN APPROVED QUOTA UNTIL FOUND 
FIT FOR DUTY).
    C.  SAILORS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE A FR-PTS APPROVAL DURING THEIR PRD WINDOW 
(12-10 MONTH WINDOW) MAY STILL BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR ORDERS BY CONTACTING THEIR 
DETAILER.  BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTRACT TIME REMAINING, DETAILERS WILL 
DETERMINE IF THE SAILOR WILL REMAIN IN PLACE AT CURRENT COMMAND OR IF ORDERS 
WILL BE ISSUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SEA-SHORE FLOW.  SAILORS LEFT IN PLACE WILL 
HAVE THEIR PRD ADJUSTED TO MATCH SEAOS.  SAILORS MAY BE ABLE TO TRANSFER EVEN 
IF NOT APPROVED ON THE FINAL PTS PRD CONSIDERATION.  PER REF B, A SHORT TERM 
EXTENSION (STE) MAY BE AUTHORIZED.  HOWEVER, NO ADDITIONAL OBLISERV WILL BE 
ALLOWED WITHOUT FR-PTS APPROVAL IF THE MEMBER IS WITHIN 12 MONTHS OF SEAOS AND 
NOT ALREADY UNDER ORDERS (I.E., IF ORDERS ARE ISSUED PRIOR TO
12 MONTHS OF SEAOS, MEMBER MAY EXECUTE A STE IAW REF B).
    D.  SAILORS WHO DO NOT OBTAIN A FR-PTS QUOTA DURING THEIR PRD WINDOW (12-
10 MONTHS), WILL STILL BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT FR-PTS APPLICATIONS WHEN ENTERING 
THEIR SEAOS FR-PTS APPLICATION WINDOW.
SAILORS WITH 24-36 MONTHS OF REMAINING CONTRACT TIME WHO DESIRE A FUTURE 
ASSIGNMENT REQUIRING OBLISERV BEYOND THEIR REMAINING CONTRACT LENGTH WILL NOT 
BE ABLE TO SUBMIT A PTS APPLICATION DURING THEIR PRD WINDOW.  PTS APPROVAL IS 
NOT REQUIRED TO NEGOTIATE ORDERS.  IN THESE CASES, DETAILERS WILL CONSIDER 
WAIVERS.
    E.  PRD APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED AS "INTENDS TO SEPARATE" WILL REMAIN LOCKED 
IN THAT STATUS THROUGH THE MEMBER'S SEAOS APPLICATION WINDOW UNLESS THE 
COMMAND REQUESTS A PTS RESET BY THE ENLISTED COMMUNITY MANAGER (ECM).

4.  FR-PTS FINAL DETERMINATION LETTERS.
    A.  THE FR-PTS SYSTEM WILL ONLY GENERATE FINAL DETERMINATION LETTERS 
(I.E., DENIED FINAL-ACTIVE AND APPROVAL LETTERS).  MONTHLY DENIAL LETTERS WILL 
NO LONGER BE GENERATED.  FR WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE UIC LEVEL REPORTING THAT 
CONTAINS MONTHLY PTS STATUS FOR EVERY MEMBER ASSIGNED.
    B.  DENIED FINAL-ACTIVE (DFA) LETTERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE GENERATED AFTER 
THE LAST ACTIVE DUTY REVIEW (6 MONTHS FROM SEAOS).
HOWEVER, THE DFA LETTER WILL NO LONGER DELINEATE WHETHER A SAILOR WAS A 
VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY TYPE OF SEPARATION.  INSTEAD, THESE LETTERS WILL 
CONTAIN THE APPLICATION HISTORY THROUGH THE MEMBER'S SEAOS APPLICATION WINDOW 
TO HELP THE AUTHORIZING OFFICIAL DETERMINE MEMBER'S ELIGIBILITY FOR 
INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION PAY (ISP).  MEMBERS FOUND INELIGIBLE TO REENLIST IN 
THEIR CURRENT RATING DUE TO OTHER POLICY REASONS (E.G., THIRD PHYSICAL 
READINESS TEST FAILURE, APPROACHING HIGH YEAR TENURE, DOES NOT MEET RATING 
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS, ETC.) ARE NOT FR-PTS INVOLUNTARY LOSSES AND THE DFA 
LETTER IS NOT REQUIRED, NOR SHOULD IT BE USED, FOR ISP DETERMINATION.  IN SUCH 
CASES, FR-PTS DENIAL IS NOT THE POLICY REASON THE MEMBER CANNOT REENLIST.  
MEMBERS WHO DO NOT MEET RATING ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS MUST REQUEST ANOTHER 
RATING.  THE FR-PTS DFA LETTER IS NOT AUTHORITY FOR ISP.

5.  UNLESS SPECIFICALLY CHANGED BY THIS NAVADMIN, ALL OTHER FR PROGRAM 
POLICIES REMAIN IN EFFECT.  A COMPLETE REWRITE OF REF C IS FORTHCOMING, AND 
WILL INCORPORATE INFORMATION FROM THIS NAVADMIN AND ALL OTHER PREVIOUS 
CHANGES.

6.  NAVY PERSONNEL CAN CONTACT THE NAVY PERSONNEL COMMAND CUSTOMER SERVICE 
CENTER, AT 1866-U-ASK-NPC, (866) 827-5672 OR VIA E-MAIL AT 
CSCMAILBOX(AT)NAVY.MIL WITH QUESTIONS CONCERNING THIS POLICY UPDATE AND NEW 
FR-PTS IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES.
