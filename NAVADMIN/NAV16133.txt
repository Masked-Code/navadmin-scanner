SUBJ/IMPLEMENTATION OF RETIREMENTS AND SEPARATIONS FUNCTIONALITY WITHIN NAVY 
STANDARD INTEGRATED PERSONNEL SYSTEM OVERVIEW//

RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the phased deployment of retirements and 
separations (R and S) functionality within Navy Standard Integrated Personnel 
System (NSIPS).  The phased deployment will consist of two increments:
    a.  Increment one will allow the member to initiate the request 
electronically via the NSIPS self-service, route the request through chain of 
command for review and recommendation, and then electronically route to Navy 
Personnel Command for approval.  It will also provide transparency on the 
status of the members retirement and separation package.  Once approved, the 
retirement or separation orders will be generated within NSIPS.  Increment 
one is scheduled to be implemented in June 2016.
    b.  Increment two will allow the Personnel Support Detachment (PSD) and 
service member the ability to electronically complete and route the 
Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD-214) form, and for 
the data to be sent electronically to Defense Manpower Data Center.  It will 
also create the members checklist to track tasks associated with completing R 
and S processes.  Increment two is scheduled to be implemented in September 
2016.

2.  R and S is the first end-to-end personnel process to be re- engineered 
into NSIPS PeopleSoft 9.2 environment.  This will integrate the R and S for 
active and reserve personnel for both officers and enlisted Sailors in NSIPS.  
With the implementation of the R and S functionality within NSIPS, the system 
will provide the fleet with electronic routing for personnel separation and 
retirement processes.

3.  NSIPS-Web functional implementation will begin in June 2016 with the 
commands supported by PSD Gulfport, PSD Little Creek, and PSD Memphis.  Upon 
completion of satisfactory implementation of increments one and two at the 
initial sites, a phased roll-out will follow for all other commands supported 
by PSDs.  NSIPS Web-Afloat implementation timeline is dependent on the ship 
modernization process and will be completed in about 24 months after initial 
roll-out.  A future NAVADMIN, PayPers Newsletter, User Productivity Kit
(UPK-Training materials) and Whats New For You article on NSIPS splash page 
will provide detailed guidance on account establishment and management 
including the implementation plan and user roles and responsibilities.
