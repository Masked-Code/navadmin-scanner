SUBJ/MEMORIAL DAY/SUMMER SAFETY CAMPAIGN// 
RMKS/1. THE IDEAL SUMMER IS FULL OF RECREATION, REST, AND RELAXATION. 
YOU HARD-WORKING SAILORS DESERVE NO LESS. HOWEVER, WE START THE SUMMER 
SEASON WITH A SOMBER EVENT: MEMORIAL DAY, COMMEMORATING AMERICAN 
CASUALTIES OF MILITARY ACTION. ALONG WITH THE TRADITIONAL PICNICS AND 
TRIPS TO THE BEACH, MANY FAMILIES OBSERVE THE HOLIDAY BY VISITING 
CEMETERIES.
2. STARTING THE SUMMER WITH A SERIOUS PERSPECTIVE PROVIDES A MEANINGFUL 
OPPORTUNITY FOR LEADERS AT ALL LEVELS TO ENSURE THAT OUR PEOPLE HAVE 
APPROPRIATELY PLANNED FOR ALL OF THE UPCOMING ROAD TRIPS, OUTDOOR 
ADVENTURES, AND PARTIES. DURING THE PAST FIVE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKENDS, 
TEN SAILORS DIED IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS AND OTHER OFF-DUTY MISHAPS. 
DURING THE ENSUING FIVE SUMMERS (THROUGH LABOR DAY) 128 SAILORS WERE 
KILLED IN SIMILAR WAYS. THAT IS POTENTIALLY 128 DEATHS DUE TO FAILURES 
OF RISK MANAGEMENT, SKILL DEFICIENCIES, OR DECISION ERRORS.
3. THESE TRAGIC EVENTS DEVASTATE A FAMILY AND DO HARM TO OUR NAVY. ALL 
OF US SHOULD DO WHATEVER WE CAN, AS LEADERS OR AS SHIPMATES, TO PREVENT 
THESE UNNECESSARY LOSSES. THE PERSONAL PROCESS BY WHICH WE ENGAGE, 
TRAIN, AND SET THE EXAMPLE CAN'T STOP, BECAUSE MISHAPS AND HAZARDS 
NEVER TAKE A HOLIDAY.
4. ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, CURRENT DATA REVEALS ENCOURAGING TRENDS. WE'RE 
LOOKING AT THE BEST YEAR EVER IN FOUR OF THE EIGHT MAJOR CATEGORIES 
THAT WE TRACK, NOTABLY PRIVATE MOTOR VEHICLE FATALITIES AND OFF-DUTY 
SHORE/RECREATIONAL FATALITIES. 
DOES THAT MEAN THESE CHRONIC RISKS HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY MANAGED? NO, 
BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT YOUR PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES ARE WORKING. WE 
NEED TO KEEP THE PRESS ON AND LOOK FOR NEW WAYS TO DRIVE THE NUMBERS 
EVEN LOWER. 
5. DESPITE THE GOOD NEWS, THROUGH APRIL OF THIS FISCAL YEAR, 25 SAILORS 
HAVE DIED IN MISHAPS, INCLUDING 15 IN PRIVATE MOTOR VEHICLES. 
THE GOAL FOR THIS SUMMER, STARTING WITH THIS MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND, IS 
TO GENERATE NO MORE OF THOSE LITTLE ROADSIDE MEMORIALS, ERECTED BY 
GRIEVING FAMILIES IN MEMORY OF A SON OR DAUGHTER KILLED IN A 
PREVENTABLE MISHAP. 
WE NEED TO BE MAKING SOME GREAT MEMORIES THIS SUMMER, NOT MORE 
MEMORIALS.
