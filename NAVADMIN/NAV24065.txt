RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the renewal of the Naval Special Warfare 
(NSW) Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) Accession Bonus (AB) and this NAVADMIN 
supersedes reference (a).  Accessing NSW CWOs is a priority for the Navy.  
The NSW CWO AB is part of the Navy's overarching effort to size, shape, and 
stabilize the NSW force.
Special warfare operators and special warfare combat crewmen selected for CWO 
that meet the eligibility criteria in this NAVADMIN may apply.

2.  Program Overview.  This bonus is authorized under Section 332 of 
reference (b) and reference (c).  Effective 23 February 2024, eligible CWO 
selectees may apply for a bonus level of $45,000 for accepting a commission 
and serving on Active Duty in designators
7151 and 7171 for a 4-year bonus obligated service period.  The initial 
commissioned service obligation for CWO is 6 years and will run concurrent 
with the bonus obligation.  The Naval Special Warfare Plans and Policy Branch 
(OPNAV N137) is designated as the NSW CWO AB Program Manager.  Applicants 
should submit applications for this bonus to the program manager for 
approval, payment processing and tracking prior to their commissioning date.  
The eligibility criteria stated in this NAVADMIN can change at any time by 
the program manager if a bonus reduction is warranted based on the needs of 
the NSW community.

3.  Eligibility.  Applicants must meet the following eligibility
criteria:
    a.  Applicants must be Active Duty Service Members selected by a Navy CWO 
selection board for commissioning in designators 7151 or
7171 and accept an appointment to CWO.
    b.  Applicants must receive their Commanding Officer's (CO) written 
endorsement.  COs must ensure applications are accurate and verify applicants 
meet eligibility requirements.
    c.  CWO selectees who accept an appointment to CWO, and who are currently 
on a NSW Critical Skills Retention Bonus (CSRB) contract or SEAL/SWCC Senior 
Enlisted Retention Bonus (SSRB) contract are ineligible to receive or apply 
for a NSW CWO AB.
    d.  Upon release of Navy CWO selection NAVADMIN, Special Warfare 
Operators and Special Warfare Combat Crewmen selected and have contracted 
service under a Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) will have future SRB 
payments suspended in line with reference (d).  If an application is accepted 
for CWO appointment, all suspended and future SRB payments are forfeited.  
The command must coordinate with the servicing Transaction Support Center to 
submit a defense workload operations web system transaction to defense 
finance and accounting services to suspend all future SRB annual installments 
effective the date of commissioning.  This action must be taken no later than 
45 days prior to the commissioning date to ensure adequate processing lead-
time to prevent overpayment.  Any SRB annual installments disbursed after the 
commissioning date will be recouped.
    e.  If applicable, the NSW CWO AB service obligation for the Service 
Member will start after completion of their SRB obligated service period for 
which they were previously paid.

4.  Contract Terms.  Qualified applicants will receive a $45,000 bonus and 
will incur a 4-year Active Duty bonus service obligation from the date of 
commission, or from the end of SRB service obligation, whichever is longer.  
NSW CWO AB agreement obligations will run concurrently with any obligated 
service the officer has incurred for education or fellowships such as higher 
education.

5.  Program Execution
    a.  Applicants must submit their NSW CWO AB request letter, via their 
chain of command, to the program manager prior to their commissioning date.
    b.  Upon acceptance of an officer's agreement, the amount of the bonus 
becomes fixed and the officer incurs a firm service obligation.
    c.  Service Members will receive the bonus in a lump sum payment.

6.  Application Process
    a.  Eligible NSW CWO selectees may apply for the NSW CWO AB via their CO 
to the NSW CWO AB program manager.  Submit application via encrypted e-mail 
at SEAL_OCM@navy.mil.
    b.  Applicants may submit their application early.  However, payments 
will not be made until all eligibility criteria are met.

7.  Recoupment and Repayment Policy.  Repayment policy is governed under 
Section 373 of reference (b), and reference (e).  A Service Member of the 
uniformed services that enters into a written agreement with specified 
service conditions for receipt of a bonus is entitled to the full amount of 
the bonus if the Service Member fulfills the conditions of that written 
agreement.  If the Service Member fails to fulfill the service conditions 
specified in the written agreement for the pay, then the pay may be 
terminated, and the Service Member may be required to repay an amount equal 
to the unearned portion of the pay.

8.  Point of Contact.  The primary point of contact for NSW CWO AB program 
management is OPNAV N137 at (703)604-5008 or via e-mail at SEAL_OCM@navy.mil.

9.  This NAVADMIN will remain in effect until superseded or
