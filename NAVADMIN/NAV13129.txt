(BOL) accounts.
BOL codes:  S = selected for continuation
            N = not selected for continuation
            H = not selected for continuation - in a hold status
Commands have the option of submitting an operational waiver for up to three 
months to address a short-term impact, or a readiness appeal for a severe 
community level concern that cannot be resolved with an operational waiver.

2.  Date and process changes contained herein, supercede ref (a).

3.  Active Component (AC) and Full Time Support (FTS) personnel not selected 
for continuation must transfer to the fleet reserve or retire, as applicable, 
effective NLT 31 January 2014, unless an operational waiver is approved by the 
Deputy Chief of Naval Personnel (DCNP) to remain in an active status NLT 30 
April 2014.

4.  Selected Reserve (SELRES) and Voluntary Training Unit (VTU) personnel not 
selected for continuation must:
    a.  If eligible for non-regular retirement, request transfer to the 
retired reserve (with or without pay) with an effective date NLT 1 February 
2014, unless an operational waiver is approved by Commander, Navy Reserve 
Forces Command (CNRFC) to remain in a drilling status until an approved date 
NLT 1 May 2014.  Retired reserve without pay refers to a non-regular retired 
member who is in a retired status but has not reached the age at which the 
retiree is eligible to receive non-regular retired pay.
    b.  If not eligible for non-regular retirement, SELRES shall be 
transferred to the VTU effective NLT 31 January 2014, unless an operational 
waiver is approved by CNRFC to remain in a SELRES status until an approved 
date NLT 30 April 2014, and VTU members will remain assigned to the VTU.  
These personnel may continue to drill in the VTU until eligible for non-
regular retirement.  Member must request transfer to the retired reserve (with 
or without pay) with an 
effective date NLT the first day of the month following the month in which 
non-regular retirement eligibility is achieved.

5.  Operational waiver process:  Operational waivers should be requested only 
to mitigate short term severe operational impact which could result in 
potential mission failure, not for convenience of service member or to allow 
for transition leave/temporary duty period.  Operational waivers will be 
limited to a maximum of three months.  All waiver requests must be submitted 
NLT 31 July 2013.  
    a.  AC and FTS waiver requests will be submitted to PERS-833.  All AC and 
FTS requests must receive an endorsement from the first flag in the chain of 
command.  
    b.  SELRES and VTU waiver requests will be submitted to CNRFC (N1).  All 
SELRES and VTU requests must receive endorsement from the Echelon IV 
commander.  

6.  Readiness appeal process.  Readiness appeals should be requested only to 
mitigate severe readiness impact that cannot be resolved via an operational 
waiver, not for convenience of service member.  An approved readiness appeal 
will remove the selection for non-continuation of the member.  A command may 
submit a readiness appeal with concurrence of the member via their respective 
chain of 
command as stipulated below.  All appeals must be submitted NLT 31 July 2013.  
     a.  Eligibility:  Readiness appeals may only be initiated by the CO of a 
Sailor selected for non-continuation.  Members who have been or are being 
detached for cause or awarded non-judicial punishment/courts martial or with 
other adjudicated misconduct between 1 January 2010 and 25 April 2013 are not 
eligible to be considered for the readiness appeal process.
     b.  A readiness appeal will focus on the negative impact to unit or force 
readiness if the Sailor is separated, not for the convenience of the member.  
     c.  AC and FTS appeal requests will be routed up the administrative chain 
of command to the type commander (TYCOM).  If the TYCOM recommends approval, 
the request is forwarded to PERS-833 for further routing to Chief of Naval 
Personnel (CNP) for final disposition.  If the TYCOM does not recommend 
approval, the request is disapproved and is returned to the requesting 
command.  An electronic copy of any disapproval will be forwarded to PERS-833 
for record retention.  
     d.  SELRES appeal requests will be routed through the administrative 
chain of command via CNRFC N1 to the TYCOM.  If the TYCOM recommends approval, 
the request will be forwarded to PERS-833 for final disposition by CNP.  If 
the TYCOM does not recommend approval, the request is disapproved and is 
returned to the requesting command.  An electronic copy of disapprovals will 
be forwarded to 
PERS-833 for record retention.  
     e.  VTU appeal requests will be routed up the administrative chain of 
command to CNRFC N1.  If CNRFC N1 recommends approval, the request is 
forwarded to PERS-833 for further routing to CNP for final disposition.  If 
CNRFC N1 does not recommend approval, the request is disapproved and is 
returned to the requesting command.  An electronic copy of disapprovals will 
be forwarded to PERS-833 for record retention.  
     f.  CNP's decision is final and not subject to waiver/appeal to higher 
authority. 
     g.  All Sailors who have successfully appealed the non-continuation 
remain eligible for non-continuation at a later continuation board as well as 
standard Navy ADSEP processes.
