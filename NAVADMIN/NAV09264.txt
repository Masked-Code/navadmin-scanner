SUBJ/NAVY FAMILY OMBUDSMAN APPRECIATION DAY// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  ON BEHALF OF MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY AND 
THEIR FAMILIES SERVING AROUND THE GLOBE, I THANK THE THOUSANDS OF DEDICATED 
NAVY FAMILY OMBUDSMEN WHOSE COMMITMENT AND SERVICE SUPPORTS OUR SAILORS AND 
THEIR FAMILIES AT HOME AND ABROAD.
2.  THE EXCEPTIONAL TALENT AND TIRELESS EFFORTS OF OUR OMBUDSMEN ALLOW OUR 
SAILORS TO FOCUS ON THE MISSION AT HAND, KNOWING THEIR FAMILIES AT HOME HAVE 
THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THEY NEED.  BY PROVIDING THE INTEGRAL LINK BETWEEN 
COMMANDS AND FAMILIES, OMBUDSMEN KEEP NAVY LEADERSHIP INFORMED ON ISSUES 
FACING OUR NAVY FAMILY.
THEY KEEP OUR FAMILIES INFORMED ON ISSUES RANGING FROM PAY AND COMPENSATION TO 
CHILD CARE AND HOUSING, WHILE ALSO PLAYING A MAJOR ROLE IN CRISIS RESPONSE AND 
DISASTER PREPAREDNESS.
3.  OUR NAVY IS VERY BUSY, AND WE LIVE IN A DYNAMIC WORLD WHERE INACCURATE 
INFORMATION CAN MAKE SITUATIONS CONFUSING AND DISRUPTIVE.
OUR OMBUDSMEN KEEP THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN COMMANDS AND FAMILIES 
OPEN, MAKING AN EXTRAORDINARY DIFFERENCE. 
4.  SEPTEMBER 14TH IS THE DAY WE RECOGNIZE THE VITAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE 
DEDICATED VOLUNTEERS.  I ENCOURAGE ALL COMMANDS TO HOST APPROPRIATE FUNCTIONS 
THAT EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION.  
FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM VISIT THE NAVY FLEET AND 
FAMILY SUPPORT CENTER WEB SITE AT WWW.NFFSP.ORG 5.  AGAIN, THANK YOU TO ALL 
THE OMBUDSMEN AROUND THE WORLD FOR SERVING AND SUPPORTING OUR NAVY FAMILY.  
ALL THE BEST TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES ON THIS OMBUDSMAN APPRECIATION DAY.
