SUBJ/RETENTION - STAY NAVY CAMPAIGN// 
RMKS/1.  THIS IS THE FIRST OF A RECURRING SERIES OF MESSAGES DESIGNED 
TO ENCOURAGE OUR SAILORS TO STAY NAVY, WITH A FOCUS ON THE ADVANCEMENT 
PROGRAM.  RETAINING THE RIGHT MIX OF SKILLED AND MOTIVATED SAILORS, 
WHETHER ON ACTIVE DUTY OR IN THE RESERVES, IS CRUCIAL TO MISSION 
SUCCESS TODAY AND READINESS TOMORROW. 
2.  THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE IS AN IMPORTANT REASON WHY SAILORS STAY 
NAVY.  THE LATEST ADVANCEMENT RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES 
ARE SOLIDLY AVAILABLE ACROSS ALL ZONES.  WE ARE FOCUSING ON SUSTAINABLE 
ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE UPCOMING SEPTEMBER EXAM CYCLE BY 
CAREFULLY ANALYZING THE FY-08 COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS TO 
SHAPE OUR FORCE AND SUPPORT FUTURE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
3.  KEY INITIATIVES ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE THE MOST QUALIFIED SAILORS 
CONTINUE TO ADVANCE, SUCH AS:
    A.  E-4 TO E-6 ADVANCEMENT QUOTAS - THIS CYCLE S INCREASED 
ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY, COUPLED WITH THE MAY SRB MESSAGE, DEMONSTRATES 
OUR COMMITMENT TO HELP SAILORS STAY NAVY.  BY USING KEY BUSINESS RULES 
(SUCH AS ADVANCING TO THE FY-08 ENLISTED BILLET BASE, PROVIDING A 
SMOOTHER CYCLE TO CYCLE ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY, AND RETURNING THE 
COMBINED OVERALL ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY TO THE HIGHER LEVELS 
EXPERIENCED PRIOR TO THE REDUCTION IN END STRENGTH THAT BEGAN IN 2003) 
WE SAW THE OVERALL ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY INCREASE FROM
21.06 TO 24.93 PERCENT (+3.87 PERCENT).  THIS IMPROVED OPPORTUNITY 
RESULTED FROM OUR PLANNING FOR BOTH CURRENT REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE 
NEEDS AS NAVY REACHES THE END OF THE GLIDE SLOPE.  AS WE BEGIN TO LEVEL 
OFF IN FY-09 AND APPROACH STEADY STATE IN FY-10 AND THROUGHOUT THE FYDP, 
WE WILL CONTINUE SHAPING THE ENLISTED FORCE TO THE MOST RECENT BILLET 
BASE CHANGES.  
    B.  E-7 QUOTAS - WE ARE RETURNING TO A MORE HISTORIC LEVEL 
CONSISTENT WITH THE 20 PERCENT AVERAGE OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS.  
SIMILAR TO OUR KEY BUSINESS RULES IN DEVELOPING THE E-4 TO E-6 
ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY, WE OPTIMIZED THIS YEAR S E-7 QUOTA PLAN TO 
ACHIEVE THE BEST BALANCE OF OUR SIZING, SHAPING, AND STABILIZING 
PRIORITIES.  LOOKING AHEAD TO OUR PROJECTED FY-09 E-7 BILLET BASE, WE 
WILL PHASE-IN (OVER THREE ADVANCEMENT CYCLES) THE EXPECTED CHANGES IN 
OPPORTUNITY THAT THIS BILLET BASE WILL REQUIRE.
    C.  AWARD POINTS   NAVADMIN 141/07 ANNOUNCED THE AWARDING OF TWO 
POINTS TO THE ADVANCEMENT AWARDS FACTOR FOR SAILORS WHO HAVE COMPLETED 
GREATER THAN 90 DAYS (IN AN IA TOUR, PCS TOUR, TEMADD, OR IN ANY DUTY
STATUS) IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, HORN OF AFRICA, KUWAIT, GUANTANAMO BAY, 
CUBA, JOINT TASK FORCE 515 (USPACOM), AND JOINT 
FORCE SPECIAL TASK FORCE-PHILIPPINES (USPACOM).   
    D.  ADVANCEMENT EXAMS   NAVADMIN 139/07 PROVIDES OPERATIONAL 
COMMANDERS ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY TO ADMINISTER ADVANCEMENT EXAMS IN 
IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN AND THE HORN OF AFRICA, IF CONDITIONS PERMIT.  
EXISTING FLEXIBILITY FOR EARLY, LATE, AND MISSED EXAM CYCLES REMAIN IN 
EFFECT.  
    E.  INCREASED TUITION ASSISTANCE (TA)   THE NAVY VALUES 
EDUCATION.  PURSUING A COLLEGE CERTIFICATE OR DEGREE DEVELOPS IMPORTANT 
CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS TIME MANAGEMENT AND CRITICAL THINKING AS WELL 
AS ENHANCES VERBAL, WRITTEN AND MATHEMATICAL SKILLS.  SAILORS WHO 
COMPLETE A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE PROGRAM NOT ONLY GAIN KNOWLEDGE 
RELATED TO THEIR ACADEMIC AREA OF EMPHASIS, BUT ARE BETTER PREPARED FOR 
GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES, NEW ROLES AND ADVANCEMENT.  NAVADMIN 166/06 
ANNOUNCED TA LIMITS INCREASE TO 16 SEMESTER HOURS FROM 12 HOURS, AND 
NAVADMIN
150/07 DISCUSSES SENIOR ENLISTED EDUCATION POLICY AND THE IMPACT 
EDUCATION WILL HAVE ON FUTURE BOARDS AND THE ADVANCEMENT PROCESS.  
4.  LEADERS AT EVERY LEVEL ARE ENCOURAGED TO CLOSELY ENGAGE THEIR 
SAILORS ON THE BENEFITS OF STAYING NAVY AND USE THEIR COMMAND CAREER 
COUNSELORS AND RETENTION TEAMS.  FUTURE STAY NAVY MESSAGES WILL COVER 
TOPICS SUCH AS INDOCTRINATION AND SPONSORSHIP PROGRAMS, CAREER 
DEVELOPMENT BOARDS, NAVY COOL, QUALITY OF LIFE SERVICES, AND SO ON.  
THESE TOPICS WERE CHOSEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON EACH 
SAILOR AND THEIR FAMILY.  
5.   ADDITIONALLY, SAILORS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO ATTEND AND 
PARTICIPATE AT LOCAL CAREER MANAGEMENT SYMPOSIUMS (CMS) LED BY THE 
CENTER FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT.  YOU CAN ACCESS THE FOLLOWING LINK TO
