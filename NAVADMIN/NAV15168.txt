RMKS/1.  This message shall be read in its entirety to ensure stakeholders in 
the ship inactivation process are aware of the projected retirement schedule 
for the upcoming fiscal year, respective responsibilities and necessary 
follow-up actions.  Ship retirement decisions reflected in paragraph 2 below 
align with the Presidents Budget for 2016 or subsequent execution year 
decisions made by leadership.  Equipment removals from ships designated for 
foreign military transfer are addressed in paragraph 5 below.

2.  The projected FY16 ship inactivation schedule for inactivating U.S. 
battle force and non-battle force naval vessels is promulgated as follows to 
facilitate fleet planning efforts to conduct decommissioning continuous 
maintenance availability (CMAV) or inactivation availability (INAC):

Ship Name			  Projected Inactivation Date 	Post Inactivation 
Status
USS ALBUQUERQUE		   	03 Nov 2015		Dismantlement
USS CITY OF CORPUS CHRISTI	   	29 Mar 2016		Dismantlement
USS HOUSTON			   	29 Mar 2016		Dismantlement
USNS RAINIER				30 Sep 2016		Out of Service, In 
Reserve

3.  Ref (a) is amended to include the following change in inactivation dates 
for FY15:
Ship Name			 Projected Inactivation Date 	Post Inactivation 
Status
	USS SIMPSON			   	30 Sep 2015		Foreign Military Sale 
(FMS)

4.   For the purposes of this NAVADMIN, inactivation dates projected in 
paragraphs 2 and 3 above refer to the start of a INAC for nuclear vessels, 
the date of decommissioning for non-nuclear commissioned vessels, and the out 
of service date for non-commissioned vessels.  Decommissioning of nuclear 
vessels will occur at a later date and be reported to CNO IAW ref (b).

5.  Inactivating ships designated for FMS transfer are not to be stripped of 
installed equipment unless specifically authorized by OPNAV N9I.  Stripping 
of ships provides diminished operational capability to the Navys maritime 
partners and erodes Navys efforts to build maritime partner capacity.   Ref 
(b), Chapter 6 provides specific guidance related to the removal of installed 
equipment from ships designated for FMS.  All requests for equipment removal 
from a ship designated for FMS transfer will be submitted IAW ref (b) 
guidance.  Prior to the ships retirement,  it is the responsibility of 
COMNAVSEASYSCOM (PMS 326) to coordinate with the ships TYCOM and/or Type 
Desks on identifying non-transferable technology (to include combat systems) 
required to be removed from FMS designated ships.  COMNAVSEASYSCOM in 
coordination with COMSPAWARSYSCOM or COMNAVAIRSYSCOM , as appropriate, will 
also address the viability of sanitizing on-board classified systems to an 
acceptable level if the equipment is designated to be retained aboard and 
transferred with the vessel.    IAW ref (b), the TYCOM will address questions 
related to standard equipment removals while the ship is in stand down.   Ref 
(c) provides additional guidance for the removal and retention of equipment 
and supplies from ships designated for FMS.

6.  Per refs (b) and (d), Fleet Commanders shall submit an Organizational 
Change Request (OCR) to formally notify the Director, Navy Staff of a ships 
decommissioning effective date.     A revised OCR shall be submitted to 
adjust the effective date (by 60 days or more) due to operational schedule 
changes.   It is the responsibility of Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command 
(USFFC) and Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CPF) in coordination with their 
respective TYCOM to ensure the appropriate lower echelon commands are 
notified of any changes in the ship inactivation schedules.

7.  OCRs shall not be used when reporting the retirement of MSC ships.  MSC 
in coordination with Fleet Commanders and OPNAV resource sponsors, shall 
submit a naval message to CNO announcing the ships projected inactivation 
date, justification for the action and a planned disposition.  MSC will 
coordinate directly with COMNAVSEASYSCOM (SEA 21I) on the ships inactivation 
plan.  SEA 21I will provide additional guidance to MSC on preparing the ship 
for inactivation and subsequent lay-up.

8.  Adjustments to a battle force ships inactivation, decommissioning or 
service completion date that crosses the current fiscal year must be 
coordinated with OPNAV N9I due to reporting requirements that Navy must 
inform Congress on execution year force structure changes that differ from 
what Congress authorized/appropriated and signed into law by the President.  
OPNAV shall promulgate changes to the inactivation fiscal year as required.

9.  Ship commanding officers, masters, and officers in charge for all ships, 
shall submit a final naval message (normally transmitted in conjunction with 
the decommissioning or out-of-service ceremony) announcing  the ships 
official retirement date and include a brief history of the significant 
events in the life of the ship per ref (b).  The Naval History and Heritage 
Command (NAVHISTHERITAGE WASHINGTON DC) and Naval Vessel Register Custodian 
(NVR NORFOLK VA) shall be included as INFO addees.

10.  Released by VADM J. P. Aucoin, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, Warfare 
Systems (N9).//
