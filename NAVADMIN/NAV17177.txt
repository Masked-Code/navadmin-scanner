RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN supersedes reference (a) and continues the requirement 
for Sailors assigned to a Nuclear Training Command or holding a Nuclear Navy 
Enlisted Classification (NEC) (335X, 336X, 338X, 339X) applying to a non-
nuclear officer commissioning program to obtain conditional release from 
Nuclear field duty.

2.  To obtain a conditional release, a Sailor must submit an Enlisted 
Personnel Action Request (NAVPERS 1306/7) to the Nuclear Propulsion Program 
Management Branch (OPNAV N133) via their detailer in Enlisted 
Nuclear/Submarine Assignment Division (PERS-403). Applicants must obtain a 
conditional release prior to submitting their application for a non-nuclear 
officer commissioning program. All other requirements for application to 
officer commissioning programs are listed in reference (b).

3.  Officer accession boards are only to consider nuclear enlisted applicants 
with a conditional release included in their program application with the 
exception of those applicants listed in paragraphs 4 and 5 below.

4.  Conditional releases for the Seaman to Admiral-21 Program-Nuclear Option 
(STA-21(N)) and Nuclear Limited Duty Officer (LDO) Program are no longer 
required.

5.  Reference (c) announced the requirements for the FY-19 LDO In-service 
Procurement Board (ISPB).  For Nuclear-trained applicants, the guidance in 
reference (b) and reference (c) for the LDO ISPB is modified as follows:
    a.  The requirement of reference (c), paragraph 4.b.(2) to
obtain a conditional release for the Nuclear LDO program is cancelled by this 
message.
    b.  The Nuclear LDO ISPB will be convened as a separate administrative 
board in conjunction with the Submarine Major Command Board in November 2017.
    c.  The Nuclear LDO application must be postmarked by 1 October 2017.  
Addendums will not be accepted.
    d.  Applicants for the Nuclear LDO program are required to only complete 
pages 1, 2, 6 and 10 of the Officer Program Application (OPNAV 1420/1 (Rev 
01-08)) application.  The commanding officer/officer in charge endorsement 
located on page 10 of OPNAV 1420/1 (Rev 01-08) must contain the following 
statement:  "Applicant meets all requirements outlined in OPNAVINST 1420.1B, 
NAVADMIN XXX/17 (use the NAVADMIN # for this message), and the physical 
fitness standards of OPNAVINST 6110.1J."
    e.  The three-person interview appraisal board with associated appraisal 
sheets and medical documentation of color vision test are not required.
    f.  All Nuclear LDO applicant packages will be forwarded from the 
Enlisted Boards Branch (PERS-803) to OPNAV N133 for collating and staffing to 
Naval Reactors for screening prior to being presented to the Nuclear LDO 
ISPB.
    g.  Sailors selected for Nuclear LDO will still require a separate 
technical interview at Naval Reactors to receive a commission.  Those Sailors 
who do not successfully complete a final technical interview will maintain 
their enlisted status and not be commissioned as LDOs.  Technical interviews 
will be scheduled by Nuclear Placement and Assignments (PERS-422) and 
selectees notified via separate correspondence.
    h.  Applications submitted prior to the release of this NAVADMIN 
containing additional information no longer required do not need to be 
resubmitted.

6.  Point of contact is LCDR Christopher Carter, Nuclear Enlisted Program 
Manager, N133D, at (703) 604-5493 or via e-mail at nxag_N133d(at)navy.mil.
