RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the minimum service requirements (MSR) for 
Sailors seeking O-6 or higher certification of honorable service through 
submission of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form 
N-426 (Request for Certification of Military or Naval Service) as part of the 
naturalization process have been vacated as directed by reference 
(a).  Accordingly, the MSRs in reference(c), and as restated in references 
(d) and (f), requiring completion of 180 days of continuous Active Duty 
service or 1 good year towards regular retirement in the case of members of 
the selected reserves prior to submitting USCIS Form N-426 are suspended in 
line with reference (b). 
 
2.  All other portions of reference (d) with regard to expeditious processing 
of USCIS Form N-426 by the first O-6 or higher in the permanent or temporary 
duty chain of command remain in effect.  The first O-6 in the Sailors 
temporary or permanent chain of command must process any USCIS Form N-426 
within 30 days of submission. Certification of service requires only an 
honest assessment of the actual character of the military service of the 
Sailor as being honorable, without regard to whether security vetting is 
complete at the time of the certification. 
 
3.  In line with reference (g), active duty and reserve members who have 
served honorably for any period of time are currently eligible for expedited 
naturalization processing by submitting USCIS Form N-426 for certification by 
their respective military service. 
 
4.  Commands shall ensure members who are not U.S. citizens are aware of the 
new policy with regards to obtaining USCIS Form N-426 honorable service 
certification.  Questions concerning USCIS Form N-426 certification 
requirements should be directed to the command legal officer or nearest 
Region Legal Service Office region citizenship program manager.  References 
(a) and (e) may be found at

(Code 16) retains oversight responsibility for the U.S. Navy Naturalization 
Program.  Advice and assistance regarding naturalization laws, regulations 
and procedures are available by contacting kathlene.somerville(at)navy.mil or
