RMKS/1.  The annual Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Maintenance Awards Program 
acknowledges maintenance excellence by formally recognizing field-level 
military units responsible for outstanding achievements in maintenance 
management and production.  SECDEF presents six Department of Defense (DoD) 
wide maintenance awards to the most outstanding large, medium, and small 
organizations.  One of these six winners will be recognized as the best of 
the best and awarded the Phoenix Trophy.

2.  Competitive Categories:
    A.  Large: 1000 or more authorized personnel
    B.  Medium: 301-999 authorized personnel
    C.  Small: up to 300 authorized personnel

3.  All active and reserve component field-level commands and units 
responsible for organizational and intermediate-level maintenance on weapons 
systems and/or equipment belonging to their own unit, or to other units, are 
eligible to compete.  Examples of eligible activities include ships, 
squadrons, Fleet Readiness Centers, Naval Stations, etc.  A component of a 
command such as a repair department of a submarine base may be nominated if 
that component is assigned a Unit Identification Code (UIC) distinct from the

uniformed U.S. military personnel and DoD civilians.  The 2016 SECDEF 
Maintenance Awards competitive period covers Fiscal Year 2015.  The 2016 
awards will be presented at a formal ceremony on a date to be announced.

4.  Echelon II commanders must review and screen nominations from their 
respective commands and may submit up to two SECDEF field level maintenance 
award nominations per category to OPNAV (N4).  OPNAV (N4) will evaluate the 
nominations and forward two nominees per category to SECDEF for award 
consideration.

(a) and (b), via email, to Mr. Daniel Schrader,

requirements outlined in reference (a) with regards to the ten page 
limitation for nomination packages and the three weighted evaluation factors 
for field-level units.  Additionally, it is imperative that nomination 
packages highlight accomplishments exceeding an established baseline above 
the normal and include a separate high resolution image file of their unit
