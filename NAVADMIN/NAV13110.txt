RMKS/1.  THIS NAVADMIN ANNOUNCES REVISED ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATION DESIGNATORS (AQDS) 
AND IDENTIFYING QUALIFICATIONS FOR NAVY SPACE OPERATIONS AND SPACE  ACQUISITION 
PROFESSIONALS.  THIS MESSAGE ALSO OUTLINES THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING THE NAVY SPACE 
CADRE TO THE REVISED AQDS.

2.  PER REF A, NAVY IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A TOTAL FORCE OF SPACE PROFESSIONALS TO DEVELOP, 
PLAN, PROGRAM, ACQUIRE, OPERATE, AND SUPPORT SPACE SYSTEMS TO FULFILL SERVICE AND DOD 
REQUIREMENTS.
SPACE PROFESSIONAL AQDS IDENTIFY NAVY SPACE CADRE PERSONNEL AND INDICATE TRAINING AND 
SKILLS REQUIRED FOR NAVY AND JOINT SPACE-RELATED BILLETS.  IN LIGHT OF RENEWED STRATEGIC 
EMPHASIS ON SPACE AS PART OF NAVY'S INFORMATION DOMINANCE OBJECTIVES, THE AQDS FOR 
SPACE CADRE HAVE BEEN REVISED.

3.  PER REF B, LEGACY SPACE AQDS (VS1 THROUGH VS4) NO LONGER APPLY TO THE NAVY SPACE CADRE.  
NO LATER THAN 30 NOV 2013, PERSONNEL CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED AS SPACE CADRE SHALL REAPPLY 
FOR DESIGNATION AS SPACE CADRE OPERATIONS (AQDS VS5 THROUGH VS8) OR SPACE CADRE 
ACQUISITION (AQDS VR1 THROUGH VR3) VIA NAVY CYBER FORCES COMMAND (NAVCYBERFOR).  THE 
ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS EFFORT IS TO MORE ACCURATELY TRACK TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE LEVELS 
AS WELL AS ALIGN OUR QUALIFICATION PROCESS WITH AIR FORCE AND ARMY SPACE PROFESSIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.

4.  AFTER THE TRANSITION PERIOD, SPACE PROFESSIONALS WILL BE IDENTIFIED SOLELY BY SPACE 
OPERATIONS OR SPACE ACQUISITION AQDS,
VS5 THROUGH VS8 OR VR1 THROUGH VR3, RESPECTIVELY.  SPACE OPERATIONS AND SPACE 
ENGINEERING SUBSPECIALTY CODES (SSP) ARE UNAFFECTED BY THIS CHANGE AND WILL CONTINUE TO 
IDENTIFY PERSONNEL WITH SIGNIFICANT SPACE-RELATED EDUCATION.  GRADUATE SPACE EDUCATION 
REMAINS AN  IMPORTANT ENABLER FOR NAVY'S EFFORTS IN SPACE.  HOWEVER, POSSESSION  OF A 
SPACE SSP ALONE WILL NO LONGER IDENTIFY OFFICERS AS MEMBERS OF  THE PRACTICING SPACE 
CADRE.

5.  NAVCYBERFOR IS ASSESSING OVERALL SPACE CADRE BILLET STRUCTURE VIA A FORMAL SPACE 
MANPOWER ZERO-BASED REVIEW (ZBR).  THIS REVIEW  WILL DETERMINE SPACE-RELATED TRAINING 
AND SKILL REQUIREMENTS  THROUGHOUT THE FLEET AND DETERMINE BILLET AQD ASSIGNMENTS.

6.  AQD APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS.  ALL AQDS REQUIRE COMPLETION OF REF C, AND AT LEAST ONE 
YEAR OF SPACE EXPERIENCE.  ADVANCED AQDS HAVE ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING 
REQUIREMENTS AS FOLLOWS:
A.  SPACE PQS.  THE SPACE CADRE PQS WAS APPROVED IN 2010 AND SERVES  AS THE FOUNDATION 
QUALIFICATION FOR THE SPACE CADRE.  NAVCYBERFOR IS  THE PQS SPONSOR AND WILL DETERMINE 
PQS APPLICABILITY.
B.  JOB EXPERIENCE.  MINIMUM JOB EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENT FOR SPACE  CADRE IS ONE YEAR.  FOR 
NAVY RESERVE OFFICERS, 18 MONTHS ASSIGNED TO  A RESERVE SPACE BILLET SHALL COUNT AS ONE 
YEAR OF SPACE JOB  EXPERIENCE.  NAVY CIVILIANS SHALL ACCUMULATE SPACE JOB EXPERIENCE AT  THE 
SAME RATE AS ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL.
C.  TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.  REQUIRED COURSES FOR SPACE OPERATIONS ARE ADMINISTERED BY 
THE NATIONAL SECURITY SPACE INSTITUTE (NSSI) AND  ADVANCED SPACE OPERATIONS SCHOOL 
(ASOPS).  IN LIEU OF FORMAL SPACE  TRAINING, NAVY SPACE ACQUISITIONS PROFESSIONALS MUST 
ACHIEVE  CERTIFICATIONS PER DEFENSE ACQUISITION WORKFORCE IMPROVEMENT ACT
 (DAWIA) OF 1990.
D.  SPACE OPERATIONS AQD REQUIREMENTS IN ADDITION TO PQS:
        EXPERIENCE      TRAINING
    VS5   ONE YEAR        NA
    VS6   TWO YEARS       SPACE 200 OR SPACE WARFIGHTER PREP COURSE
 (SWPC)
    VS7   FOUR YEARS      SPACE 200
    VS8   SIX YEARS       SPACE 200 AND SPACE 300
NOTE:  THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE UPDATED IF NEW TRAINING COURSES AND OPPORTUNITIES 
BECOME AVAILABLE.
E.  SPACE ACQUISITION AQD REQUIREMENTS IN ADDITION TO PQS:
           EXPERIENCE      CERTIFICATION
    VR1   TWO YEARS       DAWIA LEVEL I
    VR2   FOUR YEARS      DAWIA LEVEL II
    VR3   SIX YEARS       DAWIA LEVEL III
QQQQ

7.  TRANSITION PERIOD
A.  THE TRANSITION PERIOD TO THE REVISED SPACE AQDS RUNS THROUGH CALENDAR YEAR 2013. 
SPACE CADRE PERSONNEL MUST REAPPLY THROUGH NAVCYBERFOR FOR DESIGNATION DURING 2013.  
AQD APPLICATION INFORMATION AND FORMS CAN BE FOUND AT THE SPACE CADRE HOME PAGE ON 
NAVY KNOWLEDGE ONLINE (NKO).
B.  EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT WAIVERABLE.  SUBMIT FITREPS,  AWARDS, AND/OR CIVILIAN 
WORK DOCUMENTATION TO VERIFY THE LEVEL OF  JOB EXPERIENCE IN SPACE OPERATIONS OR SPACE 
ACQUISITIONS.
C.  DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD, THE SPACE CADRE PQS IS WAIVED FOR  THOSE WHO MEET THE 
EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR AQDS  VS7, VS8, VR2, AND VR3 AS DESCRIBED IN PARA 
6D ABOVE.  FOLLOWING THE  TRANSITION PERIOD, THE SPACE CADRE PQS WILL BE MANDATORY FOR 
ALL AQD  APPLICATIONS.  SUBMIT TRAINING AND/OR CERTIFICATION DOCUMENTATION  ALONG WITH 
EXPERIENCE DOCUMENTATION AS DIRECTED IN PARA 7A.  D.
 DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD, ALL SPACE CADRE MEMBERS SHOULD BE  VIGILANT TO ENSURE 
THEIR RECORDS ARE ACCURATE.  AS AQDS VS1 THROUGH
 VS4 WILL BE PURGED FROM INDIVIDUAL RECORDS, MEMBERS OF THE SPACE  CADRE ARE 
ENCOURAGED TO COMMUNICATE WITH ANY STATUTORY OR  ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD FOR WHICH 
THEY MAY BE UNDER CONSIDERATION AND  ENSURE ANY INFORMATION RELATED TO SPACE TRAINING, 
EDUCATION, AND  EXPERIENCE IS SEPARATELY DOCUMENTED.
