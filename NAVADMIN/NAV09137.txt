SUBJ/MILITARY SPOUSE APPRECIATION DAY// 
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  ON MAY 8, 2009 WE WILL OBSERVE MILITARY SPOUSE 
APPRECIATION DAY.  IT IS A DAY WHERE WE HONOR OUR HUSBANDS AND WIVES 
WHO PROUDLY STAND BY US AT HOME AND AROUND THE GLOBE.  THE SUCCESS OF 
OUR MISSION COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT THEIR SELFLESS DEVOTION AND 
UNTIRING SUPPORT.  AS SUCH, THEY ARE HELD IN THE HIGHEST HONOR AND 
IMPORTANCE.
2.  WE ARE THE WORLD'S FINEST NAVY.  WE ARE DEPLOYED IN STRIKE GROUPS, 
COUNTER-PIRACY TASK FORCES, ON LAND IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, AND THE HORN 
OF AFRICA, AND CONDUCTING MISSIONS ACROSS THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF 
WARFARE - ALL MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE UNFAILING SUPPORT AND TIRELESS 
DEVOTION OF OUR SPOUSES.  WHILE WE LIVE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES, ONE THING 
REMAINS CONSTANT; THE LOVE, DEVOTION, AND LOYALTY OF OUR SPOUSES, NO 
MATTER THE MISSION, DISTANCE, TIME, OR SEPARATION.
3.  WORDS CANNOT FULLY EXPRESS THE DEPTH OF OUR GRATITUDE, BUT I URGE 
YOU TO THANK YOUR HUSBAND OR WIFE EACH AND EVERY DAY, AND LET THEM KNOW 
HOW MUCH OF AN IMPORTANT ROLE THEY PLAY IN YOUR LIFE, OUR NAVY AND 
NATION ARE BETTER FOR IT.  THIS FRIDAY, AND EVERYDAY, HONOR YOUR SPOUSE 
FOR SERVING ALONGSIDE US.  WE CAN DO WHAT WE DO IN OUR GREAT NAVY 
BECAUSE OF THEIR SERVICE AND SACRIFICE.
