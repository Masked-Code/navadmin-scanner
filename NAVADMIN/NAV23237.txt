RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides clarification on Enlisted Leader Development 
(ELD) courses of instruction, the associated requirements for completion by 
Naval Leadership and Ethics Command (NLEC) trained Fleet facilitators and 
announces Command Enlisted Leader Development public site as well as the 
associated shift to Enterprise Navy Training Reservation System (ENTRS), 
Corporate Enterprise Training Activity Resource Systems (CETARS), and Catalog 
of Navy Training Courses (CANTRAC) for all NLEC commands; including San Diego 
and Dam Neck course advertisement, and student control functions.  Student 
control and course advertisement functions for fleet facilitated courses will 
use the ELD Flank Speed SharePoint site via the ELD public website. These 
requirements will be incorporated into future revisions of references (a) 
through (c). 
 
2.  While overall responsibility for ELD rests with the unit commanding 
officer, the executive officer in conjunction with the command master 
chief/senior enlisted leader will plan, track, and ensure all Sailor's ELD 
requirements are met prior to the 2025 deadline. It is highly recommended 
that an E-7 or above is assigned as a command ELD coordinator to assist 
command leadership with tracking and planning. In line with reference (d), 
beginning in the calendar year 2025, ELD completion will be a prerequisite to 
take the Navy-wide advancement exam for E-6 and E-7 as well as a 
requirement to be eligible for selection to E-8 commencing with the Fiscal 
Year 2026 Selection Board.  It is imperative that command leadership send the 
right personnel at the right time to ELD courses to ensure personnel eligible 
for advancement have attended the appropriate ELD course leading up to the 
2025 deadline.  ELD courses for E-4s will still be available, but is not yet 
a requirement for eligibility for advancement. 
 
3.  ELD Courses of Instruction.  The Foundational Leader Development Course 
is for Sailors in paygrades E-3 and E-4.  The Intermediate Leader Development 
Course (ILDC) is for Sailors in paygrade E-5. The Advanced Leader Development 
Course (ALDC) is for Sailors in paygrade E-6.  The Chief Petty Officer Leader 
Development Course (CPO-LDC) is for Sailors in the paygrade of E-7.  All 
courses are meant to be attended once a Sailor is wearing the applicable rank 
and cannot be completed prior to being frocked or advanced.  CPO-LDC is not 
the replacement for the CPO Selectee Leadership Course ("Teaching to the 
Creed") and will not be conducted as part of CPO Initiation.  Sub-paragraphs 
3a through 3e provide clarification on ELD program deployment. 
    a.  ELD courses of instruction may only be taught by properly qualified 
CPOs.  The Command Navy Leader Development Facilitator (C-NLDF) certification 
course is for CPOs, senior chief petty officers (SCPO), and master chief 
petty officers (MCPO) and certifies them to facilitate Foundational Leader 
Development Course (FLDC), ILDC, and ALDC to the Fleet.  Only SCPOs or MCPOs 
who have completed C-NLDF may attend the CPO Command Navy Leader Development 
Facilitator Certification Course (CPO C-NLDF).  CPO C-NLDF is a separate 
course from C-NLDF, which certifies SCPOs and MCPOs to facilitate CPO-LDC. 
    b.  Course Length.  ELD courses are formal courses of instruction and 
will not be shortened, edited, or otherwise altered. FLDC and ILDC are both 
3-day courses of instruction.  ALDC is a 4-day course of instruction.  CPO-
LDC is a 5-day course of instruction.  The curriculum for all course lines is 
designed to be 8 hours of facilitation and instructional time per 
day.  Requests to deviate from this schedule will be sent through NLEC points 
of contact listed in paragraph 7. 
    c.  Class Size.  FLDC, ILDC, ALDC, and CPO-LDC classes will have a 
minimum of 8 students and a maximum of 20.  NLEC-led virtual FLDC, ILDC, and 
ALDC courses have a minimum class size of 8 and a maximum of 16.  The C-NLDF 
and CPO C-NLDF courses are offered exclusively in person and are only hosted 
by NLEC staff with a minimum class size of 8 and a maximum of 12 students. 
    d.  Coalition Approach.  ELD is designed around the concept of a shared 
effort across the Navy's CPO Mess.  NLEC is responsible to conduct 25 percent  
and Dam Neck schoolhouses.  Qualified ELD course facilitators throughout the 
Fleet are intended to pick up 75 percent of the Fleet's needs via command-
hosted classes.  ELD courses are best facilitated by CPOs outside of a 
student's chain of command to enable a diversity of thoughts and ideas on 
difficult topics. 
    e.  Other Considerations.  Only current NLEC staff facilitators are 
authorized to facilitate virtual FLDC, ILDC, and ALDC classes. The CPO-LDC 
course is not offered virtually.  A minimum of two qualified facilitators is 
required to conduct all ELD courses whether at NLEC or a local command.  Only 
NLEC personnel qualified as a Master Navy Leader Development Facilitator are 
authorized to qualify other personnel to facilitate ELD courses. 
 
4.  Migration to CETARS, CANTRAC, and ENTRS.  NLEC San Diego and Dam Neck 
have successfully migrated to CETARS, ENTRS, and CANTRAC as the primary means 
to create and advertise ELD classes, control quotas, approve student 
reservations, and convene and graduate classes via CETARS.  Student 
reservations for NLEC San Diego and Dam Neck hosted classes will be completed 
by individual command training departments using ENTRS.  Command training 
officers and training departments are advised to include the student's e-mail 
and first CPO in the chain of command's e-mail when creating reservations for 
notifications of class seat approvals or changes.  ELD course schedules will 
be posted in CANTRAC and separated by career development programs (CDP) for 
NLEC San Diego and Dam Neck.  Training departments will ensure reservations 
are being made for the correct CDP location.  Course completion for NLEC-
hosted ELD courses will automatically populate into a Sailor's electronic 
training jacket. 
 
5.  The MyNavy Portal quick link for ELD will no longer be utilized. The ELD 
public site is the primary website for ELD information, course descriptions, 
and enrollment.  Fleet facilitators hosting ELD classes will continue to use 
the ELD Sharepoint via ELD's public site by clicking on the enrollment tab at 
the following link: https://www.netc.navy.mil/ELD/.  Student reservations for 
non-NLEC hosted classes will be made using the ELD sharepoint via ELD's 
public website.  It is imperative that Sailors add the first CPO in their 
chain of command on the application form.  It is also imperative that upon 
course completion, Sailors take either their graduation certificate or class 
roster back to the command's training department to have their training 
logged in the Fleet Training Management and Planning System (FLTMPS).  Fleet-
hosted ELD classes do not automatically populate in the member's electronic 
training jacket and must be loaded via FLTMPS. 
 
6.  Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Course Equivalency.  Special Warfare Operator 
(SO) and Special Boat Operator (SB) Sailors in paygrade E-6 must complete the 
NSW leading petty officer (LPO), or Naval Special Warfare Development Group 
(NSWDG) LPO courses in lieu of ALDC. Further, SO and SB Sailors in paygrade 
E-7 must complete the NSW platoon leader or NSWDG team leader courses in lieu 
of the CPO-LDC course.
