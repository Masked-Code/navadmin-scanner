1.  The annual Robert T. Mason Award for Depot Maintenance Excellence is 
presented to the most outstanding depot-level maintenance program, product 
line or project, which has exemplified responsive, innovative, and 
transformational support to the Department of Defense (DoD). This award is 
named in recognition of Robert T. Mason, the former Assistant Deputy Under 
Secretary of Defense for Maintenance Policy, Programs, and Resources.  Mr. 
Mason served as a champion of organic depot maintenance for three decades, 
while helping to transform organic depot-level maintenance operations.

2.  All major organic depot maintenance activities are eligible to nominate a 
program, workload, team, or product line within their organizations to 
compete for this award.  The 2016 Robert T. Mason Depot Maintenance 
Excellence Award competitive period covers Fiscal Year 2015. The 2016 award 
will be presented at a formal ceremony on a date to be announced.

3.  Echelon II commanders must review and screen nominations from their 
respective commands and may submit one nomination package to OPNAV (N4) from 
each major organic depot-level facility.  OPNAV (N4) will evaluate these 
nominations and forward Navy finalists to the SECDEF for award consideration.

4.  Each nomination package must be submitted in accordance with references 
(a) and (b), via email, to Mr. Daniel Schrader, 
Daniel.l.schrader(at)navy.mil.  Please pay special attention to the 
requirements outlined in reference (a) with regards to the ten page 
limitation for nomination packages and the three weighted evaluation factors 
for field-level units.  Additionally, it is imperative that nomination 
packages highlight accomplishments exceeding an established baseline above 
the normal and include a separate high resolution image file of their unit 
logo (minimum of 300 DPI JPG file).
