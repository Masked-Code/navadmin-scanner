RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces changes to the format and enrollment 
requirements of the U.S. Navy Senior Enlisted Academy (SEA).  SEA is the only 
professional military education (PME) institution of the Navy dedicated to 
senior enlisted personnel.
Changes to this program outlined below are based on extensive input from the 
Fleet in the form of surveys, course critiques and active dialogue with 
enlisted leaders to identify critical objectives of the course and barriers 
to completion.

2.  In order to meet current and future demand, the SEA will continue to 
offer nine classes per year, but effective October 2020 a stepped approach 
will increase student throughput from 1,296 to 1,782 senior enlisted leaders 
annually.  Current class size is 144 students per class with an end goal of 
growing each class to 198 students.

3.  Beginning Fiscal Year 2021, the distance learning portion of the program 
will be streamlined to better accommodate the operational commitments and 
demands on our Sailors.  These changes will also better align curriculum with 
the Culture of Excellence of the Navy and the critical skills required of our 
senior enlisted leaders.
Distance learning will be delivered in a 3-week block, mirroring the amount 
of time students will stay in residence.

4.  The program schedule will be as follows:
    1 week   Administrative Processing (No Academics)
    3 weeks - Distance Learning
    1 week   Administrative Processing (Travel Admin)
    3 weeks - In-Residence (Newport, RI)

5.  Additionally, the Navy Primary Professional Military Education (PPME) or 
Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education (SEJPME) are no longer 
required for enrollment or completion of the SEA.  The requirements for 
Professional Military Education are adequately addressed in Senior Enlisted 
Selection Board convening orders and precepts.  Reference (b) will be updated 
to reflect these changes.

6.  For additional information and to view the course schedule, refer to the 
SEA website via MyNavy Portal at 
https://www.mnp.navy.mil/group/training-education-qualifications/t-training-
communities and select Senior Enlisted Academy.

7.  The SEA points of contact are the Course Director, at 
coursedirector.sea(at)usnwc.edu, (401) 841-4944, and SEA Lead Faculty 
Advisor, at LFA.sea(at)usnwc.edu, (401) 841-4471.

8.  This message will remain in effect until superseded or canceled, 
whichever occurs first.

9.  Released by Vice Admiral John B. Nowell, Jr, N1.//
