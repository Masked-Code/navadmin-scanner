RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN announces the fiscal year (FY) 2021 Active Component 
(AC) Aviation Command Retention Bonus (ACRB), authorized in line with 
references (a) and (b).  The FY-21 AC Aviation Department Head Retention 
Bonus (ADHRB) is addressed in reference (c). 
 
2.  The AC ACRB is designed to retain those officers with the capabilities 
and command experience in our primary warfighting missions that are critical 
for the future of our service.  Our cadre of commander (CDR) commanding 
officers (CO) lead our Naval Aviation Enterprise today, and they are the 
major commanders and flag officers of tomorrow.  Their skills and leadership 
experience are essential to the success of the Navy.  The FY-21 ACRB 
incentivizes their continued service in follow-on assignments requiring 
senior aviation leaders. 
    a.  ACRB applicants must have screened on the FY-21 Aviation Command 
Screen Board (ACSB) as CO of an eligible operational, operational training, 
or special mission CDR command in order to apply.  Eligible commands are 
those for which the annual ACSB selects officers to serve as CO, excluding 
second-in-grade/sequential/bonus/fleet replacement squadron 
commands.  Consult the FY-21 ACRB program information for specific 
eligibility criteria and limitations.  The application opportunity commences 
with the release of this NAVADMIN and closes on 31 August 2021. 
    b.  All FY-21 ACRB contracts will be worth $100,000.  All eligible 
officers will receive an initial payment of $34,000 and two anniversary 
payments of $33,000.  Participation in the FY-21 ACRB obligates contractees 
to three years of obligated service to include full completion of a post 
command commander (PCC) tour, which may be between 24 and 36 months depending 
on assignment.  ACRB obligation ends at the completion of 22 years of 
commissioned service, the projected rotation date of the assigned PCC tour, 
or three years from contract acceptance date, whichever is later.  ACRB 
applications for those currently under ADHRB obligations will be accepted, 
held in abeyance and activated upon ADHRB contract expiration. 
 
3.  Additional ACRB Information 
    a.  Officers accepting ACRB contracts are not precluded from 
participating in the career intermission program (CIP).  Officers interested 
in both ACRB and CIP should contact the ACRB program manager and their 
detailer for more information. 
    b.  For further ACRB details, eligibility and application procedures,
