RMKS/1.  This NAVADMIN provides guidance for the administrations of the 
September 2024 (Cycle 264) Navy-Wide Advancement Exams (NWAEs) and Rating 
Knowledge Exams (RKEs). 
    a.  In line with reference (a), all Active Duty Sailors in the DC and ABE 
ratings will be administered a RKE, which is executed through the NWAE 
process.  However, advancement will be conducted via Advance to Position 
(A2P) and Command Advance to Position (CA2P).  Reference (a) and associated 
fact sheets should be read in their entirety. 
    b.  In line with reference (b), all other Active Duty and Training and 
Administration of the Reserve (TAR) Sailors will take NWAEs to compete for 
advancement via NWAE Advance to Vacancy legacy advancements. 
 
2.  In line with references (b) and (c), the Enlisted Advancement Worksheet 
(EAW) is the authoritative source of data used to 
determine Cycle 264 E5 and E6 eligibility. 
    a.  Commands are to accurately validate, complete, and finalize all EAWs 
in the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS). 
    b.  For some ABE and DC Sailors, Educational Services Officers (ESOs) may 
be required to wait until the effective advancement date for the applicable 
paygrade is updated before an EAW can be created manually. 
    c.  EAW discrepancies may be addressed via the Post-exam Administration 
Comment (PAC) process after worksheets are locked for the cycle. 
 
3.  Cycle 264 timeline: 
    a.  31 July 2024:  Professional Military Knowledge – Eligibility Exam 
(PMK-EE) completion.  In line with reference (d), PMK-EE remains mandatory 
once per paygrade for all E5 and E6 candidates to be eligible for NWAE cycle 
participation.  Refer to reference (e) regarding special exceptions for E4 
new accessions. 
    b.  5 September 2024:  E6 exam administration.  EAW will close one week 
after the exam date on the worksheet. 
    c.  12 September 2024:  E5 exam administration.  EAW will close one week 
after the exam date on the worksheet. 
    d.  Deviation from administration dates.  In line with reference (b), 
commands that require rescheduling of NWAE or RKE administration date (with 
valid reason) may request a deviation of NWAE or RKE administration from Navy 
Personnel Command (PERS-803). If authorized, administration will be completed 
by 30 September 2024. 
 
4.  Eligibility requirements are found in chapter 2 of reference (b).   
The following information is specific to Cycle 264: 
    a.  Terminal Eligibility Date (TED):  1 January 2025. 
    b.  In line with reference (a), there is no minimum Time-in-Rate (TIR)

        (1) E6 - 1 January 2022 
        (2) E5 - 1 January 2024 
        (3) E6 candidate TIR requirements for Early Promote (EP) can be 
waived by one year with Commanding Officer (CO) or Officer-In-Charge (OIC) 
approval.  EAW must be created manually for all who receive that waiver.  EP 
candidates are still bound by the same PMK-EE deadline as regular TIR 
candidates. 
    d.  High-Year Tenure (HYT) date:  In line with references (f) and (g), 
the HYT Plus Pilot program allows for Sailors to continue their Navy careers 
beyond the HYT limits.  References (f) and (g) should be read in their 
entirety.  In the EAW, the "HYT Exceeded" entry may reflect "Yes" - when

(Top Secret or Secret) or CO/OIC Interim clearance dated prior to 1 September 
2024.  If clearance is revoked, an exam is not authorized until the 
discrepancy is corrected.  An eligibility determination of "No Determination 
Made" constitutes an unfavorable adjudication. 
    f.  Performance Mark Average (PMA).  Compute PMA for E5 candidates and 
Reporting Senior's Cumulative Average (RSCA) PMA for E-6 candidates in line
