RMKS/1.  THIS MESSAGE ANNOUNCES IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NAVAL 
SPECIAL WARFARE (NSW) ALTERNATIVE FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE (AFMS).  
THE NSW AFMS WILL BE USED BEGINNING WITH THE JANUARY 2011 
ACTIVE E7 EXAM (CYCLE 210) TO DETERMINE E7 SELECTION BOARD 
ELIGIBILITY (SBE) FOR THE SPECIAL WARFARE OPERATOR (SO) AND 
SPECIAL WARFARE BOAT OPERATOR (SB) RATINGS.

2.  BACKGROUND.  THE NSW AFMS PILOT PROJECT, ANNOUNCED IN 
REF A, HAS SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED OVER THE PAST THREE 
YEARS THAT INCORPORATING COMMUNITY-SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE-RELATED 
FACTORS INTO E7 SBE CALCULATIONS WILL IMPROVE THE PROCESS FOR 
DETERMINING SO AND SB BOARD ELIGIBILITY.  THE CENTER FOR SEAL 
AND SWCC (CENSEALSWCC) CONDUCTED THE PILOT PROJECT IN CLOSE 
COORDINATION WITH NSW LEADERSHIP AND THE NAVAL EDUCATION AND 
TRAINING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY CENTER (NETPDTC).

3.  THE NSW AFMS ADDS FIVE PERFORMANCE FACTORS TO THE CURRENT 
E7 FMS FACTORS OF EXAM STANDARD SCORE (SS) AND PERFORMANCE 
MARK AVERAGE (PMA).  THE NSW AFMS WILL CONSIST OF THE FOLLOWING 
SEVEN FACTORS:
    A.  LEADERSHIP:  MEASURES TIME SPENT IN SPECIFIC 
LEADERSHIP POSITIONS;
    B.  OCONUS DEPLOYMENTS:  MEASURES TIME SPENT DEPLOYED OCONUS;
    C.  QUALIFICATIONS:  MEASURES OPERATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS 
AND CERTIFICATIONS ESSENTIAL TO CURRENT AND FUTURE 
WARFIGHTING CAPABILITY;
    D.  AWARDS:  MEASURES AWARDS USING STANDARD POINTS FOR NAVY 
AWARDS PER REF B;
    E.  ETHOS:  ACCOUNTS FOR BEHAVIORAL ISSUES, E.G. 
NON-JUDICIAL PUNISHMENT (NJP), DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE (DUI), 
OR PHYSICAL FITNESS ASSESSMENT (PFA) FAILURES, BY DEDUCTING 
POINTS WITH A REDUCTION OF IMPACT OVER TIME;
    F.  EXAM SS:  RESULTS FROM THE E7 EXAM CALCULATED BY 
NETPDTC; AND
    G.  PMA:  CALCULATED PER REF B.
4.  NSW AFMS POINT CALCULATION DETAILS AND FACTOR WEIGHTS 
WILL BE DISSEMINATED IN A SEPARATE COMNAVSPECWARCOM GENADMIN.

5.  A UNIQUE FEATURE OF NSW AFMS IS THAT FACTOR POINTS FOR 
LEADERSHIP, OCONUS DEPLOYMENTS, QUALIFICATIONS, AWARDS, AND 
ETHOS WILL BE CALCULATED USING INFORMATION IN EACH CANDIDATES 
ELECTRONIC SERVICE RECORD (ESR) IN THE NAVY STANDARD 
INTEGRATED PERSONNEL SYSTEM (NSIPS).  ALL E7 ELIGIBLE SO AND 
SB CANDIDATE'S SHOULD REVIEW THEIR ESR WITH THE ASSISTANCE 
OF THE COMMAND CAREER COUNSELOR OR EDUCATIONAL SERVICES 
OFFICER TO ENSURE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF INFORMATION 
RELATED TO NSW AFMS FACTORS.  SERVICE MEMBERS SHOULD BE 
PREPARED TO PRODUCE AUTHORITATIVE DOCUMENTS RELATED TO 
QUALIFICATIONS, AWARDS, AND DEPLOYMENTS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY 
CAPTURED IN NAVY ELECTRONIC RECORDS SYSTEMS.   

6.  THE NSW AFMS WILL NOT BE IMPLEMENTED FOR THE NSW RESERVE 
COMMUNITY AT THIS TIME.  THE STANDARD E7 FINAL MULTIPLE SCORE 
WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED TO DETERMINE SBE OF RESERVE SO AND 
SB E7 CANDIDATES.
